2. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting for rapid message processing
3. **Message Size**: No validation for message payload sizes

### 7. Performance Assessment

**Score**: 9/10 ✅

#### ✅ Performance Strengths:

1. **Efficient State Updates**: Targeted updates instead of full data refresh
2. **Message Queuing**: Prevents overwhelming UI with rapid updates
3. **Health Monitoring**: Reasonable 30-second intervals for health checks
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Small 10ms delays between message processing

#### ✅ Optimization Decisions:

1. **Batched Processing**: Message queue processes items sequentially with delays
2. **Targeted Fetching**: Only fetch specific tickets when needed
3. **Conditional Validation**: State validation only when connections appear stale
4. **Efficient Cleanup**: Proper interval cleanup on disconnection

#### ⚠️ Performance Considerations:

1. **Memory Growth**: WorkflowTracker keeps all active workflow data in memory

## Specific Code Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Critical Issues: None Found ✅

### 2. Minor Issues and Improvements:

#### Issue 1: Memory Management in WorkflowTracker
**Location**: `backend/main.py:125-141`
**Issue**: Completed workflows are deleted but no periodic cleanup for stale workflows
**Recommendation**: Add periodic cleanup for abandoned workflows:
```python
def cleanup_stale_workflows(self, max_age_seconds: int = 3600):
    """Clean up workflows older than max_age_seconds"""
    current_time = time.time()
    stale_workflows = [
        ticket_id for ticket_id, workflow in self.active_workflows.items()
        if current_time - workflow["start_time"] > max_age_seconds
    ]
    for ticket_id in stale_workflows:
        del self.active_workflows[ticket_id]
```

#### Issue 2: Race Condition in Stage Updates
**Location**: `backend/main.py:343-353`
**Issue**: Gap between database update and WebSocket message could allow race conditions
**Recommendation**: Use database transactions or locks:
```python
async def update_stage_with_notification(ticket_id: int, old_stage: str, new_stage: str):
    """Atomic stage update with notification"""
    async with database_lock:
        await update_ticket_stage(ticket_id, new_stage)
        workflow_tracker.update_stage(ticket_id, old_stage, new_stage)
        await manager.send_json({
            "type": "stage_updated",
            "ticket_id": ticket_id,
            "old_stage": old_stage,
            "new_stage": new_stage
        })
```

#### Issue 3: Message Queue Memory Growth
**Location**: `frontend/src/stores/tickets.js:359-366`
**Issue**: No maximum queue size or memory protection
**Recommendation**: Add queue size limits:
```javascript
async handleWebSocketMessage(data) {
  // Prevent queue overflow
  if (this.messageQueue.length > 100) {
    console.warn('Message queue overflow, dropping oldest messages')
    this.messageQueue = this.messageQueue.slice(-50)
  }

  this.messageQueue.push(data)
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

#### Issue 4: Error Stage Determination
**Location**: `backend/main.py:500-502`
**Issue**: Error stage previous stage detection may be inaccurate
**Recommendation**: Track current stage before error occurs:
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Get current stage before error
    current_ticket = await get_ticket(ticket_id)
    current_stage = current_ticket.get('stage', 'unknown') if current_ticket else 'unknown'

    await update_ticket_stage(ticket_id, "errored")
    await manager.send_json({
        "type": "stage_updated",
        "ticket_id": ticket_id,
        "old_stage": current_stage,
        "new_stage": "errored"
    })
```
