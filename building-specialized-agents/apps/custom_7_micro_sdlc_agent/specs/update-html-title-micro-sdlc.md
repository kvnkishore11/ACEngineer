# Update HTML Title to "Micro SDLC - Plan, Build, Review"

## Codebase Analysis

Based on my research of the existing codebase, I've identified the following key findings:

### Current Title Implementation
- **File:** `/frontend/index.html` (line 7)
- **Current Title:** "Plan, Build, Review and Ship Agents"
- **Technology Stack:** Vue 3 + Vite frontend application
- **App Header:** Also displays the same title with emoji prefix "🚀 Plan, Build, Review and Ship Agents"

### Project Structure
- Frontend application using Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia for state management
- Single HTML entry point with Vue.js SPA mounting to `#app` div
- Consistent theming system with CSS custom properties for light/dark modes
- Kanban board workflow stages: Idle → Plan → Build → Review → Shipped/Errored/Archived

### Naming Convention
- Project name in package.json: "micro-sdlc-frontend"
- Application follows a micro SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) pattern
- Current branding emphasizes the full workflow including "Ship Agents"

## Problem Statement

The user wants to update the HTML page title from "Plan, Build, Review and Ship Agents" to "Micro SDLC - Plan, Build, Review". This change:

1. **Simplifies the title** by removing "and Ship Agents"
2. **Adds brand identity** with "Micro SDLC" prefix
3. **Maintains core workflow concepts** of Plan, Build, Review
4. **Aligns with project naming** (matches "micro-sdlc-frontend" package name)

## Technical Approach

This is a straightforward HTML title update that requires:

1. **Single file modification** - Only `index.html` needs to be changed
2. **No breaking changes** - Title change doesn't affect functionality
3. **Consistent branding** - Consider whether app header should also be updated for consistency
4. **SEO/Browser tab improvement** - New title will be more concise and brandable

### Architecture Decision: Title vs App Header Consistency

**Option 1:** Update only HTML title (minimal change)
- Pro: Follows user's exact request
- Con: Creates inconsistency between browser tab and app header

**Option 2:** Update both HTML title and app header (recommended)
- Pro: Maintains consistent branding throughout the application
- Con: Slightly larger scope than requested

**Recommendation:** Start with HTML title only as requested, then suggest app header update for consistency.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Update HTML Title

**File:** `/frontend/index.html`

**Current code (line 7):**
```html
<title>Plan, Build, Review and Ship Agents</title>
```

**New code:**
```html
<title>Micro SDLC - Plan, Build, Review</title>
```

### Step 2: Verify Change

1. **Build verification**: Ensure Vite build process still works correctly
2. **Browser testing**: Confirm new title appears in browser tab
3. **Responsive testing**: Verify title displays properly across different browser widths

### Step 3: Optional Consistency Update

If consistency is desired, also update the app header in `/frontend/src/App.vue` (line 6):

**Current code:**
```vue
<h1 class="app-title">🚀 Plan, Build, Review and Ship Agents</h1>
```

**Suggested new code:**
```vue
<h1 class="app-title">🚀 Micro SDLC - Plan, Build, Review</h1>
```
