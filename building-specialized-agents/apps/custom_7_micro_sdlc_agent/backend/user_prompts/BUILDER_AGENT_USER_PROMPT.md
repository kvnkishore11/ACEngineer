# Build

Follow the `Workflow` to implement the `PATH_TO_PLAN` then `Report` the completed work.

## Variables

PATH_TO_PLAN: {PATH_TO_PLAN}

## Workflow

- If no `PATH_TO_PLAN` is provided, STOP immediately and ask the user to provide it.
- Read the plan at `PATH_TO_PLAN`. Think hard about the plan and implement it into the codebase.

## Report

- Report all the files you've just created with a `git diff --stat` command and nothing else.
