// take the I wnat to create a kanban style board with 6 stages plan, build, test, review, document, PR, Errored

this should be a loclahost or any desktop based app which can select its project with open projects where in the root folder is placed. 

what i am envisioning is that all the commands within .claude/commands are the prmitives like implement, plan, prime, build 

Each Feature will have its own pipeline visualisation. before the entry into pipeline it should have github issues sort of input to type things in. 

All basic logging should be visible within the cards of the adw feature.

then I want to create a folder agentics which has many foldres like specs, ai-docs, app-docs, scripts, agents, adws.

within the adws there are different types of ai developer workflows like plan, build, review, test, document, plan-build, plan-build-document, logs

So what I am looking for is to give a choice for the use to select the pipeline depending on the issue - its nature and severity

REMEMBER: This is only Frontend based. We may not need a backend.
