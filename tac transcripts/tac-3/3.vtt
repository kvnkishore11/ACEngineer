52
00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:30.584
a big way. It's

53
00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:32.903
the software development lifecycle.

54
00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:35.043
Throughout tactical Agentic Coding,

55
00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:36.242
we'll break down the

56
00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:38.480
software development lifecycle into

57
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.439
five concrete steps and

58
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.379
use them as our

59
00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:43.438
framework for success. This

60
00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.677
compressed, focused version of

61
00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:47.555
the software development lifecycle

62
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:48.734
is built for phase

63
00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.114
two of the generative

64
00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:52.293
AI age. Plan, code,

65
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.072
test, review, document. Over

66
00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.631
the next seven lessons,

67
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.971
we're going to augment

68
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.388
and automate key steps
