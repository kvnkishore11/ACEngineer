730
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.152
with the logs exactly

731
00:16:31.152 --> 00:16:31.951
as we asked. And

732
00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:32.591
we can of course

733
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.010
open up the server.py

734
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.072
file, to manually validate

735
00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:37.292
this, we are going

736
00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:38.392
to standard out. There's

737
00:16:38.392 --> 00:16:39.250
the basic logging. We

738
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.490
can do a all

739
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.309
file reference and we

740
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.769
can see it's in

741
00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:43.587
main and server. Fantastic.

742
00:16:43.687 --> 00:16:44.486
So this chore was

743
00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:45.486
completed. We now have

744
00:16:45.927 --> 00:16:47.985
no print statements inside

745
00:16:48.044 --> 00:16:49.203
of our codebase,

746
00:16:49.203 --> 00:16:49.943
right? Here's a search

747
00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:51.442
all no prints. It's

748
00:16:51.462 --> 00:16:53.640
all logging or logger,

749
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.720
right? Let me turn

750
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.740
on regex and there

751
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.078
we go. So fantastic.

752
00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:58.158
Let me close all

753
00:16:58.158 --> 00:16:59.169
this. Now the question

754
00:16:59.169 --> 00:17:00.048
is how far can
