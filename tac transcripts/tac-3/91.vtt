00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:31.086
to improve them, not

2158
00:45:31.086 --> 00:45:32.266
if, but when things

2159
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:33.166
go wrong, right? This

2160
00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:34.204
is engineering. Things will

2161
00:45:34.204 --> 00:45:35.005
go wrong. But in

2162
00:45:35.005 --> 00:45:36.184
the next lessons, you'll

2163
00:45:36.184 --> 00:45:37.244
be equipped with the

2164
00:45:37.244 --> 00:45:38.603
tools to get back

2165
00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:39.483
on track and then

2166
00:45:39.483 --> 00:45:41.302
template your engineering so

2167
00:45:41.302 --> 00:45:43.101
that future agents stay

2168
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:44.679
on track. This lesson

2169
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.619
puts you three steps

2170
00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:47.235
closer toward becoming an

2171
00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:49.032
engineer they can't replace.

2172
00:45:49.032 --> 00:45:50.110
Great work here. Take

2173
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.108
a moment, review some

2174
00:45:51.108 --> 00:45:52.327
of the resources available

2175
00:45:52.327 --> 00:45:52.885
to you in your

2176
00:45:52.885 --> 00:45:54.422
loot box below, dial

2177
00:45:54.422 --> 00:45:55.565
in, to this key

2178
00:45:55.565 --> 00:45:57.003
tactic of agentic coding,

2179
00:45:57.083 --> 00:45:59.382
template your engineering. This

2180
00:45:59.382 --> 00:46:00.302
is how you scale
