852
00:18:59.498 --> 00:19:00.936
fully reusable. It's gonna

853
00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:01.915
create a plan that

854
00:19:01.915 --> 00:19:02.795
we can then iterate

855
00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:04.053
on and fire off.

856
00:19:04.093 --> 00:19:07.050
Resolve major issue, our

857
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.028
SQL statements not being

858
00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.047
escaped, user input into

859
00:19:11.047 --> 00:19:12.676
SQL. That's it. We've

860
00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:13.855
just described the problem

861
00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:14.474
at a high level.

862
00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:16.153
We've templated our engineering

863
00:19:16.153 --> 00:19:17.672
into how we solve

864
00:19:17.672 --> 00:19:19.170
bugs. And now our

865
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.808
agent is going to

866
00:19:19.808 --> 00:19:21.167
create this plan for

867
00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:22.267
us. All right, so

868
00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:23.278
there it is. Of

869
00:19:23.278 --> 00:19:24.457
course, we enabled thinking

870
00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:25.277
mode. We always wanna

871
00:19:25.277 --> 00:19:26.836
throw more compute at

872
00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:28.355
the problem, right? Especially

873
00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:28.815
as we start to

874
00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:30.453
scale this up. Just
