1867
00:39:29.463 --> 00:39:30.143
and back and forth.

1868
00:39:30.322 --> 00:39:32.242
This is just scratching

1869
00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:33.302
the surface. This is

1870
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:35.041
barely valuable compared to

1871
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:35.800
what we'll be able

1872
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.679
to do when we

1873
00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:38.179
scale up one agent,

1874
00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.498
two agents, five agents,

1875
00:39:39.498 --> 00:39:41.097
10 agents across the

1876
00:39:41.097 --> 00:39:42.498
software development lifecycle. All

1877
00:39:42.597 --> 00:39:44.157
right. Plans are critically

1878
00:39:44.157 --> 00:39:45.835
important. Plans are prompts

1879
00:39:45.856 --> 00:39:47.614
scaled. Great planning is

1880
00:39:47.614 --> 00:39:48.635
great prompting. When you

1881
00:39:48.635 --> 00:39:49.574
save your plans into

1882
00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:50.233
your codebase, you

1883
00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:52.072
create artifacts that you,

1884
00:39:52.072 --> 00:39:52.893
your team and your

1885
00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:54.411
agents can reference. You

1886
00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:55.112
can also think your

1887
00:39:55.112 --> 00:39:57.010
plans as staging environments

1888
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.369
for code that will

1889
00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.288
be generated, right? It's
