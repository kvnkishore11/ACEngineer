1326
00:28:59.442 --> 00:29:00.961
ask a lot of

1327
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:03.101
higher order activity on

1328
00:29:03.101 --> 00:29:03.740
the work that you're

1329
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.641
doing. This is the

1330
00:29:04.641 --> 00:29:05.820
great part, right? Because

1331
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.500
just like in some

1332
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.640
programming languages where we

1333
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.299
pass functions into functions,

1334
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.359
we have higher order

1335
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:11.400
prompts. And so that

1336
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.559
means that the implement

1337
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.700
prompt here can do

1338
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.259
different things and shape

1339
00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:16.538
the work and shape

1340
00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:18.439
the repeatable success that

1341
00:29:18.439 --> 00:29:19.778
you can template into

1342
00:29:19.778 --> 00:29:20.479
your codebase that

1343
00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:22.498
you can systematize into

1344
00:29:22.498 --> 00:29:23.657
your codebase. And

1345
00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:24.298
so you can see

1346
00:29:24.298 --> 00:29:26.413
here, Our agent is

1347
00:29:26.594 --> 00:29:27.792
on the testing step.

1348
00:29:27.792 --> 00:29:28.893
It's creating that test

1349
00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:30.912
SQL injection step. We
