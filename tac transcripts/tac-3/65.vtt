1505
00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:30.465
up a new file

1506
00:32:30.685 --> 00:32:31.305
and I'm going to

1507
00:32:31.305 --> 00:32:32.683
start writing out our

1508
00:32:32.683 --> 00:32:33.762
prompt so here we

1509
00:32:33.762 --> 00:32:35.621
have yet another template

1510
00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:36.640
where we have encoded

1511
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.419
our engineering best practices

1512
00:32:38.419 --> 00:32:39.936
in to the template,

1513
00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:40.796
right? We're using this

1514
00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:42.115
syntax here to have

1515
00:32:42.115 --> 00:32:43.953
the agent update specific

1516
00:32:43.953 --> 00:32:45.432
parts of the template

1517
00:32:45.451 --> 00:32:46.530
to create the plan,

1518
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:47.411
right? And this is

1519
00:32:47.411 --> 00:32:48.089
all based on the

1520
00:32:48.089 --> 00:32:49.348
instructions. You know, you

1521
00:32:49.348 --> 00:32:50.107
have full access to

1522
00:32:50.107 --> 00:32:51.047
this codebase, take

1523
00:32:51.047 --> 00:32:52.266
these, make them your

1524
00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:52.905
own, make a couple

1525
00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:53.644
of tweaks and just

1526
00:32:53.644 --> 00:32:54.584
get one running. You

1527
00:32:54.584 --> 00:32:55.203
wanna get to that

1528
00:32:55.203 --> 00:32:56.662
first aha moment as

1529
00:32:56.662 --> 00:32:58.201
fast as possible. Let's

1530
00:32:58.201 --> 00:32:59.200
turn our attention back

1531
00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.919
to our blank files.

1532
00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.008
We're gonna run slash
