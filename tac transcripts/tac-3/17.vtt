338
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:30.721
looking through our server,

339
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:31.541
it's thinking through these

340
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:32.360
changes. Let's go ahead

341
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.260
and full screen the

342
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.320
terminal. And now it's

343
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.278
going to create a

344
00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:37.616
comprehensive plan to replace

345
00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:38.697
all print statements with

346
00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:40.274
proper Python logging, just

347
00:08:40.274 --> 00:08:41.274
as we asked, right?

348
00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:41.774
If we hit up

349
00:08:41.774 --> 00:08:42.793
here, we can see

350
00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:44.192
that exact prompt that

351
00:08:44.192 --> 00:08:45.013
we ran. We kicked

352
00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.092
off a reusable prompt

353
00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:46.873
and then we passed

354
00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.131
in just one string.

355
00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:49.491
We're writing a high

356
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:50.811
level prompt, which is

357
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:52.110
a prompt that's void

358
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.809
of detail. Fantastic. Now

359
00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:54.690
we have a new

360
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.570
plan that details exactly

361
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.828
how to convert all

362
00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:58.688
of our print statements

363
00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:00.288
with proper Python logging.
