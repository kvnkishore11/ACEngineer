1190
00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:00.273
a single agent. We

1191
00:26:00.273 --> 00:26:01.752
want to improve our

1192
00:26:01.752 --> 00:26:03.771
KPIs. Okay. We want

1193
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:04.711
to increase the size

1194
00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:05.291
of work we can

1195
00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:06.152
hand off. We want

1196
00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:07.851
to decrease our attempts.

1197
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:08.830
We want to increase

1198
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:09.730
our streak and we

1199
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.362
want to decrease our

1200
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:13.280
presence KPI to zero.

1201
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.140
All right. That means

1202
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.138
we need to at

1203
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:16.298
the right node of

1204
00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:17.957
the software development lifecycle,

1205
00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:20.056
kick off new instances

1206
00:26:20.096 --> 00:26:22.134
with no previous context.

1207
00:26:22.255 --> 00:26:23.473
Okay. Said another way,

1208
00:26:23.614 --> 00:26:24.752
we need to decouple

1209
00:26:24.752 --> 00:26:26.551
our performance from the

1210
00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:28.950
conversational context window. And

1211
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.128
by conversational, I mean
