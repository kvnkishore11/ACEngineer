1349
00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:30.912
SQL injection step. We

1350
00:29:30.912 --> 00:29:31.872
have another test coming

1351
00:29:31.872 --> 00:29:32.991
up there, manual test

1352
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:33.991
script. That all looks

1353
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:34.691
good. This is a

1354
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:35.451
really big idea. We're

1355
00:29:35.451 --> 00:29:36.230
going to be working

1356
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.730
with different types of

1357
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:40.089
prompts, meta prompts, templates,

1358
00:29:40.329 --> 00:29:41.589
and higher order prompts

1359
00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:42.189
where we're passing in

1360
00:29:42.189 --> 00:29:43.449
prompts into prompts to

1361
00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:45.827
leverage and generate outcomes.

1362
00:29:45.887 --> 00:29:46.567
Okay. We have a

1363
00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:47.667
new primitive to work

1364
00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:48.468
with here, right? We

1365
00:29:48.468 --> 00:29:49.846
have a gentic prompts

1366
00:29:49.846 --> 00:29:50.547
thanks to the core

1367
00:29:50.547 --> 00:29:51.586
four where we can

1368
00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:53.425
execute arbitrary tools, our

1369
00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:55.150
agent, Claude Code, with

1370
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.250
the powerful models it

1371
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.809
has is smart enough

1372
00:29:57.809 --> 00:29:58.309
to know how to

1373
00:29:58.309 --> 00:29:58.909
do a lot of

1374
00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:00.209
work over a long
