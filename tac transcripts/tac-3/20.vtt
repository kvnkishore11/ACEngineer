412
00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:01.116
understand what this prompt

413
00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:02.395
does. If we go

414
00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:03.495
into preview mode here,

415
00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:04.014
you can see we

416
00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:05.854
have a prompt chore

417
00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:07.232
planning. And so every

418
00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.293
great prompt contains a

419
00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:09.572
purpose right at the

420
00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:10.572
top. Here we have

421
00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:11.711
a reusable prompt that

422
00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.030
looks ordinary, but the

423
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.909
instructions in this prompt

424
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.109
completely changes your engineering

425
00:10:17.129 --> 00:10:18.448
impact. So we're asking

426
00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:19.128
our agent to create

427
00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:19.807
a new plan in

428
00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:21.248
the specs directory to

429
00:10:21.248 --> 00:10:22.886
resolve the chore using

430
00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:24.745
the specified plan format,

431
00:10:24.826 --> 00:10:26.825
follow the instructions to

432
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.345
create the plan, use

433
00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:29.524
the relevant files to

434
00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:30.524
focus on the right
