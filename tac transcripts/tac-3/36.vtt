a plan. This pattern,

803
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.558
these concepts are ultra,

804
00:18:03.578 --> 00:18:05.278
ultra powerful. We are

805
00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.057
templating our engineering. I

806
00:18:07.057 --> 00:18:07.655
hope you can see

807
00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:08.635
where this is going.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.095
Chores, bugs, features, front

optimization, net new code

812
00:18:14.432 --> 00:18:15.412
bases, all of it.

813
00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:17.332
Experiments, literally all of

814
00:18:17.332 --> 00:18:18.530
it. I mean, all

815
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.010
of it can be

816
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.569
templated. Don't limit yourself.

817
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:21.609
Don't make the mistake

818
00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:22.549
in thinking that Gen

819
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:24.148
AI can't solve your

820
00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:25.169
problem in a major

821
00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:26.107
way. If for some

822
00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:27.988
reason you're right, and

823
00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:28.686
there's a very small

824
00:18:28.686 --> 00:18:29.866
probability of that, trust

825
00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:31.326
me, you will be
