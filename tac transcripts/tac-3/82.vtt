1937
00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:00.744
right? Our agent just

1938
00:41:00.744 --> 00:41:01.983
wrote the first draft

1939
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:02.824
of this plan for

1940
00:41:02.824 --> 00:41:03.704
us and maybe the

1941
00:41:03.704 --> 00:41:05.264
final draft, okay? This

1942
00:41:05.264 --> 00:41:06.063
is why templates are

1943
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:06.742
so important. We can

1944
00:41:06.742 --> 00:41:07.943
see the agent is

1945
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.103
done. Now imagine this

1946
00:41:09.103 --> 00:41:10.443
happens in the cloud

1947
00:41:10.623 --> 00:41:12.043
where agentically all you

1948
00:41:12.043 --> 00:41:12.742
do is pass in

1949
00:41:12.742 --> 00:41:13.663
the high level work

1950
00:41:13.663 --> 00:41:14.262
that you want done.

1951
00:41:14.262 --> 00:41:15.523
And sometimes, you know,

1952
00:41:15.543 --> 00:41:16.322
the high level prompt

1953
00:41:16.322 --> 00:41:17.782
isn't enough for a

1954
00:41:17.782 --> 00:41:18.742
feature, right? For something

1955
00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.543
larger. You might want

1956
00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:20.702
more detail here, right?

1957
00:41:20.822 --> 00:41:21.922
That's totally cool, right?

1958
00:41:21.922 --> 00:41:23.001
This is where human

1959
00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:23.762
in the loop planning

1960
00:41:23.762 --> 00:41:24.681
your work is still

1961
00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:26.802
ultra important. Templating lets

1962
00:41:26.802 --> 00:41:28.634
you move faster, and

1963
00:41:28.634 --> 00:41:29.414
let your agent do

1964
00:41:29.414 --> 00:41:30.193
the hard work of
