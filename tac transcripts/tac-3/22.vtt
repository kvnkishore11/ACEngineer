458
00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:00.904
into and leverage our

459
00:11:00.904 --> 00:11:02.604
agent to write plans

460
00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:03.803
with us and for

461
00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:04.663
us. Now we can

462
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:05.543
take that idea a

463
00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:06.302
step further. Let me

464
00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:07.042
go back into preview

465
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:07.981
mode here. We can

466
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.480
see the plan format.

467
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.080
Okay. So we requested

468
00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.240
this agent creates a

469
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.538
new plan in the

470
00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:15.798
specified markdown format. We

471
00:11:15.798 --> 00:11:17.421
are giving our agent

472
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:19.000
a template. Okay. So

473
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.559
you can see here,

474
00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.580
there's the plan format.

475
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.339
We have the chore

476
00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:22.019
at the top, chore

477
00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:24.278
description, relevant files, step-by-step

478
00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:26.197
tasks, validation, and then

479
00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:27.975
notes. And of course

480
00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:29.254
this lines up with

481
00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:30.673
exactly what was generated.
