1305
00:28:29.977 --> 00:28:31.316
inside of your higher

1306
00:28:31.316 --> 00:28:32.375
order prompts. We have

1307
00:28:32.375 --> 00:28:32.954
a whole set of

1308
00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:35.233
reusable instructions. Our implement

1309
00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:37.252
can run any spec

1310
00:28:37.373 --> 00:28:38.353
that we generate and

1311
00:28:38.353 --> 00:28:40.192
it'll actually get the

1312
00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:41.171
work done. Many, many,

1313
00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.471
many different modes we

1314
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:43.910
can run our implement

1315
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.009
plan in. For instance,

1316
00:28:45.068 --> 00:28:45.828
you could write a

1317
00:28:45.828 --> 00:28:47.448
new higher order implement

1318
00:28:47.448 --> 00:28:48.727
prompt that read your

1319
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.385
plan, implemented it, and

1320
00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:50.865
then it can have

1321
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:52.204
a set of instructions

1322
00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:53.644
saying, you know, after

1323
00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:55.883
you implement, review the

1324
00:28:55.883 --> 00:28:58.122
work completed against the

1325
00:28:58.122 --> 00:28:59.442
plan. Okay. You can

1326
00:28:59.442 --> 00:29:00.961
ask a lot of
