273
00:06:58.653 --> 00:07:00.112
Let's hit upload data

274
00:07:00.112 --> 00:07:01.333
and select our user

275
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.971
data here. Show users

276
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:04.651
with age between 20

277
00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:06.050
and 40. We'll fire

278
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.250
that off. As before,

279
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.531
our natural language query

280
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:09.970
application is working as

281
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.341
expected. Ages 20 through

282
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:13.920
40. If we open

283
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.598
up the terminal here,

284
00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:16.177
we can see that

285
00:07:16.177 --> 00:07:17.596
standard out is getting

286
00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:18.637
written. And if we

287
00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:19.355
wanted to, we could

288
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:20.196
boot up a cloud

289
00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:21.675
code instance and have

290
00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:22.894
it read in all

291
00:07:22.894 --> 00:07:23.752
of the output of

292
00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:24.992
our servers so that

293
00:07:24.992 --> 00:07:26.132
it can make changes

294
00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:27.411
for us. Great. Now

295
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:28.810
let's run our first

296
00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:30.708
template and understand the
