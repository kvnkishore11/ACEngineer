1606
00:34:29.052 --> 00:34:30.050
was running. And we

1607
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.228
can of course also

1608
00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:32.286
go into the server,

1609
00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:32.965
we can CD into

1610
00:34:32.965 --> 00:34:34.554
app server, Then we

1611
00:34:34.554 --> 00:34:35.652
can, of course, ourselves

1612
00:34:35.652 --> 00:34:36.833
just run UV run

1613
00:34:37.032 --> 00:34:37.913
pie test. All right,

1614
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:38.751
there it is. So

1615
00:34:38.771 --> 00:34:39.411
we know that all

1616
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:40.112
this is working. We

1617
00:34:40.112 --> 00:34:40.791
have this brand new

1618
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:42.070
test SQL injection file.

1619
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.751
We can look through

1620
00:34:42.751 --> 00:34:44.349
it and validate all

1621
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.909
the work that was

1622
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:45.768
done. This is great.

1623
00:34:46.048 --> 00:34:46.509
We're not gonna do

1624
00:34:46.509 --> 00:34:47.409
that here. It's not

1625
00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:47.869
a good use of

1626
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:48.847
our time here, but

1627
00:34:48.847 --> 00:34:49.547
we can see, you

1628
00:34:49.547 --> 00:34:50.027
know, even through some

1629
00:34:50.047 --> 00:34:51.527
manual testing and validation,

1630
00:34:51.746 --> 00:34:53.166
we have our concat

1631
00:34:53.166 --> 00:34:54.286
working. We have all

1632
00:34:54.286 --> 00:34:55.085
of our tests running.

1633
00:34:55.324 --> 00:34:56.844
Our agent is properly

1634
00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.664
comprehensively building plans from

1635
00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.222
our templates. It's acknowledging
