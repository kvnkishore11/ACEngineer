00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:00.554
happening right here relatively

1235
00:27:00.554 --> 00:27:01.873
small you can really

1236
00:27:01.873 --> 00:27:03.192
scale up the size

1237
00:27:03.353 --> 00:27:05.113
of both your template

1238
00:27:05.113 --> 00:27:05.972
and then the plan

1239
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:07.093
that gets generated from

1240
00:27:07.093 --> 00:27:08.372
your template right so

1241
00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:09.251
this is why we

1242
00:27:09.251 --> 00:27:10.531
use fresh agents over

1243
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.451
and over and over

1244
00:27:11.471 --> 00:27:13.011
by running fresh agents

1245
00:27:13.071 --> 00:27:14.632
on meta prompting templates

1246
00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.490
and planning assets we

1247
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.090
can understand what went

1248
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.230
wrong by knowing exactly

1249
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.411
what was in the

1250
00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:22.490
context window when i

1251
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.269
boot up this agent

1252
00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:24.190
right when i when

1253
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.269
i set this up

1254
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:26.269
i know 100% I

1255
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:27.429
know what the agent's

1256
00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:29.367
perspective is. We fired

1257
00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:31.166
off the implement markdown
