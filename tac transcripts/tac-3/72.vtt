1683
00:35:59.547 --> 00:36:00.527
are not the same

1684
00:36:00.527 --> 00:36:01.646
types of engineering work.

1685
00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:02.306
So you want to

1686
00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:04.007
differentiate each one of

1687
00:36:04.007 --> 00:36:04.746
these. We're going to

1688
00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:05.545
run that, but we're

1689
00:36:05.545 --> 00:36:06.465
not going to run

1690
00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:07.726
it inside of a

1691
00:36:07.726 --> 00:36:09.929
manual instance. Right? We

1692
00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:10.688
want this to run

1693
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:11.849
on its own in

1694
00:36:11.849 --> 00:36:13.108
a box on some

1695
00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:15.086
device somewhere else. Okay.

1696
00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:16.246
So what we're going

1697
00:36:16.246 --> 00:36:16.786
to do is open

1698
00:36:16.786 --> 00:36:17.425
up a terminal and

1699
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:18.244
we're going to replicate

1700
00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:19.244
that by firing this

1701
00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:20.744
off using claw code

1702
00:36:20.983 --> 00:36:22.822
in its programmatic form.

1703
00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:23.822
All right. Here's what

1704
00:36:23.822 --> 00:36:24.181
we're going to do.

1705
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:24.561
We're going to take

1706
00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:26.041
this prompt and we're

1707
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:26.639
going to wrap it

1708
00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:27.039
here. I'm going to

1709
00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:28.518
say claw dash P

1710
00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:29.438
and then we're going

1711
00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:30.597
to wrap this in
