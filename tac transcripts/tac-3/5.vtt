00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.096
a new tactic that

91
00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:33.276
shifts our mindset from

92
00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:34.975
AI coding to Agentic

93
00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.594
coding we'll then introduce

94
00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:38.574
the 12 leverage points

95
00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:40.175
of Agentic Coding and

96
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:41.495
then we'll discuss how

97
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.935
to measure your success

you're improving so we're

100
00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:46.935
betting on the software

101
00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:47.914
development life cycle as

102
00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:49.414
our framework for success

103
00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:50.634
now what's our lesson

104
00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:51.913
two tactic that will

drive how well you

106
00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:54.433
hand off work to

107
00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.033
your Agentic Coding tools

108
00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.653
throughout the software development

109
00:02:57.653 --> 00:02:59.421
life cycle adopt your

110
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:01.919
agent's perspective. This tactic
