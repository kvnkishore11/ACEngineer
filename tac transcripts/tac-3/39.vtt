874
00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:30.453
scale this up. Just

875
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:31.373
to kind of go

876
00:19:31.393 --> 00:19:32.432
over these key ideas

877
00:19:32.432 --> 00:19:33.672
again, we're putting to

878
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.290
work several leverage points

879
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.530
of agentic coding. We're

880
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.210
generating plans that's getting

881
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.088
created by templates, right?

882
00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:42.048
Reusable units of our

883
00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:44.106
engineering practices, right? We're

884
00:19:44.106 --> 00:19:45.845
teaching our agents how

885
00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:46.763
we want the work

886
00:19:46.763 --> 00:19:47.603
done, right? We're giving

887
00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:49.019
our agent our perspective

888
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.278
and in turn, we

889
00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:51.257
know what our agent's

890
00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.494
perspective is. We are

891
00:19:52.494 --> 00:19:54.092
enabling thinking mode, right?

892
00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:54.570
If you just search

893
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.789
for think, You'll be

894
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:56.509
able to find this.

895
00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:57.528
This is an information

896
00:19:57.528 --> 00:19:59.248
dense keyword that Anthropic

897
00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:01.247
has encoded into this
