00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:31.137
you communicate to your

11
00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:33.356
agentic tools and all

12
00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.875
generative AI technology. At

13
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.076
the heart of everything

14
00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.515
we're doing in TAC

15
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:39.634
is learning how to

16
00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:41.533
properly communicate to our

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.914
agents to get the

18
00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:45.975
work autonomously. Adopting your

19
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:47.814
agent's perspective is no

20
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.334
different than empathizing with

21
00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:50.353
a friend or a

22
00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:51.932
coworker. In order to

23
00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:53.591
understand them, connect with

24
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:55.810
them, and solve problems,

25
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.268
you must take their

26
00:00:57.268 --> 00:00:59.048
perspective. With AI coding

27
00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:00.466
and the big three,
