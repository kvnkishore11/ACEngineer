to encode custom templates,

1994
00:42:01.278 --> 00:42:02.239
right? These can be

1995
00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:04.338
anything chore bug feature.

1996
00:42:04.398 --> 00:42:05.318
These are just high

1997
00:42:05.318 --> 00:42:07.737
level generic units, generic

1998
00:42:07.757 --> 00:42:09.356
classes of engineering work.

1999
00:42:09.356 --> 00:42:10.076
But you can really

2000
00:42:10.076 --> 00:42:10.795
dial this in. If

2001
00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:11.255
you want to, you

2002
00:42:11.255 --> 00:42:12.175
can say this is

2003
00:42:12.175 --> 00:42:13.855
the front end feature

2004
00:42:13.855 --> 00:42:15.594
for these sets of

2005
00:42:15.594 --> 00:42:16.813
pages, right? Or these

2006
00:42:16.813 --> 00:42:18.193
sub pages on my

2007
00:42:18.193 --> 00:42:18.813
front end. Or you

2008
00:42:18.813 --> 00:42:20.072
can say, here's a

2009
00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:22.251
chore template for our

2010
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.210
database migration system. Or

2011
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.590
here's a bug resolver

2012
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.193
for our research notebook,

2013
00:42:28.193 --> 00:42:29.313
you know, system, whatever,

2014
00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.072
whatever it is, right?
