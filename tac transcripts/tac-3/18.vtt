363
00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:00.288
with proper Python logging.

364
00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:00.927
Let's go ahead and

365
00:09:00.927 --> 00:09:01.707
open that plan up.

366
00:09:01.768 --> 00:09:02.827
All plans are written

367
00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:04.466
to the specs directory.

368
00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:04.886
And so we can

369
00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:05.527
open this up and

370
00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:06.246
we see we have

371
00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.206
a brand new file.

372
00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:08.285
If we open this,

373
00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.033
and we go into

374
00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:10.113
preview mode here, we

375
00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:11.231
can see we have

376
00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:12.630
a chore written out

377
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.870
top to bottom. All

378
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.750
right, the chore of

379
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.269
course, replace server print

380
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:18.206
statements. There's the description.

381
00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:19.446
And here are all

382
00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:20.904
the relevant files to

383
00:09:20.904 --> 00:09:22.604
solve and complete this

384
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.702
work, server and main.

385
00:09:24.923 --> 00:09:26.360
Now we have step-by-step

386
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.059
tasks in our plan.

387
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.359
We then have step

388
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:30.697
four, run validation commands.
