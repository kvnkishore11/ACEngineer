27
00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:00.466
and the big three,

28
00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.545
context, model, and prompt,

29
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.304
you are able to

30
00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.162
push language models hard

31
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.042
and generate hundreds and

32
00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.400
thousands of lines of

33
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859
code. But AI coding

34
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.959
is not enough. Coding

35
00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.438
is just one element

36
00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.084
of engineering. There's a

37
00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:16.364
reason they're called Vibe

38
00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:18.623
Coders, not Vibe Engineers.

39
00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:20.063
They're just coding. We're

40
00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:21.081
doing it all. This

41
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.040
is real engineering. Agentic

42
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.200
Coding and the Core

43
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.879
4 takes it all

44
00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:27.299
to the next level

45
00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.198
with the addition of

46
00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.201
tools, our prompts, have
