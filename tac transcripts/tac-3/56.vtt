1279
00:27:59.726 --> 00:28:00.865
rest. So we can

1280
00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:01.663
see our agent is

1281
00:28:01.663 --> 00:28:03.840
still working here, 13.3K

1282
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.638
tokens running on whatever

1283
00:28:05.638 --> 00:28:06.597
the best model is.

1284
00:28:06.597 --> 00:28:07.957
So you're operating in

1285
00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:08.695
the future, whatever your

1286
00:28:08.695 --> 00:28:09.654
best model is, use

1287
00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:10.685
that. Make sure you

1288
00:28:10.746 --> 00:28:12.625
activate thinking mode to

1289
00:28:12.644 --> 00:28:13.604
throw more compute at

1290
00:28:13.604 --> 00:28:14.443
the problem. You want

1291
00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:15.803
your agent operating at

1292
00:28:15.803 --> 00:28:17.343
its highest efficiency mode

1293
00:28:17.403 --> 00:28:17.902
so you can hand

1294
00:28:17.902 --> 00:28:18.701
off the most work

1295
00:28:18.701 --> 00:28:19.622
possible. You want to

1296
00:28:19.622 --> 00:28:20.641
be leveraging your agent

1297
00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:22.599
to its maximum capability.

1298
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.220
And so there's something

1299
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.499
important to mention here.

1300
00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:25.318
You know, we can

1301
00:28:25.318 --> 00:28:26.397
continue to scale the

1302
00:28:26.397 --> 00:28:27.498
template and we can

1303
00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:28.957
continue to scale what

1304
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:29.896
you want to run

1305
00:28:29.977 --> 00:28:31.316
inside of your higher
