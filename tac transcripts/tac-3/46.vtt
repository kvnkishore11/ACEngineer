1054
00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:00.578
mode. And then it's

1055
00:23:00.578 --> 00:23:01.078
going to write a

1056
00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:02.018
great report for us.

1057
00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:03.336
So let me explain.

1058
00:23:03.497 --> 00:23:04.276
Why do I keep

1059
00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:05.914
opening up new cloud

1060
00:23:05.974 --> 00:23:07.445
code instances? You know,

1061
00:23:07.445 --> 00:23:08.005
look at all these

1062
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:09.324
terminals. I keep opening

1063
00:23:09.324 --> 00:23:10.243
new terminals and starting

1064
00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:11.903
fresh agent instances that

1065
00:23:11.903 --> 00:23:12.922
have no memory of

1066
00:23:12.922 --> 00:23:14.141
what just happened. Why

1067
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:14.820
am I doing that?

1068
00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:15.440
Don't we want to

1069
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.979
keep rolling the important

1070
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.237
context between planning, building,

1071
00:23:19.237 --> 00:23:20.537
and really the entire

1072
00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:22.335
software development lifecycle? No.

1073
00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:23.653
And there are three

1074
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:24.893
important reasons we don't

1075
00:23:24.893 --> 00:23:27.511
want agents stretched across

1076
00:23:27.592 --> 00:23:29.111
the software development lifecycle.

1077
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.028
By running fresh agents
