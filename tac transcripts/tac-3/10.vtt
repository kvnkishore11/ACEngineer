00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:00.673
comes next, these tools

180
00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:01.612
are great, but they're

181
00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:03.271
limited by nature. No

182
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:04.552
matter how great AI

183
00:05:04.552 --> 00:05:06.589
gets, they don't understand

184
00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:07.930
your codebase like

185
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.908
you do. And out

186
00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:09.947
of the box, they

187
00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:11.146
don't let you control

188
00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:12.307
your agents to the

189
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:14.384
granularity you need to

190
00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.043
to ship code end

191
00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:17.343
to end throughout the

192
00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:19.362
software development lifecycle. So

193
00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:20.701
how can templates let

194
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:22.220
us encode our engineering

195
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.819
and hand off massive

196
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.798
amounts of work to

197
00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:27.057
our agents through plans?

198
00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:28.115
Let's break it down

199
00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:29.954
in the TAC3 code

200
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:30.875
base. Let's go ahead
