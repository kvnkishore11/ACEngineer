at line 23, 24,

1790
00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:02.032
right? So this is

1791
00:38:02.172 --> 00:38:03.351
really powerful. Our agent

1792
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.208
is running, right? This

1793
00:38:05.228 --> 00:38:06.608
slash feature, right? And

1794
00:38:06.608 --> 00:38:07.766
we know that if

1795
00:38:07.766 --> 00:38:08.425
we open this up

1796
00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:10.125
dot cloud commands feature,

1797
00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:11.204
it's doing this, right?

1798
00:38:11.204 --> 00:38:12.302
It is generating a

1799
00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:13.202
plan, right? You can

1800
00:38:13.202 --> 00:38:14.141
always read the purpose

1801
00:38:14.141 --> 00:38:14.641
right at the top

1802
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:15.599
of the prompt, generate

1803
00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:16.719
a new plan in

1804
00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:19.036
specs.md to implement feature

1805
00:38:19.257 --> 00:38:20.255
using the specified plan

1806
00:38:20.255 --> 00:38:21.635
format, follow the instructions

1807
00:38:21.635 --> 00:38:22.653
to create the plan.

1808
00:38:22.818 --> 00:38:24.097
use the relevant files,

1809
00:38:24.117 --> 00:38:24.536
right? And then we're

1810
00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:25.916
breaking it down. Whatever

1811
00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:28.494
detail this templated piece

1812
00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:29.893
of your engineering needs,
