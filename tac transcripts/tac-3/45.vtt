1026
00:22:29.968 --> 00:22:31.346
go ahead and actually

1027
00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:33.105
commit these solutions, right?

1028
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:34.565
Commit my specs and

1029
00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:35.505
the code changes into

1030
00:22:35.505 --> 00:22:36.124
the codebase. I

1031
00:22:36.124 --> 00:22:36.743
have a quick command

1032
00:22:36.743 --> 00:22:37.843
for that. I'm going

1033
00:22:37.843 --> 00:22:38.202
to go ahead and

1034
00:22:38.202 --> 00:22:39.241
commit that and then

1035
00:22:39.241 --> 00:22:40.634
kick this off. And

1036
00:22:40.634 --> 00:22:41.653
we'll talk about how

1037
00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:42.672
to use Git in

1038
00:22:42.672 --> 00:22:44.451
these systems. TLDR there

1039
00:22:44.451 --> 00:22:45.170
is you want each

1040
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.009
one of these steps

1041
00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:47.088
to commit their changes.

1042
00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:47.988
More details on that

1043
00:22:47.988 --> 00:22:49.346
in upcoming lessons. Our

1044
00:22:49.346 --> 00:22:49.807
agent is going to

1045
00:22:49.807 --> 00:22:50.426
solve this for us

1046
00:22:50.426 --> 00:22:51.705
now, right? Same deal.

1047
00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:53.005
There's all the steps.

1048
00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:53.983
It's read the plan.

1049
00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:54.962
It knows that it's

1050
00:22:54.962 --> 00:22:56.402
running the implement. So

1051
00:22:56.402 --> 00:22:56.981
it's going to run

1052
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.039
in, right? In thinking

1053
00:22:59.039 --> 00:22:59.838
mode with the reasoning

1054
00:22:59.838 --> 00:23:00.578
mode. And then it's
