605
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.809
logging plan. And let's

606
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.129
go ahead and decollaps

607
00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:03.187
this. This is super

608
00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:04.567
powerful. We have plans

609
00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:06.245
getting passed into plans.

610
00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:06.966
You can see our

611
00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:07.985
agent is working through

612
00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:08.923
the steps. You know,

613
00:14:08.964 --> 00:14:09.844
you'll notice something very

614
00:14:09.844 --> 00:14:11.342
powerful here. We're tapping

615
00:14:11.342 --> 00:14:13.240
into our agents capabilities.

616
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.100
You can line up

617
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.480
the to do list

618
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.639
that was created here

619
00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:19.446
with our step-by-step breakdown.

620
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.249
Okay, so we're leveraging

621
00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:22.489
our plan. We're aligning

622
00:14:22.489 --> 00:14:23.788
it with the capabilities

623
00:14:23.788 --> 00:14:24.727
of our agent. We

624
00:14:24.727 --> 00:14:25.746
are betting big on

625
00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:26.966
Claude Code as the

626
00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.306
best Agentic Coding tool,

627
00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:29.365
but this will change

628
00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:30.345
over time, right? We
