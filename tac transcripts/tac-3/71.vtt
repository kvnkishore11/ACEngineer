1661
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:30.574
all here for us,

1662
00:35:30.574 --> 00:35:31.333
right? So let me

1663
00:35:31.333 --> 00:35:31.853
show you one more

1664
00:35:31.853 --> 00:35:33.471
thing here. This encapsulates

1665
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.650
everything we've done here

1666
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.949
and showcases it to

1667
00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:36.987
what's coming next. So

1668
00:35:37.327 --> 00:35:38.306
we have this feature,

1669
00:35:38.306 --> 00:35:39.750
right, slash feature. We

1670
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.590
of course write our

1671
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.070
prompt and slash feature

1672
00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.429
is another template. That's

1673
00:35:43.429 --> 00:35:44.728
also a meta prompt,

1674
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:45.389
write a prompt that

1675
00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:46.429
creates a prompt. We

1676
00:35:46.429 --> 00:35:47.889
have the structure here

1677
00:35:48.009 --> 00:35:49.909
specifically built out for

1678
00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:52.027
creating new features, right?

1679
00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:53.568
Net new features. This

1680
00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:55.688
is very differentiated from,

1681
00:35:55.867 --> 00:35:57.847
you know, generating bugs

1682
00:35:57.847 --> 00:35:59.547
or chores, right? These

1683
00:35:59.547 --> 00:36:00.527
are not the same
