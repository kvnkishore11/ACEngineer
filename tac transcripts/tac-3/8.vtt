149
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:00.838
adopting your agent's perspective

150
00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:02.157
you close the gap

151
00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:03.397
between what you can

152
00:04:03.397 --> 00:04:04.385
do and what your

153
00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:05.905
agent can do. Only

154
00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:06.805
by doing this will

155
00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:07.644
you make a key

156
00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:09.743
transition into high leverage

157
00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:11.203
Agentic Coding where it's

158
00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:12.323
not about what you

159
00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:13.481
can do anymore. It's

160
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.141
about what you can

161
00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:15.600
teach your agents to

162
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.281
do. I hope you

163
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:17.341
can see how important

164
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:18.860
this tactic is for

165
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.559
Agentic Coding. Now that

166
00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.298
brings us to an

167
00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:22.997
important question. How can

168
00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:24.038
you give your agent

169
00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:25.617
everything it needs to

170
00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:27.016
succeed. We do this

171
00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.456
by using the 12

172
00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.355
leverage points of agentic
