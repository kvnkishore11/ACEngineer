00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:01.247
has encoded into this

898
00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:02.606
word here. Think. And

899
00:20:02.606 --> 00:20:02.846
so you can see

900
00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:04.165
the model thinking. We,

901
00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:04.746
of course, have a

902
00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.845
core four at work.

903
00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:06.625
None of this works

904
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:07.503
without the core four

905
00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:08.983
are in agent leverage

906
00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:09.843
points. And we, of

907
00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:11.343
course, have a well-designed

908
00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.142
codebase. It's a

909
00:20:12.142 --> 00:20:14.141
simple structure, right? Client

910
00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:15.300
server. It's very easy

911
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.480
for agent to understand

912
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.079
where everything is located.

913
00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:18.818
We're not doing anything

914
00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:20.417
tricky or fancy or

915
00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:22.737
unusual here. Pretty straightforward

916
00:20:22.737 --> 00:20:23.936
codebases, right? And

917
00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:24.257
then we have a

918
00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:25.615
little bit of documentation

919
00:20:25.655 --> 00:20:27.214
in the readme detailing

920
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:28.233
our structure, how to

921
00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:29.074
set things up, so

922
00:20:29.074 --> 00:20:29.792
on and so forth.

923
00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:30.652
And so we can
