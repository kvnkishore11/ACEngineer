704
00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:00.038
this if we want

705
00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:01.277
to. I am very,

706
00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:02.157
very confident that this

707
00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:03.136
is working, but you

708
00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:03.775
know, it's always good

709
00:16:03.775 --> 00:16:04.995
to manually test. So

710
00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:05.615
we can go ahead,

711
00:16:05.696 --> 00:16:06.514
kick off our server

712
00:16:06.514 --> 00:16:07.875
again, open up the

713
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:09.533
browser, do a refresh,

714
00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:10.046
And so we can

715
00:16:10.046 --> 00:16:11.004
see that info log

716
00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:11.725
right there. That looks

717
00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:12.844
great. Let's go ahead

718
00:16:12.844 --> 00:16:13.623
and run that same

719
00:16:13.623 --> 00:16:14.602
query. So let's get

720
00:16:14.763 --> 00:16:17.461
users ID name sorted

721
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:19.340
by signup date descending.

722
00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:20.499
So there we go.

723
00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:21.479
We got that sorted

724
00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:22.697
by signup date descending.

725
00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:23.136
And if we go

726
00:16:23.136 --> 00:16:24.356
back, we can see

727
00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:25.556
that we have our

728
00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:27.695
success query processed in

729
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.452
that new logging format

730
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.152
with the logs exactly
