110
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:01.919
agent's perspective. This tactic

111
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.459
is critical for high

112
00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.497
leverage Agentic Coding. Why

113
00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:06.638
is that? Your agent

114
00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.116
is brilliant, but blind.

115
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:09.836
With every new session,

116
00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:10.875
it starts as a

117
00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.973
blank instance. Agents are

118
00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.013
ephemeral, no context, no

119
00:03:15.013 --> 00:03:16.651
memories, and no awareness

120
00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:17.570
outside of what you

121
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.411
give it. And when

122
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:19.030
all the work is

123
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.949
done, it resets back

124
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.008
to zero. If you

125
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:22.848
want your agent to

126
00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:24.227
perform like you would

127
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.045
across your codebase,

128
00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.671
agentically, it needs your

129
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:30.491
perspective. Your agent needs
