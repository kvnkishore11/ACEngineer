64
00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:00.453
full circle great prompting

65
00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:02.331
is all about communicating

66
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.852
to gen ai and

67
00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:05.412
planning is how we

68
00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:06.552
do this better than

69
00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:07.751
the rest in lesson

70
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:08.931
three we're going to

71
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.371
scale your prompts into

72
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.091
plans and scale your

73
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.471
plans into something even

74
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:15.949
more powerful to drive

75
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.689
a massive impact we'll

76
00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.949
do this by using

77
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.770
a new game breaking

78
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.468
tactic. Once you see

79
00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:23.649
this tactic and the

80
00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.109
implementations of it, it

81
00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.528
will be impossible to

82
00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:28.368
unsee. You'll understand how

83
00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:29.867
a few engineers are

84
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:31.707
changing the engineering game
