579
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.240
can see as an

580
00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.019
argument we're passing in

581
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:32.958
the plan. This is

582
00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.918
a higher order prompt,

583
00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:36.878
AKA a hop. Okay.

584
00:13:37.177 --> 00:13:37.677
There are a lot

585
00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:39.017
of advanced concepts here.

586
00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:39.897
We'll circle back to

587
00:13:39.897 --> 00:13:40.696
the higher order prompt

588
00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:41.416
in a moment. But

589
00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:42.375
basically what we need

590
00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:43.155
to know here is

591
00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.034
that thanks to this

592
00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:44.654
prompt, if we hit

593
00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:45.894
up here, implement and

594
00:13:45.894 --> 00:13:46.475
then we pass in

595
00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:47.433
the plan that we

596
00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:48.918
want implemented, This is

597
00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:50.796
going to pass our

598
00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:51.895
file path here. And

599
00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:52.934
then our instructions, of

600
00:13:52.934 --> 00:13:54.553
course, said read, think

601
00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:55.993
hard and then execute.

602
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:57.192
Okay. And so this

603
00:13:57.192 --> 00:13:57.951
is going to run

604
00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:59.690
the replace print with

605
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.809
logging plan. And let's
