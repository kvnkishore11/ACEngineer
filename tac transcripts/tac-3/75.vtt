1762
00:37:29.536 --> 00:37:30.496
into the planning phase,

1763
00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:30.976
but we can do

1764
00:37:30.976 --> 00:37:32.315
that of across the

1765
00:37:32.315 --> 00:37:33.894
software development lifecycle to

1766
00:37:33.894 --> 00:37:34.514
turn it into the

1767
00:37:34.534 --> 00:37:36.932
agentic software development lifecycle

1768
00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:37.713
so that our agents

1769
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:38.632
are operating this for

1770
00:37:38.632 --> 00:37:39.632
us. So we are

1771
00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:40.990
streaming this output. So

1772
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.530
if we open up

1773
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.389
the sidebar here, you

1774
00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:44.090
can see we have

1775
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:44.869
a new JSONL file.

1776
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:46.367
Let's click that and

1777
00:37:46.367 --> 00:37:47.188
check this out. Our

1778
00:37:47.188 --> 00:37:48.847
agent is actively working

1779
00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:49.827
right now and we're

1780
00:37:49.827 --> 00:37:51.346
getting the result reported.

1781
00:37:51.525 --> 00:37:51.905
All right. So this

1782
00:37:51.905 --> 00:37:52.844
is this is live,

1783
00:37:52.844 --> 00:37:53.684
right? If I swap

1784
00:37:53.684 --> 00:37:55.023
files here, you can

1785
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:56.143
see that this is

1786
00:37:56.282 --> 00:37:57.603
slowly getting appended. All

1787
00:37:57.603 --> 00:37:58.121
right. So this is

1788
00:37:58.121 --> 00:37:59.693
line 22. Now we're

1789
00:37:59.693 --> 00:38:01.311
at line 23, 24,
