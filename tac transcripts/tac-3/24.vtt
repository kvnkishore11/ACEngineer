505
00:11:59.773 --> 00:12:01.533
reference in our purpose.

506
00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:02.292
So this is super

507
00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:03.052
powerful. I hope you

508
00:12:03.052 --> 00:12:03.871
can see where this

509
00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:04.850
can go. This is

510
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.250
a massive, massive idea,

511
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.250
but we're not done

512
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.970
yet, right? We only

513
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.590
generated a plan. Okay.

514
00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:10.889
It's just an auxiliary

515
00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:11.948
document. Let's go ahead

516
00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:13.389
and implement the work

517
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:14.888
detailed in our replace

518
00:12:14.888 --> 00:12:16.506
print with logging plan.

519
00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:17.427
So let's go ahead

520
00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:18.386
and open a new

521
00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:20.025
terminal and boot up

522
00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.765
another claw code instance.

523
00:12:21.904 --> 00:12:22.565
This might seem like

524
00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:23.745
a weird pattern, but

525
00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:25.004
it's ultra important. We'll

526
00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:26.323
discuss why later. Let's

527
00:12:26.323 --> 00:12:28.623
run another simple slash

528
00:12:28.643 --> 00:12:29.623
command to kick off

529
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:30.621
this plan. We're going
