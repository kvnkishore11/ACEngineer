side panel, great description,

2040
00:43:01.204 --> 00:43:03.503
user story, problem solution

2041
00:43:03.503 --> 00:43:05.262
statement, relevant files. Check

2042
00:43:05.262 --> 00:43:06.222
this out. We have

2043
00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:08.702
encoded the planning phase

2044
00:43:08.802 --> 00:43:10.942
for creating features for

2045
00:43:10.942 --> 00:43:11.702
our codebase. It's

2046
00:43:11.802 --> 00:43:13.121
all here. We can

2047
00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:14.041
now pass this off

2048
00:43:14.101 --> 00:43:15.400
to the code step

2049
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:16.260
in the software development

2050
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.019
lifecycle and have an

2051
00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:18.259
agent implement this, right?

2052
00:43:18.318 --> 00:43:19.998
Implementation plan, foundation, core,

2053
00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:22.295
integration, steps, right? So

2054
00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:23.115
here it is. We're

2055
00:43:23.115 --> 00:43:24.994
templating our success. Bam,

2056
00:43:25.054 --> 00:43:25.594
bam, bam. Look at

2057
00:43:25.594 --> 00:43:26.733
all these great steps.

2058
00:43:26.934 --> 00:43:28.052
Top to bottom, final

2059
00:43:28.052 --> 00:43:30.092
polish, testing, integration, edge
