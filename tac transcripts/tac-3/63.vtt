1445
00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:31.636
off-device Agentic Coding. Let

1446
00:31:31.636 --> 00:31:32.076
me just show you

1447
00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:33.576
one more example of

1448
00:31:33.576 --> 00:31:35.135
that. Our bug is

1449
00:31:35.135 --> 00:31:36.275
still getting smashed here.

1450
00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:36.694
We're going to let

1451
00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:37.595
this run. And then

1452
00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:38.734
of course we'll validate

1453
00:31:38.734 --> 00:31:39.693
the work at the

1454
00:31:39.693 --> 00:31:41.054
end. We're moving toward

1455
00:31:41.153 --> 00:31:42.192
Automating the full software

1456
00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:43.670
development lifecycle. So how

1457
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.489
will we build features

1458
00:31:44.489 --> 00:31:45.428
end to end? Do

1459
00:31:45.428 --> 00:31:46.386
we, the engineer, sit

1460
00:31:46.386 --> 00:31:47.644
down and type code?

1461
00:31:47.763 --> 00:31:48.324
We know that that's

1462
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.182
not the case, right?

1463
00:31:49.182 --> 00:31:49.662
We're going to stop

1464
00:31:49.662 --> 00:31:50.500
coding. We don't even

1465
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.239
want to type the

1466
00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:53.269
plan ourselves. Can leverage

1467
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:54.210
agentics to look through

1468
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:54.849
our codebase to

1469
00:31:54.849 --> 00:31:55.828
help us plan and

1470
00:31:55.828 --> 00:31:56.229
then we can of

1471
00:31:56.229 --> 00:31:57.189
course you know review

1472
00:31:57.189 --> 00:31:58.409
the plans review our

1473
00:31:58.409 --> 00:31:59.409
templates that generate the

1474
00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:00.229
plan so how are
