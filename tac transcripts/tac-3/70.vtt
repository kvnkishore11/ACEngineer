1635
00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.222
our templates. It's acknowledging

1636
00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:02.722
and running the self

1637
00:35:02.722 --> 00:35:04.373
validation steps to close

1638
00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:04.992
the loop. This is

1639
00:35:04.992 --> 00:35:05.811
a big idea. Huge,

1640
00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:07.568
huge leverage point of

1641
00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:08.527
Agentic Coding. We're going

1642
00:35:08.527 --> 00:35:09.166
to talk about it

1643
00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:10.083
has its own dedicated

1644
00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:11.163
lesson because this idea

1645
00:35:11.163 --> 00:35:12.521
is so important that

1646
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:13.079
you can see here.

1647
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:13.719
We're just doing that

1648
00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:16.074
here. Update documentation, conference

1649
00:35:16.074 --> 00:35:17.186
of tests, It's all

1650
00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:17.844
here. It's all in

1651
00:35:17.844 --> 00:35:19.364
the plan. It's all

1652
00:35:19.364 --> 00:35:21.262
easily reproducible. If we

1653
00:35:21.262 --> 00:35:22.001
wanted to tweak the

1654
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:23.340
plan, we could. If

1655
00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.099
we wanted to tweak

1656
00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:25.277
the higher order prompt,

1657
00:35:25.418 --> 00:35:25.918
if we wanted to

1658
00:35:25.918 --> 00:35:27.516
tweak the template that

1659
00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:28.675
generates the plan, we

1660
00:35:28.675 --> 00:35:29.833
totally could. But it's

1661
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:30.574
all here for us,
