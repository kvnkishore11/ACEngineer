1532
00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.008
We're gonna run slash

1533
00:33:01.008 --> 00:33:02.269
feature. I'm going to

1534
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.630
kick this off. I

1535
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.288
want to show you

1536
00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:04.628
where this is all

1537
00:33:04.628 --> 00:33:05.688
going. We're starting to

1538
00:33:05.688 --> 00:33:07.468
scale up our compositions

1539
00:33:07.488 --> 00:33:08.787
of agentic coding so

1540
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:09.606
that we can run

1541
00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:11.346
across the entire software

1542
00:33:11.346 --> 00:33:12.546
development lifecycle. That's why

1543
00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:13.444
this is so important.

1544
00:33:13.565 --> 00:33:13.964
We need to be

1545
00:33:13.964 --> 00:33:14.964
able to run this

1546
00:33:15.005 --> 00:33:16.304
autonomously. We need to

1547
00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:16.844
be able to run

1548
00:33:16.844 --> 00:33:19.083
this without our presence.

1549
00:33:19.143 --> 00:33:19.603
This is why it's

1550
00:33:19.603 --> 00:33:20.541
called the presence KPI.

1551
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.122
We want to create

1552
00:33:22.162 --> 00:33:23.721
a new query history

1553
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.640
side panel in the

1554
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.140
app. All completed queries

1555
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.098
store in the database

1556
00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:31.038
names for each query.
