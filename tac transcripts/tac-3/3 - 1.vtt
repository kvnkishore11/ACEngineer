46
00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.201
tools, our prompts, have

47
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.921
become exponentially more powerful.

48
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:34.320
Prompting is how we

49
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.680
enable this. In order

50
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.740
to maximize this ability,

51
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.739
we need to scale

52
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.239
our prompts. Here's a

53
00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.620
simple question for you.

54
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.058
What does a scaled

55
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.679
prompt look like? You

56
00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:46.498
guessed it. It's a

57
00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:48.379
plan. It's a specification.

58
00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:50.337
It's a PRD. Plans

59
00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.158
are prompts scaled up

60
00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:54.153
for high impact the

61
00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:55.653
plan is the prompt

62
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.072
and that means great

63
00:01:57.072 --> 00:01:58.753
planning is great prompting

64
00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:00.453
full circle great prompting
