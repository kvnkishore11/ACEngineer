1841
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.239
of this, right? You

1842
00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:01.340
can imagine this command

1843
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.539
is running on any

1844
00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.239
machine anywhere, right? It

1845
00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:05.018
was kicked off in

1846
00:39:05.018 --> 00:39:06.278
some way, somehow, and

1847
00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:07.119
this is doing engineering

1848
00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:07.619
work is going to

1849
00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:08.418
generate a plan for

1850
00:39:08.418 --> 00:39:09.159
us. And you can

1851
00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:10.557
imagine we can chain

1852
00:39:10.717 --> 00:39:12.057
these agents together. We

1853
00:39:12.057 --> 00:39:13.630
can check, their output,

1854
00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:14.349
we can do a

1855
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:15.648
lot with this. All

1856
00:39:15.648 --> 00:39:16.668
right, we're just building

1857
00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.108
up the fundamentals. We're

1858
00:39:18.108 --> 00:39:19.307
getting to this intermediate

1859
00:39:19.307 --> 00:39:20.088
zone where we can

1860
00:39:20.088 --> 00:39:21.646
really ship a ton

1861
00:39:21.646 --> 00:39:23.666
of value autonomously by

1862
00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:25.525
doing the work Right.

1863
00:39:25.606 --> 00:39:27.025
Prompting back and forth

1864
00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:28.284
inside of a terminal,

1865
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:28.983
right? Back and forth

1866
00:39:28.983 --> 00:39:29.463
and back and forth

1867
00:39:29.463 --> 00:39:30.143
and back and forth.
