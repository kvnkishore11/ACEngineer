529
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:30.621
this plan. We're going

530
00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:32.062
to run slash implement.

531
00:12:32.706 --> 00:12:33.145
and then we're going

532
00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:33.725
to get the file

533
00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:34.664
path to the plan

534
00:12:34.664 --> 00:12:35.144
we created. So I'm

535
00:12:35.144 --> 00:12:35.865
just going to copy

536
00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:36.884
that and paste it

537
00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:37.965
here and that's it.

538
00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:38.764
We're going to fire

539
00:12:38.764 --> 00:12:39.703
this off. It doesn't

540
00:12:39.783 --> 00:12:40.644
take a lot to

541
00:12:40.644 --> 00:12:41.283
do a lot, but

542
00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:41.942
you need the right

543
00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:43.523
information. Our agent is

544
00:12:43.523 --> 00:12:44.383
getting to work here.

545
00:12:44.403 --> 00:12:44.962
Let's go ahead and

546
00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:46.621
crack open the implement

547
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:48.001
prompt to understand what's

548
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:48.381
going on. So we

549
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:49.681
have another reusable prompt

550
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:51.400
here, implement and check

551
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.461
this out, right? Very

552
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:54.519
simple, very concise, 12

553
00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.519
lines of natural language.

554
00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:57.139
We have the purpose

555
00:12:57.139 --> 00:12:58.298
at the top, follow

556
00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:00.038
the instructions to implement
