628
00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:30.345
over time, right? We

629
00:14:30.345 --> 00:14:31.125
want to focus on

630
00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:31.943
tactics. We want to

631
00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.543
focus on capabilities. We

632
00:14:33.682 --> 00:14:34.582
want to focus on

633
00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:35.462
what the tools can

634
00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:36.142
do for us. Of

635
00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:37.302
course, we're using cloud

636
00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:38.500
code. We're big fans.

637
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620
But the key here

638
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.820
is the capabilities that

639
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.899
are unlocked by the

640
00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:43.318
tool. Okay. And then

641
00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:44.139
very importantly, if we

642
00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:44.758
go back to the

643
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:45.898
implement, you can see

644
00:14:45.898 --> 00:14:47.017
we have this report

645
00:14:47.076 --> 00:14:48.655
block right under our

646
00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:50.255
plan summarized work and

647
00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:51.855
then report files change.

648
00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:52.673
And you can see

649
00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:54.432
this happening exactly. And

650
00:14:54.432 --> 00:14:54.893
this is going to

651
00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.392
be super, super important

652
00:14:56.672 --> 00:14:57.671
once we really start

653
00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:59.090
getting into true off

654
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.068
device agentic coding. Okay.
