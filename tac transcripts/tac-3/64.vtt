1474
00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:00.229
plan so how are

1475
00:32:00.229 --> 00:32:00.588
we going to do

1476
00:32:00.588 --> 00:32:01.608
this end to end

1477
00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:02.067
we won't be able

1478
00:32:02.067 --> 00:32:02.607
to open up the

1479
00:32:02.607 --> 00:32:04.028
terminal we need a

1480
00:32:04.028 --> 00:32:05.327
key feature that we've

1481
00:32:05.327 --> 00:32:07.948
discussed that really differentiates

1482
00:32:07.948 --> 00:32:08.626
agentic coding so we

1483
00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:09.646
want to build features

1484
00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:10.567
end to end we

1485
00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:11.346
need a feature that

1486
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:12.326
lets us run our

1487
00:32:12.326 --> 00:32:14.007
agents without us being

1488
00:32:14.027 --> 00:32:14.905
there and in order

1489
00:32:14.905 --> 00:32:15.486
to do that that

1490
00:32:15.486 --> 00:32:16.286
means we need to

1491
00:32:16.286 --> 00:32:17.006
be able to run

1492
00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:18.417
our agent right in

1493
00:32:18.417 --> 00:32:19.536
the terminal because we

1494
00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:20.455
can access the terminal

1495
00:32:20.455 --> 00:32:21.933
anywhere right local environments

1496
00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:22.813
cloud environments so on

1497
00:32:22.813 --> 00:32:23.832
and so forth there's

1498
00:32:23.832 --> 00:32:24.531
going to be a

1499
00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:25.611
big hot topic in

1500
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:26.630
our next lesson I

1501
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.128
just want to show

1502
00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:28.248
you the beginning of

1503
00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.307
this right here so

1504
00:32:29.307 --> 00:32:29.767
I'm going to open

1505
00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:30.465
up a new file
