296
00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:30.708
template and understand the

297
00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:31.908
impact it has on

298
00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:33.706
your agentic coding abilities.

299
00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:35.204
So let's open up

300
00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:36.324
a brand new cloud

301
00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.684
code instance here, and

302
00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:38.382
we're going to trigger

303
00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:40.221
a template called slash

304
00:07:40.706 --> 00:07:41.886
chore and inside of

305
00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:43.266
this template it accepts

306
00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:44.725
a parameter so i'll

307
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:47.245
type replace all server

308
00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:48.985
print statements proper python

309
00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.124
logging log levels make

310
00:07:51.124 --> 00:07:52.783
sure all output is

311
00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:54.504
written to standard out

312
00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:56.463
all right let's fire

313
00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:57.923
this off here we're

314
00:07:57.923 --> 00:07:59.862
running a special custom

315
00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:01.182
slash command that produces
