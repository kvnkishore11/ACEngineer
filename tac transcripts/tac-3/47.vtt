1077
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.028
By running fresh agents

1078
00:23:31.088 --> 00:23:32.188
over and over, we

1079
00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:33.586
do a few things.

1080
00:23:33.707 --> 00:23:34.666
We free up our

1081
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:37.390
context. Focus every available

1082
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.750
token on the task

1083
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:39.929
at hand this is

1084
00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:41.288
important for large code

1085
00:23:41.288 --> 00:23:42.548
bases and for long

1086
00:23:42.548 --> 00:23:43.949
running tasks when we

1087
00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:45.189
use one agent for

1088
00:23:45.189 --> 00:23:46.508
one task we allow

1089
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:47.708
it to focus its

1090
00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:49.127
context window on one

1091
00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:50.387
mission this should sound

1092
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.167
familiar for any engineer

1093
00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:53.248
that's been overloaded right

1094
00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:54.987
we as humans we

1095
00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:56.326
also have context windows

1096
00:23:56.326 --> 00:23:56.946
we can only do

1097
00:23:56.946 --> 00:23:57.767
so much and the

1098
00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.007
more we focus the

1099
00:23:59.007 --> 00:24:00.346
better the result okay
