2087
00:43:59.257 --> 00:44:00.177
and just do something

2088
00:44:00.177 --> 00:44:01.536
small. Don't wait to

2089
00:44:01.536 --> 00:44:02.615
complete this course. You'll

2090
00:44:02.615 --> 00:44:03.675
miss out on getting

2091
00:44:03.675 --> 00:44:04.795
ahead now. All right.

2092
00:44:04.815 --> 00:44:05.733
This lesson will get

2093
00:44:05.733 --> 00:44:06.634
you to your first

2094
00:44:06.773 --> 00:44:08.273
aha moment. Don't make

2095
00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:09.512
the mistake of thinking

2096
00:44:09.512 --> 00:44:10.411
that this is not

2097
00:44:10.411 --> 00:44:11.251
going to work for

2098
00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:12.208
your system, for your

2099
00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:13.347
codebase. Maybe you

2100
00:44:13.347 --> 00:44:13.925
think your codebase

2101
00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:15.143
is too large, yada,

2102
00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:16.182
yada, yada. Be very

2103
00:44:16.182 --> 00:44:17.141
careful thinking that these

2104
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:18.659
tactics can't work for

2105
00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:19.670
you. And on your

2106
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.748
codebase that that

2107
00:44:20.748 --> 00:44:21.887
is a limiting belief.

2108
00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:23.447
Okay. Models will improve

2109
00:44:23.586 --> 00:44:24.806
tools will change. These

2110
00:44:24.806 --> 00:44:26.764
tactics are ultra ultra

2111
00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.844
useful. I could not

2112
00:44:27.844 --> 00:44:29.242
have created Tactical Agent

2113
00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:30.842
Agentic Coding without all of
