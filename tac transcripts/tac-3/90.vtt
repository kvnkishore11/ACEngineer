2136
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.639
agentic engineer. So what's

2137
00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:02.759
next in our next

2138
00:45:02.759 --> 00:45:04.177
lesson in lesson four.

2139
00:45:04.481 --> 00:45:06.338
We lean into programmatic

2140
00:45:06.338 --> 00:45:07.695
agents. We lean in

2141
00:45:07.695 --> 00:45:09.911
to true off-device Agentic

2142
00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:10.949
coding. In order to

2143
00:45:10.949 --> 00:45:11.788
do this, we need

2144
00:45:11.788 --> 00:45:12.367
to learn how to

2145
00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:13.804
trigger our agents and

2146
00:45:13.804 --> 00:45:14.523
let them run in

2147
00:45:14.523 --> 00:45:16.572
their own environments. We'll

2148
00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:17.393
do this by tapping

2149
00:45:17.393 --> 00:45:19.172
into the highest composition

2150
00:45:19.172 --> 00:45:20.391
level and the greatest

2151
00:45:20.391 --> 00:45:21.530
leverage point of agentic

2152
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.949
coding, AI developer workflows.

2153
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.730
Once you start to

2154
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.648
understand all the ways

2155
00:45:26.648 --> 00:45:27.768
your agent can operate

2156
00:45:27.768 --> 00:45:29.327
alongside you and how

2157
00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:31.086
to improve them, not
