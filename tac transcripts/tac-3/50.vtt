1146
00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:00.795
bugs, then you can

1147
00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:02.614
specialize your bug, right?

1148
00:25:02.614 --> 00:25:03.213
And this is a

1149
00:25:03.213 --> 00:25:05.192
huge, huge solution for

1150
00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:06.412
big codebases. The

1151
00:25:06.412 --> 00:25:07.631
more code, the more

1152
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.690
complexity in your code

1153
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.609
base, the more you'll

1154
00:25:09.609 --> 00:25:10.709
want to dial in

1155
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:12.268
your reusable templates to

1156
00:25:12.268 --> 00:25:14.086
solve specific problems really

1157
00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:15.645
well, okay? And there

1158
00:25:15.645 --> 00:25:16.144
are a bunch of

1159
00:25:16.144 --> 00:25:16.805
tricks we can layer

1160
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:17.723
on here. There are

1161
00:25:17.723 --> 00:25:19.222
parallel agents. You can

1162
00:25:19.222 --> 00:25:19.982
delegate a lot of

1163
00:25:19.982 --> 00:25:21.021
work. You can use

1164
00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:22.969
isolated sub agent context

1165
00:25:22.969 --> 00:25:23.949
windows. There's a lot

1166
00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:25.169
of fancy tricks to

1167
00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:26.607
handling large codebases.

1168
00:25:26.607 --> 00:25:27.407
And so let's refocus

1169
00:25:27.407 --> 00:25:28.307
on the last point.

1170
00:25:28.307 --> 00:25:29.207
Number one, we free

1171
00:25:29.207 --> 00:25:30.186
up our context window.
