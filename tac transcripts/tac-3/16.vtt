00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:01.182
slash command that produces

316
00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:02.843
a unique outcome this

317
00:08:02.843 --> 00:08:04.322
is a template and

318
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.762
a meta prompt what

319
00:08:05.762 --> 00:08:06.622
is a meta prompt

320
00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:07.761
It's a prompt that

321
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:08.980
builds a prompt. More

322
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.317
specifically, this agentic prompt

323
00:08:11.437 --> 00:08:12.975
builds a plan based

324
00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:14.353
on a template that

325
00:08:14.353 --> 00:08:15.752
our agent fills out.

326
00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:16.930
Let's monitor the results

327
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.910
here and we'll break

328
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.908
down the contents of

329
00:08:18.908 --> 00:08:20.288
this unique agentic prompt.

330
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:21.346
You can see our

331
00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:22.384
agent is looking through

332
00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:23.363
our codebase. It's

333
00:08:23.384 --> 00:08:25.182
also using its reasoning

334
00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:26.286
model. And so it's

335
00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:26.805
searching through the code

336
00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:28.463
base, it's gathering context

337
00:08:28.463 --> 00:08:29.682
for this tour. It's

338
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:30.721
looking through our server,
