33
00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.351
engineering. It doesn't matter

34
00:01:01.392 --> 00:01:02.271
how much compute you

35
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.930
use or what tool

36
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.411
or model you choose

37
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.790
or what new innovation

38
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.510
was just released. Some

39
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.609
aspects of engineering never

40
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.769
change. When there are

41
00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:13.528
massive trend shifts and

42
00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:14.948
revolutions in the tech

43
00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:18.087
industry, something incredible happens.

44
00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.246
If you pay attention,

45
00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:19.927
you can see the

46
00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:22.206
aspects that never change

47
00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:23.245
and you can place

48
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:24.465
big bets on them.

49
00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:25.525
One of these aspects

50
00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:26.965
of engineering that never

51
00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.125
change is resurfacing in

52
00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:30.584
a big way. It's
