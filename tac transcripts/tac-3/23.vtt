481
00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:30.673
exactly what was generated.

482
00:11:30.833 --> 00:11:31.354
If we go ahead

483
00:11:31.354 --> 00:11:32.273
and collapse here, we

484
00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:33.273
can see this exactly,

485
00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:34.111
right? This was our

486
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.711
plan that was generated

487
00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:38.210
from our chore template

488
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.688
meta prompt. Okay. Why

489
00:11:39.688 --> 00:11:40.587
is this so interesting?

490
00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:40.927
Why is it so

491
00:11:40.927 --> 00:11:42.008
powerful? It's because we

492
00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:44.265
can now template our

493
00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:45.738
engineering. If we keep

494
00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:46.477
scrolling here, you can

495
00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:48.116
see our last section

496
00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:49.777
is just chore with

497
00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:51.176
the claw code argument

498
00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:52.634
parameter that just takes

499
00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:53.855
whatever we passed in

500
00:11:53.955 --> 00:11:55.075
right here, takes our

501
00:11:55.075 --> 00:11:56.734
string and places it

502
00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:57.754
down here as the

503
00:11:57.754 --> 00:11:59.052
chore. And this is

504
00:11:59.052 --> 00:11:59.773
the section that we

505
00:11:59.773 --> 00:12:01.533
reference in our purpose.
