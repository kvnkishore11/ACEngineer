1913
00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:31.297
planning and our direct

1914
00:40:31.297 --> 00:40:33.235
planning by templating our

1915
00:40:33.235 --> 00:40:34.175
engineering to let our

1916
00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:35.954
agents write the first

1917
00:40:36.014 --> 00:40:37.753
and sometimes final draft

1918
00:40:37.793 --> 00:40:38.592
of our plans, as

1919
00:40:38.592 --> 00:40:39.592
you saw here in

1920
00:40:39.592 --> 00:40:40.472
this codebase. And

1921
00:40:40.472 --> 00:40:41.291
if we look over,

1922
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:42.791
this agent is still

1923
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:43.971
planning. This is a

1924
00:40:43.971 --> 00:40:45.449
entire feature. It takes

1925
00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:46.509
a lot more work.

1926
00:40:46.509 --> 00:40:47.369
So it's running really

1927
00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:48.568
high class compute. Check

1928
00:40:48.568 --> 00:40:49.807
this out. And it's

1929
00:40:49.807 --> 00:40:51.206
running in reasoning mode.

1930
00:40:51.226 --> 00:40:52.686
We, of course, activated

1931
00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:53.806
reasoning mode, and it

1932
00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:54.885
is planning this work

1933
00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.525
for us. If we

1934
00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:56.625
open up our spec,

1935
00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:57.384
we can see we

1936
00:40:57.384 --> 00:40:59.503
have query history panel,

1937
00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:00.744
right? Our agent just
