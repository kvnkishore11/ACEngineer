654
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.068
device agentic coding. Okay.

655
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:01.768
What we're doing right

656
00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:02.748
now is just the

657
00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:03.506
beginning. It's just the

658
00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:05.265
bedrock to really, really

659
00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:06.965
scale or impact templates

660
00:15:06.985 --> 00:15:08.344
are critically important for

661
00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:09.244
this. Look at all

662
00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:09.942
the work we just

663
00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:10.722
did. Look at how

664
00:15:10.722 --> 00:15:12.381
reusable this is. This

665
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:13.581
is fantastic. We can

666
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.940
see there's the report,

667
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.438
there's the files changed

668
00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:17.379
all the work that

669
00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:18.398
our agent just did.

670
00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:19.049
If we hop back

671
00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:19.788
over to our plan,

672
00:15:19.788 --> 00:15:20.448
we can scroll to

673
00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:22.427
the validation commands and

674
00:15:22.587 --> 00:15:24.826
we're embedding another lever

675
00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:25.966
of agentic coding. We

676
00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.485
have several self validating

677
00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:29.083
loops with tests. All

678
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.182
right. So not only
