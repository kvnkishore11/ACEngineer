00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.180
do here contains one

122
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.699
of many solutions to

123
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.838
the my codebase

124
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.998
is too big problem.

125
00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:36.177
When you template your

126
00:03:36.177 --> 00:03:38.177
engineering, You encode your

127
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:40.436
problem solving into reusable

128
00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:42.316
units that you, your

129
00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:44.034
team, and your agents

130
00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:45.514
can see, use, and

131
00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.872
importantly, improve. Plans are

132
00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:49.032
the end result of

133
00:03:49.032 --> 00:03:50.412
templates. It's how we

134
00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:51.931
implement this tactic on

135
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.330
a functional level. But

136
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.250
planning alone is expensive.

137
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.550
It's time consuming, and

138
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.709
there's always something to

139
00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.989
miss. And the time

140
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.687
planning consumes scales with
