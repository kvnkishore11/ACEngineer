1099
00:23:59.007 --> 00:24:00.346
better the result okay

1100
00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:00.926
so that's the first

1101
00:24:00.926 --> 00:24:02.726
reason next we force

1102
00:24:02.726 --> 00:24:03.905
our prompts plans and

1103
00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:05.944
templates to be isolated,

1104
00:24:06.045 --> 00:24:08.500
reusable, and improvable assets

1105
00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.957
with zero dependencies. Okay?

1106
00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:12.733
By having this expectation

1107
00:24:12.733 --> 00:24:13.173
that we're going to

1108
00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:15.430
run fresh instances, Right.

1109
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.388
We now have a

1110
00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:18.248
pattern where we encode

1111
00:24:18.328 --> 00:24:20.446
templates to solve problems

1112
00:24:20.446 --> 00:24:22.106
repeatedly in the way

1113
00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:23.445
that our specific code

1114
00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:24.904
base and problem and

1115
00:24:24.904 --> 00:24:26.943
application needs. And when

1116
00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:28.243
we generate the plans,

1117
00:24:28.304 --> 00:24:28.703
we can do the

1118
00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:29.823
exact same thing. Right.
