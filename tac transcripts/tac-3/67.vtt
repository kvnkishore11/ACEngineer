1556
00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:31.038
names for each query.

1557
00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:32.034
in the side panel.

1558
00:33:32.034 --> 00:33:33.394
When we click, we

1559
00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:35.153
refocus the main panel

1560
00:33:35.173 --> 00:33:36.772
button next to, what

1561
00:33:36.952 --> 00:33:38.093
was this called? Upload

1562
00:33:38.113 --> 00:33:39.932
data. Great. So now

1563
00:33:39.932 --> 00:33:41.153
we have this. And

1564
00:33:41.153 --> 00:33:41.892
if we hop into

1565
00:33:41.892 --> 00:33:42.652
the terminal, we can

1566
00:33:42.652 --> 00:33:44.332
see our previous agent

1567
00:33:44.352 --> 00:33:45.071
has completed all the

1568
00:33:45.071 --> 00:33:46.231
work. So it's implemented

1569
00:33:46.231 --> 00:33:47.491
this. We have 52

1570
00:33:47.491 --> 00:33:48.951
tests, right? 18 new

1571
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:50.730
SQL injection prevention tests.

1572
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.351
And we can of

1573
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:52.570
course refresh our server

1574
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:53.810
here and just validate

1575
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:54.891
that this code works.

1576
00:33:54.911 --> 00:33:55.270
All right. So we

1577
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.769
can type something random,

1578
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.910
users can cat email.

1579
00:33:59.617 --> 00:34:00.077
right? So we're just
