434
00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:30.524
focus on the right

435
00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:31.062
files. So you can

436
00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:32.562
see here as headers,

437
00:10:32.562 --> 00:10:33.721
we have our detailed

438
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:35.913
instructions, We have relevant

439
00:10:35.913 --> 00:10:37.711
files to help guide

440
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:38.831
our agent to success.

441
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.889
We then have our

442
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.548
plan format. Something super

443
00:10:41.548 --> 00:10:42.467
important to note here,

444
00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:43.307
we're asking our agent

445
00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:44.546
to create a new

446
00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:45.225
plan. What is a

447
00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:46.085
plan? It's just a

448
00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:46.985
prompt, right? It's a

449
00:10:46.985 --> 00:10:48.202
large prompt. So this

450
00:10:48.202 --> 00:10:50.101
is this tour file

451
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:50.789
here. This is a

452
00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:52.229
meta prompt, right? It's

453
00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:53.868
a prompt that generates

454
00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:55.288
a prompt. This is

455
00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.226
extremely powerful. Not only

456
00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:58.346
should we stop coding,

457
00:10:58.426 --> 00:10:59.426
we should also lean

458
00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:00.904
into and leverage our
