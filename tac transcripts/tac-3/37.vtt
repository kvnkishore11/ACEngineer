825
00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:31.326
me, you will be

826
00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:32.945
wrong, okay? Tools will

827
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.544
change. Models will improve.

828
00:18:34.644 --> 00:18:35.222
All right. We know

829
00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:36.021
this for a fact.

830
00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:36.840
Let's smash this bug.

831
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.079
So slash bug and

832
00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:38.778
then end quotes here

833
00:18:38.778 --> 00:18:40.178
for our argument. You

834
00:18:40.178 --> 00:18:40.537
know, we still have

835
00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:41.976
that exact same format,

836
00:18:42.795 --> 00:18:43.693
right? So we have

837
00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:45.332
bug down here at

838
00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:45.791
the bottom of the

839
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.750
file. And then we

840
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.549
have, of course, our

841
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:48.689
template right above that.

842
00:18:48.689 --> 00:18:49.067
And we can go

843
00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:50.227
into preview mode, right?

844
00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:50.705
So we have our

845
00:18:50.705 --> 00:18:51.546
bug. We have our

846
00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:53.203
plan format, relevant files

847
00:18:53.263 --> 00:18:54.821
and instructions. Okay. And

848
00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:55.321
of course at the

849
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:56.080
top we have our

850
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.380
purpose. So this is

851
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.498
our bug smashing template,

852
00:18:59.498 --> 00:19:00.936
fully reusable. It's gonna
