777
00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:30.467
open the terminal just

778
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.645
like before. And once

779
00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.665
we kick this off,

780
00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:34.025
I'll fully explain why

781
00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:35.223
I keep opening new

782
00:17:35.223 --> 00:17:36.883
terminals and new cloud

783
00:17:36.883 --> 00:17:38.063
code instances. So we'll

784
00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:38.721
boot up Claude Code

785
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:39.981
again and then we'll

786
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:41.461
type, guess what? Slash

787
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.759
bug. Okay. And you

788
00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:43.679
saw it inside of

789
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.419
our commands. We have

790
00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:45.557
slash bug. And so

791
00:17:45.557 --> 00:17:46.897
let's solve a bug,

792
00:17:46.897 --> 00:17:47.297
right? So we're going

793
00:17:47.297 --> 00:17:48.356
to write a high

794
00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:49.796
level prompt that directs

795
00:17:49.796 --> 00:17:50.875
our agent toward the

796
00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:52.273
goal we want accomplished.

797
00:17:52.273 --> 00:17:53.746
Guess what's in? This

798
00:17:54.005 --> 00:17:55.285
.bug markdown file, you

799
00:17:55.285 --> 00:17:56.443
guessed it, it's a

800
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.923
meta prompt that takes

801
00:17:57.923 --> 00:17:59.541
a template to generate

802
00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.121
a plan. This pattern,
