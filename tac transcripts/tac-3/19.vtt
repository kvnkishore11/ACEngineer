388
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:30.697
four, run validation commands.

389
00:09:30.697 --> 00:09:31.177
And you can see

390
00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:32.157
here, we have a

391
00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:33.676
header that describes what

392
00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:34.535
we're gonna run to

393
00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:35.455
validate that the work

394
00:09:35.455 --> 00:09:37.374
done was successful. All

395
00:09:37.374 --> 00:09:38.153
right, and then we

396
00:09:38.153 --> 00:09:38.972
have a final notes

397
00:09:38.993 --> 00:09:40.172
section. So this is

398
00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:42.490
the generated plan. Okay,

399
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.070
so we just ran

400
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.568
a prompt that created

401
00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:45.768
a plan for us.

402
00:09:45.768 --> 00:09:46.986
It turned our one

403
00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.005
sentence prompt into an

404
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.404
entire plan. Okay, so

405
00:09:50.404 --> 00:09:52.403
let's understand how this

406
00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:53.543
happened, right? Let's open

407
00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:55.341
up dot Claude commands.

408
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:55.721
You can see we

409
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:56.820
have a whole slew

410
00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.318
of reusable prompts. Let's

411
00:09:58.318 --> 00:09:59.457
click into chore and

412
00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:01.116
understand what this prompt
