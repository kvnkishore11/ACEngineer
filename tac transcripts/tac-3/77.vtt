1813
00:38:30.132 --> 00:38:30.931
you come in here,

1814
00:38:31.052 --> 00:38:31.791
you write it out,

1815
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:32.471
you fill it out.

1816
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:33.449
You'll find that you'll

1817
00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:35.228
need some sections while

1818
00:38:35.228 --> 00:38:36.327
other sections aren't that

1819
00:38:36.327 --> 00:38:37.527
important. All right. But

1820
00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:38.186
that's up to you.

1821
00:38:38.206 --> 00:38:38.666
This is where a

1822
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:39.905
lot of your key

1823
00:38:39.925 --> 00:38:42.143
essential engineering time and

1824
00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:43.222
resources will be spent.

1825
00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:43.963
You want to be

1826
00:38:44.003 --> 00:38:45.342
building the system. That

1827
00:38:45.362 --> 00:38:46.601
builds the system, right?

1828
00:38:46.762 --> 00:38:47.242
This is what we're

1829
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:48.181
doing when we template

1830
00:38:48.181 --> 00:38:49.880
our engineering. Okay. So

1831
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.280
we see this is

1832
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.380
still running. This is

1833
00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:51.900
a feature. So it's

1834
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.260
going to be a

1835
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.260
lot more work. Check

1836
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.061
this out. Look at

1837
00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:54.981
how much work our

1838
00:38:54.981 --> 00:38:56.420
agent is doing in

1839
00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.820
the background, right? I'm

1840
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.320
not, we're not aware

1841
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.239
of this, right? You
