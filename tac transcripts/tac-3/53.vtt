1211
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.128
by conversational, I mean

1212
00:26:30.128 --> 00:26:31.169
more than one prompt,

1213
00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:32.048
right? We want one

1214
00:26:32.307 --> 00:26:33.946
shot successes. And that

1215
00:26:33.946 --> 00:26:35.402
doesn't mean that our

1216
00:26:35.402 --> 00:26:36.461
agents do a ton

1217
00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:37.480
of work, right? That's

1218
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.439
the whole point, right?

1219
00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:39.897
Size goes up, but

1220
00:26:40.018 --> 00:26:40.977
it does mean that

1221
00:26:40.977 --> 00:26:42.815
our plans are prompts

1222
00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:45.373
scaled up contains everything

1223
00:26:45.373 --> 00:26:46.432
an agent needs to

1224
00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:48.090
get started. And you

1225
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.489
can really pack your

1226
00:26:49.489 --> 00:26:50.788
plans in. Okay, right

1227
00:26:50.788 --> 00:26:51.807
here, I have a

1228
00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:53.705
relatively small 100 line

1229
00:26:53.705 --> 00:26:55.005
plan that is going

1230
00:26:55.005 --> 00:26:56.003
to, you know, you

1231
00:26:56.003 --> 00:26:56.722
can see all the

1232
00:26:56.722 --> 00:26:58.433
files is modifying. See

1233
00:26:58.433 --> 00:26:59.134
all the work that's

1234
00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:00.554
happening right here relatively
