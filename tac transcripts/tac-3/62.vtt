1423
00:30:58.703 --> 00:31:00.442
base without structure, without

1424
00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:01.461
knowing how you do

1425
00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:03.200
things is a plan

1426
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.659
for failure. It will

1427
00:31:04.659 --> 00:31:06.116
not scale into the

1428
00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:08.595
true agentic engineering future

1429
00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:09.295
and to the true

1430
00:31:09.414 --> 00:31:11.153
agentic engineers we are

1431
00:31:11.153 --> 00:31:12.571
aiming to become. As

1432
00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:13.891
you progress through each

1433
00:31:13.891 --> 00:31:15.281
lesson here, You'll become

1434
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:17.000
an engineer they can't

1435
00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:18.520
replace. Okay. So this

1436
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.900
is one agent isolated

1437
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.640
right here. It's going

1438
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.859
to keep solving problems

1439
00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.419
over and over. This

1440
00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:24.538
idea of refreshing your

1441
00:31:24.538 --> 00:31:25.838
agent every single time

1442
00:31:25.838 --> 00:31:26.498
you want to run

1443
00:31:26.538 --> 00:31:28.278
is super, super important,

1444
00:31:28.278 --> 00:31:29.856
right? This enables true

1445
00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:31.636
off-device Agentic Coding. Let
