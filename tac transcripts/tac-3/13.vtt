250
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:30.812
If we close everything

251
00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:32.370
here, go to app

252
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:33.651
server, you can see

253
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.709
our dot environment variable

254
00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:36.848
file was automatically copied

255
00:06:36.848 --> 00:06:37.769
in or agent set

256
00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:38.687
everything up our back

257
00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:39.687
in dependencies, front of

258
00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:41.706
dependencies and everything is

259
00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:42.687
completed and we had

260
00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:43.786
it report its work.

261
00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:44.838
Now let's open up

262
00:06:44.877 --> 00:06:45.877
a new terminal here

263
00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:46.997
and we'll run our

264
00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:48.276
start script once again.

265
00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:49.576
So I'll say scripts

266
00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:50.815
start and let's just

267
00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:51.516
go ahead and boot

268
00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:52.814
up our natural language

269
00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:54.774
SQL application. If we

270
00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:55.713
open up the browser,

271
00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:56.533
you can see our

272
00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.553
natural language SQL interface.

273
00:06:58.653 --> 00:07:00.112
