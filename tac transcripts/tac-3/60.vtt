1374
00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:00.209
work over a long

1375
00:30:00.209 --> 00:30:01.148
period of time. As

1376
00:30:01.148 --> 00:30:01.949
you can see here

1377
00:30:01.949 --> 00:30:03.068
with this looks like

1378
00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:03.909
our task just got

1379
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:05.528
completed. This new task

1380
00:30:05.528 --> 00:30:06.587
was implemented. We got

1381
00:30:06.607 --> 00:30:07.988
tests. We got read

1382
00:30:07.988 --> 00:30:08.948
me updates just like

1383
00:30:08.948 --> 00:30:09.907
we asked everything is

1384
00:30:09.907 --> 00:30:10.928
here. And of course

1385
00:30:10.928 --> 00:30:11.748
we have that final

1386
00:30:11.748 --> 00:30:13.086
report step. It's running

1387
00:30:13.086 --> 00:30:14.507
that get diff and

1388
00:30:14.507 --> 00:30:15.406
check this out. It's

1389
00:30:15.467 --> 00:30:16.567
checking its own work

1390
00:30:16.567 --> 00:30:18.146
right self validation. It

1391
00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:19.086
has two issues it

1392
00:30:19.086 --> 00:30:20.026
needs to fix here.

1393
00:30:20.026 --> 00:30:20.746
It's going to fix

1394
00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:21.885
them automatically right. This

1395
00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:23.150
is the power. Of

1396
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.588
templating your engineering. I

1397
00:30:24.588 --> 00:30:25.728
still haven't lifted a

1398
00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:26.907
finger. I have stopped

1399
00:30:26.928 --> 00:30:28.287
coding. I barely did

1400
00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:29.306
anything with the plan,

1401
00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:30.445
right? So this is
