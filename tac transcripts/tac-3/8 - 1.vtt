140
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.687
planning consumes scales with

141
00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:02.586
the difficulty of the

142
00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:03.606
problem you're aiming to

143
00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.086
solve. And of course,

144
00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:06.758
the size and complexity

145
00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:07.557
of your codebase.

146
00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:08.798
There's always something to

147
00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:09.937
miss. So how can

148
00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.076
we take our plans

149
00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:12.276
to the next level

150
00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:13.937
and encode problem solving

151
00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.196
into reusable units so

152
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:17.175
we don't burn our

153
00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:19.435
precious engineering time planning?

154
00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:20.855
We need a solution

155
00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.096
that works on small

156
00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.375
to large codebases

157
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:24.415
that can run on

158
00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:25.735
a variety of work,

159
00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:27.954
including chores, bugs, small

160
00:04:27.954 --> 00:04:29.735
features, large features, new

161
00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:30.994
codebases, all the
