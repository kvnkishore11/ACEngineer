200
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:30.875
base. Let's go ahead

201
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:31.413
and open up the

202
00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:33.396
terminal. And let's clone

203
00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:35.055
in the lesson three

204
00:05:35.115 --> 00:05:36.834
repository link available in

205
00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:37.814
your loot box below.

206
00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:39.673
I'll CDN and I'll

207
00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.713
open up VS code

208
00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:41.812
here. Here we have

209
00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:43.050
our natural language code

210
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.290
base with our changes

211
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.269
from lesson two. I'll

212
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.509
boot up Claude Code

213
00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.326
and fire slash install

214
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:50.745
to have our agent

215
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:51.545
set up our code

216
00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:53.185
base. Important note here,

217
00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:54.524
we're executing a new

218
00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:55.663
script in the install

219
00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:56.283
command. Let's go ahead

220
00:05:56.283 --> 00:05:57.182
and open this up.

221
00:05:57.365 --> 00:05:57.766
If we look at

222
00:05:57.786 --> 00:05:59.504
install.md, you can see

223
00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:00.423
we have a new
