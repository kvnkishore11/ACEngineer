00:43:28.052 --> 00:43:30.092
polish, testing, integration, edge

2060
00:43:30.092 --> 00:43:33.030
cases, acceptance, validation, super

2061
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.389
important. Our agent will

2062
00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:35.748
do all this work.

2063
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:36.568
This is critical. I'm

2064
00:43:36.568 --> 00:43:37.168
not gonna run this

2065
00:43:37.168 --> 00:43:38.146
right now. There is

2066
00:43:38.146 --> 00:43:39.485
a lot of value

2067
00:43:39.485 --> 00:43:41.206
here. In the TAC3

2068
00:43:41.206 --> 00:43:42.405
codebase. Do not

2069
00:43:42.405 --> 00:43:43.264
wait. If you haven't

2070
00:43:43.264 --> 00:43:44.244
been following along, this

2071
00:43:44.244 --> 00:43:44.864
is your call to

2072
00:43:44.864 --> 00:43:46.182
action. Take your time

2073
00:43:46.182 --> 00:43:47.182
to just run one

2074
00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:48.282
of these. All right.

2075
00:43:48.322 --> 00:43:48.822
I want to get

2076
00:43:48.822 --> 00:43:49.481
you to a great

2077
00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:51.320
aha moment with templating

2078
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.519
your engineering. Open up

2079
00:43:52.519 --> 00:43:53.420
a chore. Copy this

2080
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.039
right into your code

2081
00:43:54.039 --> 00:43:55.318
base. You know, use

2082
00:43:55.318 --> 00:43:55.878
this codebase if

2083
00:43:55.898 --> 00:43:56.538
you want, whatever you

2084
00:43:56.538 --> 00:43:57.338
want to do. Run

2085
00:43:57.338 --> 00:43:58.117
one of these. All

2086
00:43:58.117 --> 00:43:59.257
right. Run slash chore

2087
00:43:59.257 --> 00:44:00.177
and just do something
