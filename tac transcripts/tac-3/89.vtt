00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:30.842
Agentic Coding without all of

2114
00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:31.960
these and the upcoming

2115
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.061
tactics, which will take

2116
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:34.219
this to the, to

2117
00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:35.458
the next, next level.

2118
00:44:35.458 --> 00:44:36.338
Okay. We're building on

2119
00:44:36.338 --> 00:44:37.358
top of the tactics

2120
00:44:37.378 --> 00:44:38.117
we're building on top

2121
00:44:38.117 --> 00:44:38.976
of principles of AI

2122
00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:39.896
coding. We're putting it

2123
00:44:39.896 --> 00:44:41.295
all together and we

2124
00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:43.134
are automating our work

2125
00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:44.432
And we are learning

2126
00:44:44.552 --> 00:44:45.532
to use agents. We're

2127
00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:47.751
becoming agentic engineers. We

2128
00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:49.010
build the system that

2129
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.068
builds the system. I

2130
00:44:50.068 --> 00:44:50.927
hope you can see

2131
00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.626
how templating, how higher

2132
00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:54.126
order prompts and how

2133
00:44:54.326 --> 00:44:56.123
meta prompting and planning

2134
00:44:56.123 --> 00:44:58.003
is a key, key

2135
00:44:58.003 --> 00:44:59.740
aspect of becoming an

2136
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.639
agentic engineer. So what's
