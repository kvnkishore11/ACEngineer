00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:31.707
changing the engineering game

85
00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.427
because you'll be one

86
00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:34.288
of them. What we

87
00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.207
do in this lesson

88
00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.026
will unlock your ability

89
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.247
to not just augment,

90
00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.347
but automate the entire

91
00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:42.506
software development lifecycle with

92
00:02:42.506 --> 00:02:44.406
your agents shipping work

93
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:46.198
on your behalf. Those

94
00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.698
who plan the future

95
00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:49.157
tend to create it

96
00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:51.356
success is planned in

97
00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:52.637
this lesson we enter

98
00:02:52.637 --> 00:02:53.937
the plan and build

99
00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:55.556
phase of the agentic

100
00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:57.436
software developer life cycle

101
00:02:57.436 --> 00:02:59.276
with just three tactics

102
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:00.675
you'll learn the pareto
