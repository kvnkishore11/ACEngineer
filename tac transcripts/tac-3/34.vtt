WEBVTT

754
00:16:59.169 --> 00:17:00.048
is how far can

755
00:17:00.048 --> 00:17:00.989
we push this? And

756
00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:02.248
the answer is very,

757
00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.727
very far. Okay. Let's

758
00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:04.426
look at some more

759
00:17:04.426 --> 00:17:06.786
comprehensive templates to agentically

760
00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:08.266
complete bugs in the

761
00:17:08.266 --> 00:17:09.384
same way. All right.

762
00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:10.065
We can scale this

763
00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:11.183
up to solving bugs,

764
00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:13.323
features, and really anything

765
00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.522
you can encode into

766
00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:15.422
your prompt, right? These

767
00:17:15.422 --> 00:17:17.661
are repeatable solutions for

768
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:19.601
success. Okay. We're literally

769
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:21.220
encoding our engineering. We're

770
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.538
templating our engineering into

771
00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:24.637
the codebase. Okay.

772
00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:26.130
This tactic, It's critical.

773
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.588
Let's knock out a

774
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:27.568
bug in this code

775
00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:27.969
base. I'm going to

776
00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:29.147
close everything here. Let's

777
00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:30.467
open the terminal just
