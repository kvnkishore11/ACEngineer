2180
00:45:59.382 --> 00:46:00.302
is how you scale

2181
00:46:00.302 --> 00:46:01.940
your agents into your

2182
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.478
codebase and solve

2183
00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:06.016
your domain specific problems.

2184
00:46:06.197 --> 00:46:07.436
Okay. There's no hand

2185
00:46:07.436 --> 00:46:08.914
waving here. I guess,

2186
00:46:09.273 --> 00:46:09.693
I guess there's a

2187
00:46:09.693 --> 00:46:10.333
lot of hand waving,

2188
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:10.733
but you get the

2189
00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:12.052
point, right? These tactics

2190
00:46:12.112 --> 00:46:13.090
are key ideas you

2191
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.150
can think of every

2192
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.248
single day you're engineering,

2193
00:46:15.469 --> 00:46:16.827
right? Stop coding. Think

2194
00:46:16.827 --> 00:46:17.746
from your agent's perspective,

2195
00:46:17.746 --> 00:46:19.530
template your engineering. All

2196
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.449
right. There is work

2197
00:46:20.449 --> 00:46:21.309
to be done here

2198
00:46:21.389 --> 00:46:22.347
in creating and building

2199
00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.646
up great templates. But

2200
00:46:23.646 --> 00:46:24.586
if you do this

2201
00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:26.166
right, it will change

2202
00:46:26.365 --> 00:46:27.525
everything. I'll see you

2203
00:46:27.525 --> 00:46:28.583
in lesson four where

2204
00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:29.503
we'll learn to let

2205
00:46:29.503 --> 00:46:31.902
your product ship itself.
