1171
00:25:29.207 --> 00:25:30.186
up our context window.

1172
00:25:30.326 --> 00:25:30.987
We let our agent

1173
00:25:30.987 --> 00:25:32.266
focus. Number two, we

1174
00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:33.425
force our prompts, plans,

1175
00:25:33.425 --> 00:25:34.346
and templates to be

1176
00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:37.244
isolated, reusable, improvable assets

1177
00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:38.763
with zero dependencies. Okay.

1178
00:25:38.763 --> 00:25:40.324
And then lastly, most

1179
00:25:40.324 --> 00:25:41.604
importantly, when we use

1180
00:25:41.604 --> 00:25:43.383
fresh agents, right? When

1181
00:25:43.383 --> 00:25:44.303
we use brand new

1182
00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:45.862
agents every single time

1183
00:25:45.862 --> 00:25:47.718
like this, right? When

1184
00:25:47.718 --> 00:25:48.337
we just open up

1185
00:25:48.337 --> 00:25:49.336
brand new instances over

1186
00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:50.737
and over, we prepare

1187
00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:53.175
for true off device

1188
00:25:53.296 --> 00:25:55.134
agentic coding. Remember, we're

1189
00:25:55.134 --> 00:25:58.294
not here to babysit

1190
00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:00.273
a single agent. We
