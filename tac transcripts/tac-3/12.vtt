223
00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:00.423
we have a new

224
00:06:00.423 --> 00:06:01.264
line that's going to

225
00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:01.942
run here. So we're

226
00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:02.663
going to run the

227
00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:03.901
scripts copy.m and this

228
00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:05.281
is going to copy

229
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.141
our dot m file

230
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.019
from our tack to

231
00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.699
codebase. This is

232
00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:08.559
just a quick way

233
00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.158
to reuse resources. If

234
00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:10.918
you open up scripts,

235
00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:11.617
you can see exactly

236
00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:12.516
what that's doing there.

237
00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:13.336
Here we're having an

238
00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:15.355
agent with a reusable

239
00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:16.355
prompt do this work

240
00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.656
for us. Agentically. These

241
00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:20.156
reusable prompts, much like

242
00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:21.675
templates we'll explore here

243
00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:22.656
in this lesson are

244
00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:24.694
extremely powerful time savers

245
00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:26.134
due to how reusable

246
00:06:26.134 --> 00:06:26.954
they are and not

247
00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:27.612
just for you, but

248
00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.112
for your entire team.

249
00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:29.711
So there we go.

250
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:30.812
If we close everything
