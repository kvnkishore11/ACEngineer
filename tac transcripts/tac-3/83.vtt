1964
00:41:29.414 --> 00:41:30.193
the hard work of

1965
00:41:30.193 --> 00:41:31.032
looking through your code

1966
00:41:31.032 --> 00:41:32.211
base, figuring out what

1967
00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:33.112
needs to go where,

1968
00:41:33.112 --> 00:41:34.210
and you can template

1969
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.010
all of that. Another

1970
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:35.989
great reason to use

1971
00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:37.190
templates, another reason why

1972
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.110
templates are so important,

1973
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.929
you can, of course,

1974
00:41:38.969 --> 00:41:40.148
improve them. As you

1975
00:41:40.148 --> 00:41:40.947
scale up your work

1976
00:41:40.947 --> 00:41:42.088
and increase your size

1977
00:41:42.088 --> 00:41:44.226
KPI, your feature prompts

1978
00:41:44.226 --> 00:41:45.186
will likely get bigger

1979
00:41:45.206 --> 00:41:45.766
or they'll get more

1980
00:41:45.766 --> 00:41:47.824
precise, and that's great.

1981
00:41:47.824 --> 00:41:48.304
You'll be able to

1982
00:41:48.304 --> 00:41:49.903
solve more problems in

1983
00:41:49.903 --> 00:41:51.103
a better, more accurate

1984
00:41:51.103 --> 00:41:52.103
way over and over

1985
00:41:52.103 --> 00:41:52.922
and over, right? We

1986
00:41:52.922 --> 00:41:54.322
get this self-improving loop

1987
00:41:54.342 --> 00:41:55.021
inside of your code

1988
00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:56.181
base for your agents,

1989
00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:56.601
all right? And then

1990
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:57.440
last but not least,

1991
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.159
why are templates so

1992
00:41:58.159 --> 00:41:58.940
important? button, you get

1993
00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.278
to encode custom templates,
