1889
00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.288
be generated, right? It's

1890
00:40:00.288 --> 00:40:01.007
the code, it's the

1891
00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:03.005
engineering work compressed into

1892
00:40:03.005 --> 00:40:04.344
natural language that your

1893
00:40:04.344 --> 00:40:05.724
agent will expand. So

1894
00:40:05.744 --> 00:40:06.523
that's why plans are

1895
00:40:06.523 --> 00:40:07.902
so important. Now, why

1896
00:40:07.902 --> 00:40:09.181
are templates so important?

1897
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.681
As we've discussed, templates

1898
00:40:10.681 --> 00:40:12.199
let you encode your

1899
00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:13.757
engineering practices into your

1900
00:40:13.757 --> 00:40:15.416
codebase for, again,

1901
00:40:15.536 --> 00:40:16.735
you, your team, and

1902
00:40:16.735 --> 00:40:18.295
most importantly, your agents.

1903
00:40:18.394 --> 00:40:19.773
Writing plans take time.

1904
00:40:19.873 --> 00:40:20.753
And they're error prone,

1905
00:40:20.753 --> 00:40:21.911
right? We as humans,

1906
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:22.831
we are error prone.

1907
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:23.969
That's okay. There's a

1908
00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:25.268
new best tool for

1909
00:40:25.268 --> 00:40:26.327
the job. We can

1910
00:40:26.407 --> 00:40:27.447
not only stop coding,

1911
00:40:27.447 --> 00:40:28.797
but we can reduce

1912
00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:29.876
our writing and our

1913
00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:31.297
planning and our direct
