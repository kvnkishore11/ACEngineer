1737
00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:00.074
Let's copy this. Go

1738
00:37:00.074 --> 00:37:01.769
to the terminal. Fire

1739
00:37:01.769 --> 00:37:03.369
it off. Okay. This

1740
00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:04.748
line is where things

1741
00:37:04.748 --> 00:37:05.347
are all going. I

1742
00:37:05.347 --> 00:37:06.168
know this looks weird.

1743
00:37:06.588 --> 00:37:07.027
I know it might

1744
00:37:07.027 --> 00:37:08.706
feel uncomfortable. We don't

1745
00:37:08.706 --> 00:37:09.686
see our agent. We

1746
00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:10.286
don't know what it's

1747
00:37:10.286 --> 00:37:11.625
doing, but as we

1748
00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:12.744
scale up, as we

1749
00:37:12.744 --> 00:37:14.483
improve our plan writing,

1750
00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:15.304
as we learn the

1751
00:37:15.304 --> 00:37:17.163
template, our engineering, as

1752
00:37:17.163 --> 00:37:18.222
we know our agent's

1753
00:37:18.222 --> 00:37:19.860
perspective, this is what

1754
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.300
we want to do

1755
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.621
right across the entire

1756
00:37:21.621 --> 00:37:23.039
software development life cycle.

1757
00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.458
This prompt here represents

1758
00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:25.778
the planning phase. We

1759
00:37:25.778 --> 00:37:27.117
can of course embed

1760
00:37:27.117 --> 00:37:28.257
more prompts into the

1761
00:37:28.257 --> 00:37:29.536
planning phase, more agents

1762
00:37:29.536 --> 00:37:30.496
into the planning phase,
