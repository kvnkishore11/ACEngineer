947
00:20:59.873 --> 00:21:01.092
statement. We have steps

948
00:21:01.092 --> 00:21:02.590
to reproduce, right? So

949
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.450
full on engineering steps

950
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.709
to reproduce. You start

951
00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:06.709
and then you pass

952
00:21:06.709 --> 00:21:07.968
in something malicious or

953
00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:08.688
send in a natural

954
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:09.807
language query, and then

955
00:21:09.807 --> 00:21:11.086
it'll actually get executed.

956
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.125
Okay. So classic stuff

957
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:13.005
there. Don't focus too

958
00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:13.644
much on the code

959
00:21:13.644 --> 00:21:15.084
here. Obviously example code

960
00:21:15.084 --> 00:21:15.962
base. We're just using

961
00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:17.002
this as a framework

962
00:21:17.002 --> 00:21:18.924
to learn great agentic

963
00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:20.224
coding and agentic engineering.

964
00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:20.844
We have a root

965
00:21:20.844 --> 00:21:22.144
calls analysis. And then

966
00:21:22.144 --> 00:21:23.042
we have, of course,

967
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:24.402
our relevant files inside

968
00:21:24.402 --> 00:21:25.402
of our template. We

969
00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:27.121
asked our agent to,

970
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:27.601
if you need to

971
00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:28.460
create a new file,

972
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.019
right? So if I

973
00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:29.979
type new file here,
