1579
00:33:59.617 --> 00:34:00.077
right? So we're just

1580
00:34:00.077 --> 00:34:00.856
kind of typing whatever.

1581
00:34:00.936 --> 00:34:01.517
And there we go.

1582
00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:02.256
So we're can catting

1583
00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:03.494
name and email all

1584
00:34:03.494 --> 00:34:04.834
of our SQL injection

1585
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:05.613
code looks like it

1586
00:34:05.613 --> 00:34:07.811
was successful, hide, upload

1587
00:34:07.832 --> 00:34:09.451
data, open up products.

1588
00:34:09.451 --> 00:34:10.210
And we're just doing

1589
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.989
some testing here, right?

1590
00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:11.728
We want to understand

1591
00:34:11.728 --> 00:34:13.268
that our fixed SQL

1592
00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:15.626
injection vulnerabilities task did

1593
00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:16.405
the job. And so

1594
00:34:16.445 --> 00:34:16.945
this is why it's

1595
00:34:16.945 --> 00:34:18.164
important to have steps

1596
00:34:18.164 --> 00:34:19.702
to reproduce inside of

1597
00:34:19.702 --> 00:34:20.342
the plan. Now we

1598
00:34:20.342 --> 00:34:21.161
can just come in,

1599
00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:22.061
look at the work

1600
00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:22.880
that was supposed to

1601
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.458
be done and validated

1602
00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:25.518
ourselves as well, right?

1603
00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:26.856
We can also scroll

1604
00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:27.934
down to the validation

1605
00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.052
commands that our agent

1606
00:34:29.052 --> 00:34:30.050
was running. And we
