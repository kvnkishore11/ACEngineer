1401
00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:30.445
right? So this is

1402
00:30:30.445 --> 00:30:31.644
really powerful. I built

1403
00:30:31.644 --> 00:30:32.824
these tactics for you

1404
00:30:32.824 --> 00:30:33.243
to be in a

1405
00:30:33.243 --> 00:30:35.042
very specific configuration so

1406
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:35.982
that you can think

1407
00:30:36.082 --> 00:30:37.582
about these tactics every

1408
00:30:37.582 --> 00:30:38.621
single day on the

1409
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:39.880
ground as you're engineering,

1410
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.419
right? This is Tactical

1411
00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:42.719
agentic coding. Think about

1412
00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:43.617
these every single day

1413
00:30:43.617 --> 00:30:45.076
you're engineering boots on

1414
00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.536
the ground. Stop coding,

1415
00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:48.255
take your agent's perspective,

1416
00:30:48.315 --> 00:30:50.153
and now template your

1417
00:30:50.153 --> 00:30:51.848
engineering. All right. If

1418
00:30:51.848 --> 00:30:52.628
you do this right,

1419
00:30:52.689 --> 00:30:54.686
it will change everything.

1420
00:30:54.807 --> 00:30:55.846
This is a massive

1421
00:30:55.846 --> 00:30:58.023
differentiator. Having agents run

1422
00:30:58.023 --> 00:30:58.703
loose on your code

1423
00:30:58.703 --> 00:31:00.442
base without structure, without
