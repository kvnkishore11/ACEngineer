161
00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:30.994
codebases, all the

162
00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:32.153
way up to massive

163
00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:34.173
refactors. We do this

164
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:35.524
by taking our successful

165
00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:37.444
plans and converting them

166
00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:39.343
into templates, one of

167
00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:40.882
the 12 leverage points

168
00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:42.482
of agentic coding. In

169
00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.161
this lesson, we differentiate

170
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.980
what you can do

171
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.360
by building a suite

172
00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.699
of templates that give

173
00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.519
you full control over

174
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.218
how your agent solves

175
00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:52.976
a variety of problems.

176
00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:54.696
Agentic coding tools like

177
00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:57.134
Codex, Copilot, Devon, Jules,

178
00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:58.934
Gemini CLI, and whatever

179
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:00.673
comes next, these tools
