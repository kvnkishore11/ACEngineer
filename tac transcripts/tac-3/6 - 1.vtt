102
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:00.675
you'll learn the pareto

103
00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:02.455
80 20 of agentic

104
00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.474
engineering first you stopped

105
00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:05.754
coding our hands and

106
00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:06.993
our minds are no

107
00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:08.234
longer the best tool

108
00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:09.693
for the job then

109
00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:11.325
you adopt your agent's

110
00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:12.805
perspective so you can

111
00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:14.425
maximize the leverage you

112
00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.024
get from your agents.

113
00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:17.883
Then you can template

114
00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:19.823
your engineering. This enables

115
00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:21.602
you to deliver consistent

116
00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:24.222
results across hundreds of

117
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:25.941
agent executions, no matter

118
00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:27.920
the size or complexity

119
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.979
of your codebase.

120
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.879
That's right. What we

121
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.180
do here contains one
