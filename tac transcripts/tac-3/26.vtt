556
00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:00.038
the instructions to implement

557
00:13:00.038 --> 00:13:02.557
the plan, then report

558
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:04.280
the completed work. All

559
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.181
right. So here we

560
00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:06.020
have instructions, just a

561
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.559
single instruction. Read the

562
00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:09.499
plan. Think hard. We're

563
00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:11.717
activating Claude Codes information

564
00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:13.278
dense keyword to activate

565
00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:14.517
the reasoning model. We're

566
00:13:14.517 --> 00:13:15.116
using one of the

567
00:13:15.116 --> 00:13:16.475
12 leverage points of

568
00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:17.596
Agentic Coding by turning

569
00:13:17.615 --> 00:13:18.556
on the reasoning model.

570
00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:19.034
Let's go ahead and

571
00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:19.914
go into Yolo mode.

572
00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:21.034
You can see the

573
00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:22.494
changes flowing in here.

574
00:13:22.922 --> 00:13:24.081
We'll accept all think

575
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:24.921
hard about the plan

576
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:26.421
and implement the plan.

577
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.879
All right. And then

578
00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:29.559
very interestingly here, you

579
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.240
can see as an
