1000
00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:00.837
We're leveraging tests and

1001
00:22:00.837 --> 00:22:01.797
then we have notes.

1002
00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:03.155
Okay. So same idea,

1003
00:22:03.316 --> 00:22:04.914
right? We're encoding our

1004
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:07.374
engineering into templates. Okay.

1005
00:22:07.394 --> 00:22:08.653
Then our agent runs

1006
00:22:08.653 --> 00:22:09.271
it as a meta

1007
00:22:09.271 --> 00:22:10.291
prompt, a prompt that

1008
00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:11.391
generates a prompt. It

1009
00:22:11.391 --> 00:22:12.310
generates a plan that

1010
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.137
we can now, execute.

1011
00:22:14.258 --> 00:22:15.497
Okay. And then once

1012
00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:16.576
again, I promise I'll

1013
00:22:16.576 --> 00:22:17.516
explain this right now.

1014
00:22:17.516 --> 00:22:18.434
So, um, why do

1015
00:22:18.434 --> 00:22:19.055
I keep doing this?

1016
00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:19.753
Let me just get

1017
00:22:19.753 --> 00:22:20.473
this fired off. So

1018
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.452
slash implement and then

1019
00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:23.251
same deal, right? I'll

1020
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:24.291
copy the path to

1021
00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:25.691
our brand new prompt

1022
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.789
file. And then I've

1023
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.128
been working, my plans

1024
00:22:28.209 --> 00:22:29.448
aren't committing any changes.

1025
00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:29.968
So I'm going to

1026
00:22:29.968 --> 00:22:31.346
go ahead and actually
