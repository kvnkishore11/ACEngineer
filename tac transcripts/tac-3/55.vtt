1257
00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:31.166
off the implement markdown

1258
00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.625
file, which passed in

1259
00:27:32.685 --> 00:27:33.765
our plan. So it

1260
00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:34.983
read this file and

1261
00:27:34.983 --> 00:27:35.723
then it read this

1262
00:27:35.723 --> 00:27:37.182
file and then it

1263
00:27:37.182 --> 00:27:38.321
went to work. Okay.

1264
00:27:38.602 --> 00:27:39.582
So we have a

1265
00:27:39.582 --> 00:27:41.461
very, very good idea

1266
00:27:41.759 --> 00:27:43.479
of the exact context,

1267
00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:44.739
right? The perspective of

1268
00:27:44.739 --> 00:27:45.438
our agent when we

1269
00:27:45.438 --> 00:27:46.876
started. All right. So

1270
00:27:46.876 --> 00:27:48.277
ultimately the reason for

1271
00:27:48.277 --> 00:27:49.355
this booting up new

1272
00:27:49.355 --> 00:27:50.135
agents over and over

1273
00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.035
and over, we want

1274
00:27:51.055 --> 00:27:52.733
to move toward true,

1275
00:27:52.854 --> 00:27:54.912
off-device Agentic coding. If

1276
00:27:54.912 --> 00:27:55.671
you do this right,

1277
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.469
it will completely differentiate

1278
00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:59.726
your engineering from the

1279
00:27:59.726 --> 00:28:00.865
rest. So we can
