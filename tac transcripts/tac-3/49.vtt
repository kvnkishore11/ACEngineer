00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:30.803
We know what our

1120
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:31.761
agent is going to

1121
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:32.221
run. We know what

1122
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:33.082
our agent is going

1123
00:24:33.082 --> 00:24:34.441
to execute. OK, this

1124
00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:35.280
is super important. We

1125
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.539
have a trail of

1126
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.038
success or a trail

1127
00:24:38.038 --> 00:24:38.878
of things we can

1128
00:24:38.878 --> 00:24:40.137
improve. Right. When you

1129
00:24:40.137 --> 00:24:41.357
start writing this template,

1130
00:24:41.357 --> 00:24:42.176
you're probably going to

1131
00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:43.116
miss something. You're probably

1132
00:24:43.116 --> 00:24:43.576
going to need to

1133
00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:45.135
add more detail somewhere.

1134
00:24:45.135 --> 00:24:45.515
you're gonna need to

1135
00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:46.333
tweak it, and then

1136
00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:47.050
maybe you'll run into

1137
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.727
a bug where, super

1138
00:24:48.727 --> 00:24:50.003
important here, maybe you'll

1139
00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:50.801
run into a bug

1140
00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:52.340
where you need a

1141
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.739
more specific template to

1142
00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:56.019
address, maybe you have

1143
00:24:56.118 --> 00:24:57.397
a specific weird system

1144
00:24:57.397 --> 00:24:58.237
on your front end

1145
00:24:58.356 --> 00:24:59.756
or a class of

1146
00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:00.795
bugs, then you can
