1711
00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:30.597
to wrap this in

1712
00:36:30.597 --> 00:36:31.777
quotes. We're going to

1713
00:36:31.777 --> 00:36:33.436
escape these quotes here

1714
00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:34.655
and then new line.

1715
00:36:34.655 --> 00:36:35.076
We're going to run

1716
00:36:35.076 --> 00:36:36.054
this in the terminal.

1717
00:36:36.054 --> 00:36:36.594
So we need something

1718
00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:37.793
like this. And for

1719
00:36:37.793 --> 00:36:39.422
brevity, I'm just going

1720
00:36:39.422 --> 00:36:39.902
to paste this in

1721
00:36:39.902 --> 00:36:40.701
and you can see

1722
00:36:40.701 --> 00:36:41.721
exactly what's happening here,

1723
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.960
right? We're running this

1724
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.760
in programmatic mode, right?

1725
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.878
Output format stream running

1726
00:36:46.878 --> 00:36:48.657
in dangerously skip permissions.

1727
00:36:48.657 --> 00:36:49.137
This is going to

1728
00:36:49.137 --> 00:36:50.318
work just fine for

1729
00:36:50.318 --> 00:36:51.456
now. It's very low

1730
00:36:51.456 --> 00:36:52.476
risk. We're setting our

1731
00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.956
model. We want verbose

1732
00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:54.675
and then check this

1733
00:36:54.675 --> 00:36:55.315
out. We're going to

1734
00:36:55.315 --> 00:36:56.396
write the output. We're

1735
00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:57.434
going to stream the

1736
00:36:57.434 --> 00:36:58.735
output into this file.

1737
00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:00.074
Let's copy this. Go
