974
00:21:30.358 --> 00:21:31.358
I asked list the

975
00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:32.097
new files in a

976
00:21:32.097 --> 00:21:33.737
new H3, a new

977
00:21:33.737 --> 00:21:35.196
header called new file.

978
00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.296
So that's exactly what

979
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:36.976
happened here. We have

980
00:21:36.976 --> 00:21:38.595
a new SQL security

981
00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:39.294
file that can be

982
00:21:39.294 --> 00:21:39.993
generated. And then of

983
00:21:40.013 --> 00:21:41.472
course we have step

984
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.211
by step tasks. Okay.

985
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:43.912
And you can see

986
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:44.771
here, this is a

987
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:46.371
non templated portion. If

988
00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:47.710
we just copy important,

989
00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:48.586
We can scroll down

990
00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:49.845
here and see, you

991
00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:50.544
know, step by step

992
00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:52.083
execute every step in

993
00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:53.042
order top to bottom.

994
00:21:53.123 --> 00:21:54.442
Okay. Super important. All

995
00:21:54.442 --> 00:21:55.201
right. And then there

996
00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:55.820
it is. So top

997
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.700
to bottom, all of

998
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.599
our tasks, we of

999
00:21:57.599 --> 00:21:59.199
course have our validation.

1000
00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:00.837
We're leveraging tests and
