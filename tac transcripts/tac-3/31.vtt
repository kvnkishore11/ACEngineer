678
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.182
right. So not only

679
00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:30.822
did it run all

680
00:15:30.822 --> 00:15:31.602
of our PI tests

681
00:15:31.602 --> 00:15:33.302
to prevent regressions, it

682
00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:34.640
also ran server and

683
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.700
main just to make

684
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.460
sure that it works.

685
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.418
All right. So there's

686
00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:38.379
all the files changed.

687
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:38.958
If we want to,

688
00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:39.998
we can of course,

689
00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:41.404
open up a terminal

690
00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:42.524
and run get diff

691
00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:43.345
ourself and we can

692
00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:44.604
see everything that's changed.

693
00:15:44.604 --> 00:15:45.403
All right. Looks great.

694
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.722
It looks very precise.

695
00:15:46.822 --> 00:15:47.743
It looks like exactly

696
00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:48.582
what we asked for,

697
00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:49.981
right? This chore has

698
00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.480
been completed agentically with

699
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:53.020
two prompts, one for

700
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.340
the planning phase and

701
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.279
one for the coding

702
00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:56.899
building phase. Okay. We

703
00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:59.398
can, of course, test

704
00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:00.038
this if we want
