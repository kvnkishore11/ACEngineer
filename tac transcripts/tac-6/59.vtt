WEBVTT

1403
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:30.857
because it has full

1404
00:29:30.857 --> 00:29:32.896
control over this repository,

1405
00:29:32.996 --> 00:29:33.776
right? If we want

1406
00:29:33.796 --> 00:29:34.796
to, we can see

1407
00:29:34.796 --> 00:29:36.214
its work, git diff

1408
00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:38.230
dash dash stat. and

1409
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.068
we wanna run this

1410
00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:42.067
against probably origin main.

1411
00:29:42.228 --> 00:29:42.847
And so you can

1412
00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:43.906
see all the changes

1413
00:29:43.906 --> 00:29:44.866
it's made so far

1414
00:29:45.026 --> 00:29:46.924
against the origin main

1415
00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:48.444
branch. So you can

1416
00:29:48.444 --> 00:29:49.384
see there's our plan.

1417
00:29:49.384 --> 00:29:50.503
It created a nice

1418
00:29:50.503 --> 00:29:51.843
test for us there,

1419
00:29:51.843 --> 00:29:52.323
so on and so

1420
00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:53.221
forth. It has our

1421
00:29:53.221 --> 00:29:54.921
end-to-end tests, it's creating

1422
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:56.101
this. This is part

1423
00:29:56.101 --> 00:29:57.619
of our engineering. We've

1424
00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:58.659
encoded it into our

1425
00:29:58.659 --> 00:29:59.919
template. So this stuff

1426
00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:00.938
just happens all the
