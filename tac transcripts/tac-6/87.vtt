2114
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.141
Documentation is pretty simple.

2115
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:31.719
We just generate documentation

2116
00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:32.478
and then we finalize

2117
00:43:32.478 --> 00:43:33.697
the get operations. So

2118
00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:34.958
this should, probably be

2119
00:43:34.958 --> 00:43:35.597
done. Yep, there it

2120
00:43:35.597 --> 00:43:36.456
is. We're already finished.

2121
00:43:36.496 --> 00:43:37.115
And now we have

2122
00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:38.295
documentation. So if we

2123
00:43:38.295 --> 00:43:39.755
get diff again, and

2124
00:43:39.755 --> 00:43:40.514
we run, what is

2125
00:43:40.514 --> 00:43:41.552
it name? Now what's

2126
00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.373
that command? It's get

2127
00:43:42.373 --> 00:43:43.711
diff name only. Right.

2128
00:43:43.711 --> 00:43:45.010
So that's it origin

2129
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:46.369
main. You can see

2130
00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:47.248
we have all these

2131
00:43:47.248 --> 00:43:48.489
files and importantly, we

2132
00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:49.927
have app docs and

2133
00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:50.686
we have this new

2134
00:43:50.686 --> 00:43:51.746
piece of documentation. Okay.

2135
00:43:51.746 --> 00:43:52.025
So we can open

2136
00:43:52.025 --> 00:43:52.686
this up and we

2137
00:43:52.686 --> 00:43:53.545
can see exactly what

2138
00:43:53.545 --> 00:43:54.585
was created here. So

2139
00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:55.664
it is important to

2140
00:43:55.664 --> 00:43:57.302
note that just like

2141
00:43:57.463 --> 00:43:59.534
our patch, plan, just

2142
00:43:59.534 --> 00:44:01.012
like chore, just like
