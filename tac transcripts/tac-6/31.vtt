691
00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:30.365
is our prompt source.

692
00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:30.904
So let's go ahead

693
00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:31.725
and create an issue

694
00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:33.043
here and fire off

695
00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:34.842
a new workflow. Create

696
00:15:34.842 --> 00:15:35.922
issue. We want a

697
00:15:35.922 --> 00:15:37.301
new feature for our

698
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:39.059
natural language SQL interface.

699
00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:39.678
Let's use something a

700
00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:40.798
little bit more interesting

701
00:15:40.798 --> 00:15:41.597
here. So one click,

702
00:15:42.177 --> 00:15:43.157
table exports. I'm just

703
00:15:43.157 --> 00:15:44.076
going to paste this

704
00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.655
prompt in here using

705
00:15:45.655 --> 00:15:47.335
the ADW workflow. Add

706
00:15:47.374 --> 00:15:48.653
one click table exports

707
00:15:48.653 --> 00:15:49.812
and one click result

708
00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:51.011
export feature to get

709
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:52.831
results as CSV files.

710
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:53.549
We want two new

711
00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:55.828
endpoints. I'm specifying where

712
00:15:55.828 --> 00:15:56.408
we want this to

713
00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:57.168
be triggered. Then I'm

714
00:15:57.168 --> 00:15:58.047
saying, you know, use

715
00:15:58.047 --> 00:15:59.067
the right download icon.

716
00:15:59.067 --> 00:15:59.385
So this is a

717
00:15:59.385 --> 00:16:00.446
high level prompt that's
