1586
00:32:59.724 --> 00:33:00.805
hide button. If we

1587
00:33:00.805 --> 00:33:01.763
click this, you can

1588
00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:02.243
see we do get

1589
00:33:02.243 --> 00:33:03.044
the download which is

1590
00:33:03.044 --> 00:33:04.282
great, but of course

1591
00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:05.143
our UI is a

1592
00:33:05.143 --> 00:33:06.442
little off. So this

1593
00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.001
is a great example

1594
00:33:07.001 --> 00:33:08.361
to showcase the patch

1595
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.559
prompt. We will run

1596
00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:10.979
into issues. We need

1597
00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:12.419
a mechanism inside of

1598
00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:13.798
our workflows to quickly

1599
00:33:13.998 --> 00:33:15.356
knock them out, ideally

1600
00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:16.516
out the loop. Just

1601
00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:16.955
real quick, I'm going

1602
00:33:16.955 --> 00:33:19.134
to type ADW patch.

1603
00:33:19.134 --> 00:33:19.854
I'm going to operate

1604
00:33:19.854 --> 00:33:21.054
this like we're working

1605
00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:22.212
outside the loop just

1606
00:33:22.212 --> 00:33:23.612
for good practice. I'm

1607
00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:24.392
going to copy the

1608
00:33:24.392 --> 00:33:25.550
ADW ID, paste that

1609
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.131
there, and then we're

1610
00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:27.150
going to say, what

1611
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.382
are we patching? make

1612
00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:30.622
sure download button for
