2014
00:41:29.878 --> 00:41:30.637
here, right? This is

2015
00:41:30.637 --> 00:41:32.157
probably the winning workflow.

2016
00:41:32.322 --> 00:41:33.382
Let's move on to

2017
00:41:33.382 --> 00:41:35.561
documentation. So these are

2018
00:41:35.561 --> 00:41:37.161
all composable. So what

2019
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:37.701
we're gonna do here

2020
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:39.240
is just append document.

2021
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.260
We're gonna document this

2022
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.300
feature right at the

2023
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.481
end here, okay? So

2024
00:41:42.481 --> 00:41:43.001
I'm just gonna open

2025
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:44.420
this up, UV run,

2026
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:45.659
paste the file path,

2027
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.019
of course, run against

2028
00:41:47.019 --> 00:41:47.940
the issue ID, and

2029
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.480
I am going to

2030
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.380
run on the same

2031
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.858
workflow, right? The document

2032
00:41:50.858 --> 00:41:52.478
step needs existing work.

2033
00:41:52.778 --> 00:41:53.838
I'm gonna copy the

2034
00:41:53.838 --> 00:41:55.119
ADW ID, paste that,

2035
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.759
and let it kick

2036
00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:57.858
off, okay? So this

2037
00:41:57.858 --> 00:41:59.358
is our documentation step.

2038
00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:00.077
You can see there's
