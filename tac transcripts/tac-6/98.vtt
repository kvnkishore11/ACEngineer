2381
00:48:59.217 --> 00:49:00.436
base, right? With the

2382
00:49:00.456 --> 00:49:01.534
agentic layer that we've

2383
00:49:01.594 --> 00:49:03.293
built up with focus,

2384
00:49:04.032 --> 00:49:05.112
one agent, one prompt,

2385
00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:06.309
one purpose. You know,

2386
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:07.548
you saw end to

2387
00:49:07.548 --> 00:49:08.586
end here, right? We

2388
00:49:08.586 --> 00:49:09.945
now have assets. We

2389
00:49:09.945 --> 00:49:11.364
now have documentation. We

2390
00:49:11.364 --> 00:49:12.461
have a plan. We've

2391
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:13.800
patched some work that

2392
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.018
wasn't quite right. We

2393
00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:15.918
have some improvements to

2394
00:49:15.918 --> 00:49:16.637
make, you know, just

2395
00:49:16.657 --> 00:49:17.456
to make it clear,

2396
00:49:17.795 --> 00:49:19.134
running the ADW test,

2397
00:49:19.233 --> 00:49:20.153
would have caught that.

2398
00:49:20.153 --> 00:49:21.253
So we wrote a

2399
00:49:21.253 --> 00:49:22.932
patch to resolve an

2400
00:49:22.932 --> 00:49:24.853
issue. Our test, our

2401
00:49:24.853 --> 00:49:26.672
plans, our end-to-end tests

2402
00:49:26.693 --> 00:49:28.052
still got generated out

2403
00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:28.891
of our plan step.

2404
00:49:28.891 --> 00:49:29.952
This is super critical.
