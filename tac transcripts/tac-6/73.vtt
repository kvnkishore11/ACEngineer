1762
00:36:29.367 --> 00:36:31.365
patch directory. Okay. And

1763
00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:32.025
so again, we are

1764
00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:33.744
recording every large piece

1765
00:36:33.744 --> 00:36:35.003
of work that occurs.

1766
00:36:35.023 --> 00:36:35.663
The biggest piece of

1767
00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:36.882
work is the actual

1768
00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:38.081
implementation work. So we

1769
00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:38.641
always want to have

1770
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:40.139
a plan that details

1771
00:36:40.139 --> 00:36:41.838
exactly what gets done.

1772
00:36:41.838 --> 00:36:42.518
So this is the

1773
00:36:42.518 --> 00:36:44.396
output of our patch,

1774
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:45.456
right? So just to

1775
00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:46.615
be super clear, this

1776
00:36:46.615 --> 00:36:47.894
patch prompt, right? This

1777
00:36:47.894 --> 00:36:49.693
patch agentic prompt creates

1778
00:36:49.693 --> 00:36:51.231
this patch plan, super

1779
00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:53.110
simple, super concise. And

1780
00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:53.471
you know, you can

1781
00:36:53.471 --> 00:36:55.021
see it has detailed

1782
00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:56.599
the issue summary and

1783
00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:58.018
the solution. Okay. Not

1784
00:36:58.018 --> 00:36:59.456
correctly positioned, create a

1785
00:36:59.637 --> 00:37:00.876
button container to group
