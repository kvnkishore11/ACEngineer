WEBVTT

1125
00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:00.041
down and we're going

1126
00:24:00.041 --> 00:24:02.221
to resolve review issues

1127
00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:03.182
so this is super

1128
00:24:03.182 --> 00:24:04.122
powerful if we hop

1129
00:24:04.122 --> 00:24:05.394
in here you can

1130
00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:06.232
see we're going to

1131
00:24:06.232 --> 00:24:07.732
loop over all the

1132
00:24:07.732 --> 00:24:09.851
blocking issues, right? Specifically

1133
00:24:09.851 --> 00:24:11.130
the blocking issues. We're

1134
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.289
gonna create agent names

1135
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:13.028
to be passed in

1136
00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:14.328
to a reusable method,

1137
00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:16.626
create and implement patch.

1138
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:17.207
If we hop into

1139
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:17.946
this, we have a

1140
00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:19.506
shared method in workflow

1141
00:24:19.506 --> 00:24:20.605
ops, and you can

1142
00:24:20.605 --> 00:24:21.763
of course see where

1143
00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:22.844
that's stored here, ADW

1144
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:24.702
modules. Inside of this,

1145
00:24:24.782 --> 00:24:25.981
create and implement patch,

1146
00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:26.840
we are going to

1147
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.759
create a patch plan.

1148
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:29.579
And so the patch

1149
00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:30.519
plan looks like this.
