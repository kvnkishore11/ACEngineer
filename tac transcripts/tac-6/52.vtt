1221
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.220
in a plan, right?

1222
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:00.919
A path to a

1223
00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:01.518
plan. We're going to

1224
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:02.836
pass it in. And

1225
00:26:02.836 --> 00:26:04.236
just like our plan

1226
00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:05.933
from chore bug or

1227
00:26:05.933 --> 00:26:07.013
feature is going to

1228
00:26:07.013 --> 00:26:07.732
do that exact same

1229
00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:08.791
workflow. It's going to

1230
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.770
read the plan, think

1231
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.534
hard and implement. Okay,

1232
00:26:11.753 --> 00:26:12.713
so that's it. So

1233
00:26:12.713 --> 00:26:13.213
you can see we're

1234
00:26:13.213 --> 00:26:13.834
starting to get some

1235
00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:16.173
reuse of the compositional

1236
00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:17.952
pieces of our code

1237
00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:18.712
base. This is really

1238
00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:20.511
important. And again, we're

1239
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:21.571
hitting on that theme

1240
00:26:21.632 --> 00:26:24.231
of reusability and single

1241
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:25.872
agents with one prompt

1242
00:26:26.092 --> 00:26:28.330
with a single purpose.

1243
00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:29.371
Okay, so this is

1244
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:30.730
powerful after the implement
