00:21:29.182 --> 00:21:30.161
format look like? Of

1000
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:30.901
course, you can look

1001
00:21:30.901 --> 00:21:31.920
at the instructions there.

1002
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.779
Here's the report, right?

1003
00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:34.358
This is the interesting

1004
00:21:34.358 --> 00:21:34.858
part. We are outputting

1005
00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:36.458
JSON from our review

1006
00:21:36.557 --> 00:21:37.458
prompt. Of course, you

1007
00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:39.176
want to leverage types.

1008
00:21:39.217 --> 00:21:39.696
This is a key

1009
00:21:39.696 --> 00:21:40.955
leverage point of Agentic

1010
00:21:40.955 --> 00:21:42.435
coding. So everything we're

1011
00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:43.954
doing here has a

1012
00:21:43.954 --> 00:21:44.953
corresponding type. If we

1013
00:21:44.953 --> 00:21:46.354
just search for review

1014
00:21:46.354 --> 00:21:47.813
result, you can see

1015
00:21:47.813 --> 00:21:48.932
we have this type

1016
00:21:49.032 --> 00:21:51.451
exactly, right? Success, review

1017
00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:53.451
summary issues, screenshots, screenshot

1018
00:21:53.451 --> 00:21:54.990
URL, yada, yada, yada,

1019
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.190
right? And it contains,

1020
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.088
of course, a nested

1021
00:21:57.088 --> 00:21:58.568
type review issue. The

1022
00:21:58.568 --> 00:21:59.567
important thing to call

1023
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:00.228
out here is that
