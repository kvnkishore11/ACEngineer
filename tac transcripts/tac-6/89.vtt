2170
00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:30.400
over the place. We

2171
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.360
added export. If we

2172
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.679
go into markdown preview

2173
00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:33.559
mode here, we're also

2174
00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:34.159
going to get our

2175
00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:36.119
screenshots. Okay. So there's

2176
00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:37.039
a screenshot there and

2177
00:44:37.039 --> 00:44:37.978
we didn't rerun the

2178
00:44:37.978 --> 00:44:39.079
review step. So we

2179
00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:40.958
have our previous export

2180
00:44:40.958 --> 00:44:41.639
there. This is an

2181
00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:42.478
improvement we want to

2182
00:44:42.478 --> 00:44:43.239
make to our workflow.

2183
00:44:43.318 --> 00:44:44.798
That's great. If we

2184
00:44:44.798 --> 00:44:45.699
look through this, you

2185
00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:46.719
can see exactly what

2186
00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:47.659
was built, exactly what

2187
00:44:47.659 --> 00:44:48.878
was changed. All the

2188
00:44:48.878 --> 00:44:49.878
files here to support

2189
00:44:49.878 --> 00:44:51.777
this changes, modified, clear,

2190
00:44:51.777 --> 00:44:57.458
concise documentation, how to

2191
00:44:57.458 --> 00:44:58.137
use it, so on

2192
00:44:58.137 --> 00:44:58.717
and so forth. Right.

2193
00:44:58.914 --> 00:44:59.893
and allows us to

2194
00:44:59.893 --> 00:45:01.393
automate some of the
