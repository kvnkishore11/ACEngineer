589
00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:30.765
other composite workflows, the

590
00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:32.265
composed workflows look the

591
00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:33.825
exact same. In plan,

592
00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:35.183
build, document, we have

593
00:13:35.183 --> 00:13:36.303
that exact same thing,

594
00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:37.842
ADW underscore, and then

595
00:13:37.842 --> 00:13:39.142
we have plan, build,

596
00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:40.461
document. Okay? It's important

597
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:41.400
to note that you

598
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.139
need something to test

599
00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:44.919
document and review against.

600
00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:46.499
So plan and build

601
00:13:46.499 --> 00:13:48.239
are our essential methods.

602
00:13:48.278 --> 00:13:48.938
It's the work that

603
00:13:48.938 --> 00:13:50.138
allows the other three

604
00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:51.658
steps to even exist.

605
00:13:51.658 --> 00:13:52.658
Checker agent looks like

606
00:13:52.658 --> 00:13:54.116
it's setting up our

607
00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:55.417
database. Great. And there's

608
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:55.876
going to start the

609
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.716
server in the background.

610
00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:57.755
That looks great. We've

611
00:13:57.755 --> 00:13:59.255
covered plan and build

612
00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.775
in previous lessons. Let's
