717
00:15:59.385 --> 00:16:00.446
high level prompt that's

718
00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:02.085
moving into mid-level territory.

719
00:16:02.144 --> 00:16:02.703
We do have some

720
00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:04.342
engineering details here. Feel

721
00:16:04.342 --> 00:16:04.982
free to add as

722
00:16:04.982 --> 00:16:06.732
much detail to communicate

723
00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:07.793
exactly what you want

724
00:16:07.793 --> 00:16:08.572
done. You want these

725
00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:09.850
to mostly be high

726
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.971
level prompts because we've

727
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.908
templated our engineering already

728
00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:14.307
inside of our planning

729
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.866
prompts, right? Our slash

730
00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:17.166
tour slash bug slash

731
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.065
feature slash whatever class

732
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:19.705
of problem you want

733
00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:20.644
to solve. So I'm

734
00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:21.224
going to go ahead

735
00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:22.202
and create this. And

736
00:16:22.202 --> 00:16:22.982
now we have an

737
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.042
issue ID that we

738
00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:24.721
can use to kick

739
00:16:24.721 --> 00:16:26.139
off our workflow. As

740
00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:27.000
you can see here,

741
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.719
I don't have my

742
00:16:27.719 --> 00:16:29.398
dedicated agent environment. We're

743
00:16:29.398 --> 00:16:30.538
going to use my
