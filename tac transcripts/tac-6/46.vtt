1073
00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:01.023
here. That's the response

1074
00:23:01.044 --> 00:23:01.903
structure. And then at

1075
00:23:01.903 --> 00:23:02.682
some point here, we're

1076
00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:03.622
gonna parse it. Yep,

1077
00:23:03.622 --> 00:23:04.701
there it is, parseJSON.

1078
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:06.380
There's the Pydantic type.

1079
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.159
And then we're just

1080
00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:08.018
gonna return that, of

1081
00:23:08.018 --> 00:23:09.577
course. Great, so that's

1082
00:23:09.577 --> 00:23:10.596
review. We're gonna upload

1083
00:23:10.596 --> 00:23:11.616
and map the screenshots.

1084
00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:12.675
Nothing new there, we're

1085
00:23:12.675 --> 00:23:13.816
uploading to a bucket.

1086
00:23:13.816 --> 00:23:14.654
And let's see how

1087
00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:15.835
far our agent is

1088
00:23:15.835 --> 00:23:17.574
here. Build phase, okay,

1089
00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:18.273
so our agent is

1090
00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:19.093
in the build phase,

1091
00:23:19.093 --> 00:23:20.073
that's great. We can

1092
00:23:20.073 --> 00:23:21.652
always check the agent

1093
00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:23.471
ADW ID directory, right,

1094
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.250
agent slash ADW ID

1095
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.569
here, and understand where

1096
00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:26.989
they are in their

1097
00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:29.048
process. ADW review doesn't

1098
00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:30.028
exist yet, so they're
