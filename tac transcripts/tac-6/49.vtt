1149
00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:30.519
plan looks like this.

1150
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:31.038
If we open up

1151
00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:32.798
patch, you can see,

1152
00:24:33.066 --> 00:24:34.164
this right here, right?

1153
00:24:34.164 --> 00:24:35.464
Always collapse and just

1154
00:24:35.464 --> 00:24:35.845
look at a high

1155
00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:37.243
level, create a focus

1156
00:24:37.243 --> 00:24:38.423
to patch plan, resolve

1157
00:24:38.423 --> 00:24:40.103
a specific issue. So

1158
00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.182
we're making a surgical

1159
00:24:41.182 --> 00:24:42.281
change here. Follow the

1160
00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:43.181
instructions to create a

1161
00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:45.020
concise plan to address

1162
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.000
the issue with minimal

1163
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.798
targeted changes. And so

1164
00:24:47.898 --> 00:24:48.358
this is a really

1165
00:24:48.358 --> 00:24:50.137
powerful prompt. Of course,

1166
00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:51.077
we can't just do

1167
00:24:51.077 --> 00:24:52.336
everything with our ADW

1168
00:24:52.517 --> 00:24:53.736
first shot. We're going

1169
00:24:53.736 --> 00:24:54.276
to need to come

1170
00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:55.476
in and improve things

1171
00:24:55.476 --> 00:24:56.815
to patch issues. So

1172
00:24:56.815 --> 00:24:57.974
we have a concise

1173
00:24:57.974 --> 00:24:59.294
patch plan. This is

1174
00:24:59.433 --> 00:24:59.814
you know, to be

1175
00:24:59.814 --> 00:25:01.272
super clear, very similar
