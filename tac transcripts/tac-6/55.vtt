1295
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:30.411
update the existing PR,

1296
00:27:30.411 --> 00:27:31.490
which right now will

1297
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.790
just contain the plan

1298
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.930
for this, right? Thanks

1299
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:35.990
to the plan step

1300
00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:37.410
in our software developer

1301
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.130
lifecycle, AI developer workflow.

1302
00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:40.630
Review issue, come back

1303
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.470
up to the top.

1304
00:27:41.685 --> 00:27:42.664
Again, do a bunch

1305
00:27:42.664 --> 00:27:43.824
of reporting a lot

1306
00:27:43.824 --> 00:27:44.683
of this code just

1307
00:27:44.703 --> 00:27:45.282
to make it super

1308
00:27:45.282 --> 00:27:46.882
clear. It's just reporting,

1309
00:27:46.882 --> 00:27:47.381
right? Look at all

1310
00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:48.060
these hits on the

1311
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.220
sidebar here. This is

1312
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.419
just reporting. Most of

1313
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:51.218
this code is just

1314
00:27:51.218 --> 00:27:52.676
communicating what was done.

1315
00:27:52.817 --> 00:27:53.796
This is super important.

1316
00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:54.595
You always want to

1317
00:27:54.595 --> 00:27:55.694
be communicating the work

1318
00:27:55.694 --> 00:27:56.794
that you've done to

1319
00:27:56.794 --> 00:27:58.113
your review system so

1320
00:27:58.113 --> 00:27:59.530
you can easily review.

1321
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:00.471
And just to mention
