WEBVTT

2405
00:49:30.032 --> 00:49:31.692
And then we documented

2406
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:32.371
all the work that

2407
00:49:32.371 --> 00:49:33.411
was done and we

2408
00:49:33.411 --> 00:49:35.070
updated our conditional documentation,

2409
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.010
which tells all future

2410
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.771
agents inside of our

2411
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.269
bug, inside of our

2412
00:49:42.269 --> 00:49:44.041
feature, right, patch tells

2413
00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:45.539
all future agents running

2414
00:49:45.539 --> 00:49:46.898
plans for new work,

2415
00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:48.456
net new engineering work.

2416
00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:49.876
It tells them what

2417
00:49:49.976 --> 00:49:51.574
documentation they should read

2418
00:49:51.574 --> 00:49:51.974
in. If we open

2419
00:49:51.974 --> 00:49:53.132
up conditional docs here,

2420
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:54.572
it tells them when

2421
00:49:54.572 --> 00:49:55.590
to pull in pieces

2422
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:56.849
of documentation. And so

2423
00:49:56.849 --> 00:49:57.429
here we are, we

2424
00:49:57.429 --> 00:49:58.947
have completed the software

2425
00:49:58.947 --> 00:50:00.586
developer lifecycle. Back at
