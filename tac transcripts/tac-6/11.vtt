00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:31.762
to your developer workflows

214
00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:33.362
the workflows you take

215
00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:34.302
every day as an

216
00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:35.423
engineer you and i

217
00:05:35.423 --> 00:05:36.862
as engineers we operate

218
00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:37.641
one step at a

219
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.041
time and every step

220
00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:40.422
of engineering requires a

221
00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.773
different set of information

222
00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:44.112
a different approach a

223
00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:46.151
different perspective it requires

224
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:47.370
a different set of

225
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:49.889
tools and context okay

226
00:05:50.108 --> 00:05:50.869
think of a large

227
00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.187
feature you recently shipped

228
00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:54.247
even with in-loop agentic

229
00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:55.326
coding it doesn't happen

230
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:56.165
in one swing there

231
00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:57.845
are steps there's process

232
00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.483
there's planning building testing

233
00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:01.822
reviewing and documenting all
