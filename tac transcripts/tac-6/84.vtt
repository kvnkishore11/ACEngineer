2038
00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:00.077
You can see there's

2039
00:42:00.077 --> 00:42:00.717
the output from the

2040
00:42:00.717 --> 00:42:01.838
Git diff. It can

2041
00:42:01.838 --> 00:42:03.137
see all the changes

2042
00:42:03.137 --> 00:42:04.056
that we just made.

2043
00:42:04.157 --> 00:42:05.217
And now it also

2044
00:42:05.217 --> 00:42:06.536
has the spec file,

2045
00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:07.275
right? The plan file.

2046
00:42:07.436 --> 00:42:08.076
And now it's going

2047
00:42:08.076 --> 00:42:09.476
to just document for

2048
00:42:09.476 --> 00:42:10.335
us. You know, what

2049
00:42:10.335 --> 00:42:11.534
does the document step

2050
00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:13.514
do? What does document

2051
00:42:13.514 --> 00:42:15.025
do? What advantage are

2052
00:42:15.025 --> 00:42:16.085
we getting here with

2053
00:42:16.085 --> 00:42:16.864
the documentation set? So

2054
00:42:16.864 --> 00:42:18.623
documentation has two steps.

2055
00:42:18.643 --> 00:42:19.724
So after your agents

2056
00:42:19.724 --> 00:42:20.802
finish their work, they're

2057
00:42:20.802 --> 00:42:21.822
of course going to

2058
00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:23.661
create documentation. All right,

2059
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:24.282
so that's what this

2060
00:42:24.302 --> 00:42:25.820
ADW document does. And

2061
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.340
of course we can

2062
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.139
just search slash document

2063
00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:29.239
and we can find

2064
00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.878
the prompt exactly. What
