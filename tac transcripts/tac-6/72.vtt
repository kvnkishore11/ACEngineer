1734
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:00.202
that we could very

1735
00:36:00.202 --> 00:36:01.581
well add. And then

1736
00:36:01.581 --> 00:36:02.800
our agent would likely

1737
00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.400
read the image, have

1738
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.099
it in its context

1739
00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:06.318
window, and then be

1740
00:36:06.318 --> 00:36:07.257
able to improve on

1741
00:36:07.257 --> 00:36:08.318
this small issue here,

1742
00:36:08.338 --> 00:36:09.356
right? Because it was

1743
00:36:09.356 --> 00:36:10.856
really just that one

1744
00:36:10.856 --> 00:36:11.695
UI tweak that caused

1745
00:36:11.695 --> 00:36:12.675
the issue, right? Let's

1746
00:36:12.695 --> 00:36:14.014
see how our prompt

1747
00:36:14.074 --> 00:36:15.414
patch is going, right?

1748
00:36:15.414 --> 00:36:15.873
This is the whole

1749
00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:16.693
point of the patch

1750
00:36:16.693 --> 00:36:17.632
workflow. We have a

1751
00:36:17.632 --> 00:36:18.913
patch plan created. This

1752
00:36:18.913 --> 00:36:19.992
is getting created inside

1753
00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:20.952
of our specs directory.

1754
00:36:20.952 --> 00:36:21.452
And it looks like

1755
00:36:21.472 --> 00:36:23.431
our fix was just

1756
00:36:23.451 --> 00:36:24.570
finished. So our patch

1757
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.309
just completed. But you

1758
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:26.028
can see here inside

1759
00:36:26.028 --> 00:36:26.989
of specs where we

1760
00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:28.407
normally just have plans,

1761
00:36:28.507 --> 00:36:29.367
we now have this

1762
00:36:29.367 --> 00:36:31.365
patch directory. Okay. And
