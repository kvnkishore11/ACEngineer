2285
00:46:59.804 --> 00:47:01.103
we're saying, read this

2286
00:47:01.103 --> 00:47:01.864
to check if your

2287
00:47:01.864 --> 00:47:05.121
task requires additional documentation,

2288
00:47:05.121 --> 00:47:05.940
okay? If your tasks

2289
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.500
matches any conditions listed,

2290
00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:09.918
include those documentation files.

2291
00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:11.757
in the template, right,

2292
00:47:11.757 --> 00:47:12.856
in the prompt that

2293
00:47:12.856 --> 00:47:14.275
this meta prompt will

2294
00:47:14.275 --> 00:47:15.494
generate, all right? And

2295
00:47:15.494 --> 00:47:16.215
so this creates a

2296
00:47:16.215 --> 00:47:18.753
very, very powerful end-to-end

2297
00:47:18.932 --> 00:47:20.811
full feedback cycle between

2298
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:21.851
the beginning of the

2299
00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:23.409
software developer lifecycle with

2300
00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:24.670
the planning and the

2301
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.728
end with the documenting,

2302
00:47:26.728 --> 00:47:27.467
okay? So I hope

2303
00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:28.268
you can see how

2304
00:47:28.268 --> 00:47:30.027
this all changed together.
