2501
00:51:29.981 --> 00:51:30.820
solving. You want to

2502
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.278
encode how you would

2503
00:51:32.278 --> 00:51:33.797
review to answer the

2504
00:51:33.797 --> 00:51:35.157
question is what was

2505
00:51:35.157 --> 00:51:36.596
built, what we asked

2506
00:51:36.596 --> 00:51:37.775
for. Okay. And so

2507
00:51:37.775 --> 00:51:38.454
you want some type

2508
00:51:38.454 --> 00:51:40.112
of hard asset that

2509
00:51:40.112 --> 00:51:41.172
proves that what was

2510
00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:41.831
built is what you

2511
00:51:41.831 --> 00:51:42.851
asked for. So it

2512
00:51:42.851 --> 00:51:43.411
could be some type

2513
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:44.510
of report. It could

2514
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:45.568
be, you know, for

2515
00:51:45.568 --> 00:51:46.527
UI, like we have

2516
00:51:46.527 --> 00:51:47.288
here, it is a

2517
00:51:47.347 --> 00:51:48.327
image. It also can

2518
00:51:48.327 --> 00:51:49.989
be a video. You

2519
00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:50.429
want to take this

2520
00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:51.108
to the next step.

2521
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:51.768
What you want is

2522
00:51:51.768 --> 00:51:52.786
a live asset that

2523
00:51:52.786 --> 00:51:53.827
you can review that

2524
00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:55.364
proves that what was

2525
00:51:55.364 --> 00:51:56.224
built is what was

2526
00:51:56.224 --> 00:51:57.304
asked for. And this

2527
00:51:57.304 --> 00:51:58.523
is super, super critical

2528
00:51:58.523 --> 00:52:00.300
because it directly increases
