2304
00:47:28.268 --> 00:47:30.027
this all changed together.

2305
00:47:30.126 --> 00:47:30.846
This is a full,

2306
00:47:30.846 --> 00:47:32.445
complete loop. Our agents

2307
00:47:32.445 --> 00:47:34.083
are fully connected, right,

2308
00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:35.603
from planning to building

2309
00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:36.603
to testing to reviewing

2310
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:38.302
to documenting their work.

2311
00:47:38.498 --> 00:47:39.878
It's all connected now.

2312
00:47:39.918 --> 00:47:40.737
This seals the deal.

2313
00:47:40.737 --> 00:47:42.317
This connects them all.

2314
00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:43.197
So we have a

2315
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:45.277
powerful conditional doc, right?

2316
00:47:45.277 --> 00:47:45.856
This is a simple

2317
00:47:45.856 --> 00:47:47.436
pattern that advanced language

2318
00:47:47.436 --> 00:47:49.235
models like Claude, like

2319
00:47:49.235 --> 00:47:50.735
Sonnet, like Opus, like

2320
00:47:50.735 --> 00:47:51.755
models of the future.

2321
00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:52.356
They'll be able to

2322
00:47:52.356 --> 00:47:54.056
support, you know, looking

2323
00:47:54.056 --> 00:47:55.255
at this file, checking

2324
00:47:55.255 --> 00:47:56.295
the conditions and then

2325
00:47:56.295 --> 00:47:57.034
pulling in the file

2326
00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:57.914
if needed, right? They

2327
00:47:57.914 --> 00:47:58.715
won't just come in

2328
00:47:58.715 --> 00:47:59.914
here and read them.

2329
00:47:59.914 --> 00:48:00.494
And if they do
