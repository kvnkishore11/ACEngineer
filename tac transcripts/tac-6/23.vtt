490
00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:30.217
boot up Claude. I'm

491
00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:31.916
going to once again

492
00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:33.615
use Yolo mode and

493
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:34.173
I'm gonna fire up

494
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.293
the Opus model here.

495
00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:36.532
Just as before, we

496
00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:37.750
can run our all-in-one

497
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.230
set of command slash

498
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:40.369
install. This is a

499
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:41.847
great way to encode

500
00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:43.466
your engineering workflows for

501
00:11:43.466 --> 00:11:44.525
you and your team.

502
00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:45.085
If we open up

503
00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:46.504
slash install, we have

504
00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:47.942
one addition here at

505
00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.214
the bottom. we are

506
00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:50.153
going to set up

507
00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:52.711
some Cloudflare environment variables

508
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:53.350
so that we can

509
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.110
upload some image assets.

510
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.668
This is gonna be

511
00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:56.548
really important for our

512
00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:57.888
review workflow. This is

513
00:11:57.888 --> 00:11:58.746
a little teaser of

514
00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.125
what's coming next. Aside
