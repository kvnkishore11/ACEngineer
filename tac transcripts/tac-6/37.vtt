843
00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:30.809
our review system. Our

844
00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:31.569
review system is of

845
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.387
course GitHub issues here.

846
00:18:33.387 --> 00:18:34.287
If we scroll down,

847
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:34.786
you can see we're

848
00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:36.184
writing updates. Right now

849
00:18:36.184 --> 00:18:37.203
our agents are working

850
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.521
on the implementation plan.

851
00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:39.597
We find the spec

852
00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:40.758
file again, coming out

853
00:18:40.758 --> 00:18:41.478
of the state. We

854
00:18:41.478 --> 00:18:42.596
log and then here

855
00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:43.217
we have something really,

856
00:18:43.217 --> 00:18:44.737
really cool. We are

857
00:18:44.737 --> 00:18:46.936
initializing our R2 uploader.

858
00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:47.477
So we're going to

859
00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:48.817
upload images based on

860
00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:50.016
our review to a

861
00:18:50.016 --> 00:18:51.476
Cloudflare R2 bucket. This

862
00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:52.135
of course can be

863
00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:52.935
any bucket you can

864
00:18:52.935 --> 00:18:54.056
imagine. We just need

865
00:18:54.056 --> 00:18:55.276
this for publicly hosted

866
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:56.155
images so that we

867
00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.115
can attach them on

868
00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:58.234
our GitHub issues or

869
00:18:58.234 --> 00:18:59.515
on the PR, wherever

870
00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:00.035
you'd like to place
