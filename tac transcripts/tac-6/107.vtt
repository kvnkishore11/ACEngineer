2599
00:53:29.742 --> 00:53:31.023
you can achieve with

2600
00:53:31.143 --> 00:53:32.242
an agentic layer of

2601
00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:32.981
your codebase like

2602
00:53:33.021 --> 00:53:33.681
this. I'm gonna show

2603
00:53:33.681 --> 00:53:35.085
you how quickly you

2604
00:53:35.085 --> 00:53:36.164
can really ship in

2605
00:53:36.164 --> 00:53:37.043
our next lesson, okay?

2606
00:53:37.043 --> 00:53:37.842
It's going to be

2607
00:53:37.922 --> 00:53:39.420
absolutely mind blowing. I

2608
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.840
wanna really nail home

2609
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.998
the point that you

2610
00:53:41.998 --> 00:53:43.617
can't compete with this,

2611
00:53:43.717 --> 00:53:44.356
okay? So that's what

2612
00:53:44.356 --> 00:53:45.036
we're gonna do in

2613
00:53:45.036 --> 00:53:46.414
our next lesson. Every

2614
00:53:46.514 --> 00:53:48.612
lesson, every tactic, every

2615
00:53:48.612 --> 00:53:49.952
prompt we've run, in

2616
00:53:49.952 --> 00:53:51.090
loop, out loop, it's

2617
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.826
all leading up to

2618
00:53:52.826 --> 00:53:54.445
this big reveal of

2619
00:53:54.585 --> 00:53:56.023
Tactical Agentic Coding, right?

2620
00:53:56.023 --> 00:53:56.563
I'm gonna reveal the

2621
00:53:56.563 --> 00:53:58.503
secret of Tactical Agentic

2622
00:53:58.503 --> 00:53:59.902
coding. Understanding the secret

2623
00:53:59.902 --> 00:54:01.320
is mission critical to
