1452
00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:30.576
really excited to show

1453
00:30:30.576 --> 00:30:32.276
you what's coming next.

1454
00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:33.355
You can see here

1455
00:30:33.474 --> 00:30:35.154
R2 upload enabled and

1456
00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:35.773
we have this public

1457
00:30:35.773 --> 00:30:36.854
bucket that we're going

1458
00:30:36.854 --> 00:30:37.712
to have access to.

1459
00:30:37.792 --> 00:30:38.772
And you can kind

1460
00:30:38.772 --> 00:30:39.393
of imagine what's going

1461
00:30:39.452 --> 00:30:41.392
to happen next, assuming

1462
00:30:41.392 --> 00:30:42.951
that this workflow works

1463
00:30:42.951 --> 00:30:44.289
as intended, assuming our

1464
00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:45.390
agent ships the work

1465
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.049
that was designed to

1466
00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:47.148
ship. You never know.

1467
00:30:47.249 --> 00:30:47.828
Things can always go

1468
00:30:47.828 --> 00:30:49.367
wrong. These are non-deterministic

1469
00:30:49.387 --> 00:30:50.707
systems. But the goal

1470
00:30:50.707 --> 00:30:51.487
is to make it

1471
00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:52.166
so that we have

1472
00:30:52.166 --> 00:30:53.526
an entire pipeline of

1473
00:30:53.526 --> 00:30:55.365
agents that are checking

1474
00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:56.484
each other's work, making

1475
00:30:56.484 --> 00:30:57.463
sure things look good

1476
00:30:57.463 --> 00:30:58.943
and communicating to us

1477
00:30:58.943 --> 00:30:59.383
if that's not the

1478
00:30:59.383 --> 00:31:00.262
case, and then we
