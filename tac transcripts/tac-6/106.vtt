2573
00:52:59.329 --> 00:53:01.068
and document. This completes

2574
00:53:01.068 --> 00:53:02.447
the software developer lifecycle.

2575
00:53:02.527 --> 00:53:03.226
So in our next

2576
00:53:03.226 --> 00:53:03.927
lesson, we're going to

2577
00:53:03.927 --> 00:53:04.485
put this stuff to

2578
00:53:04.485 --> 00:53:06.045
work, right? I fully

2579
00:53:06.045 --> 00:53:07.103
realized that we have

2580
00:53:07.103 --> 00:53:08.282
been operating on this

2581
00:53:08.282 --> 00:53:09.181
kind of simple toy

2582
00:53:09.181 --> 00:53:10.860
example. That's fine, right?

2583
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.360
Obviously we're not focused

2584
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.039
on what is getting

2585
00:53:13.039 --> 00:53:14.885
built. There isn't, enough

2586
00:53:14.885 --> 00:53:15.646
time for me to

2587
00:53:15.646 --> 00:53:16.925
cover all the different

2588
00:53:16.925 --> 00:53:18.324
codebase types and

2589
00:53:18.324 --> 00:53:19.505
codebase applications that

2590
00:53:19.605 --> 00:53:21.385
every engineer watching this

2591
00:53:21.425 --> 00:53:22.403
is operating in. There

2592
00:53:22.403 --> 00:53:23.164
just isn't enough time.

2593
00:53:23.164 --> 00:53:24.623
So this exactly doesn't

2594
00:53:24.623 --> 00:53:25.463
matter. But what does

2595
00:53:25.463 --> 00:53:26.583
matter here, and in

2596
00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:27.342
our next lessons, we're

2597
00:53:27.342 --> 00:53:28.222
gonna showcase this. What

2598
00:53:28.222 --> 00:53:29.742
matters is the velocity

2599
00:53:29.742 --> 00:53:31.023
you can achieve with
