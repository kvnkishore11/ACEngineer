1638
00:33:58.481 --> 00:34:00.329
paste this in. That's

1639
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:01.328
the ADWID, you can

1640
00:34:01.328 --> 00:34:02.028
see it found the

1641
00:34:02.028 --> 00:34:02.948
state. Okay, so I

1642
00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:03.847
passed in the wrong

1643
00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:05.506
patch ID here. That's

1644
00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:07.644
PR15, it's issue 14.

1645
00:34:07.644 --> 00:34:08.625
It's gonna copy, paste,

1646
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.503
rerun against 14. There

1647
00:34:10.503 --> 00:34:11.382
we go. I did

1648
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.081
find the state, which

1649
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:12.641
is good, but we

1650
00:34:12.641 --> 00:34:13.402
need to run on

1651
00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:14.400
issue 14. There it

1652
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.679
is. For query results,

1653
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.559
make sure the download

1654
00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:17.418
button is just to

1655
00:34:17.418 --> 00:34:18.139
the left of our

1656
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.797
hide button. So what's

1657
00:34:19.797 --> 00:34:21.516
a potential reason why

1658
00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:23.235
this happened? First off,

1659
00:34:23.474 --> 00:34:24.934
I skipped the test

1660
00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:26.708
workflow. Okay, so, you

1661
00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:28.588
know, the UI test

1662
00:34:28.708 --> 00:34:29.347
very likely would have

1663
00:34:29.347 --> 00:34:31.146
caught this. Our review
