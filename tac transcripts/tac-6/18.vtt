371
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.450
it should be clear

372
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.948
what context it has,

373
00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:03.328
the available tools, and

374
00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:04.268
how the problem can

375
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:05.447
be solved with the

376
00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:07.287
focused leverage points it

377
00:09:07.287 --> 00:09:08.909
has available. Last but

378
00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:10.250
not least, one agent,

379
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.609
one prompt, one purpose

380
00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:12.688
has a very special

381
00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:13.927
side effect. You likely

382
00:09:13.927 --> 00:09:14.847
already know what this

383
00:09:14.847 --> 00:09:15.548
is. You're seeing it

384
00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:16.447
in this codebase.

385
00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:17.687
We get to commit

386
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:18.287
every one of our

387
00:09:18.287 --> 00:09:19.187
prompts, all of our

388
00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:20.427
workflows, which means we

389
00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:22.385
can easily improve them,

390
00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:23.265
okay? Since you're not

391
00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:24.845
stacking up many prompt

392
00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:26.404
calls from who knows

393
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:28.163
where, we can easily

394
00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:30.063
reproduce and more importantly,
