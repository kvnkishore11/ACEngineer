743
00:16:29.398 --> 00:16:30.538
going to use my

744
00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:31.177
device. We're going to

745
00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:31.995
let our agents run

746
00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:33.336
on this device to

747
00:16:33.336 --> 00:16:34.414
get work done so

748
00:16:34.414 --> 00:16:35.774
that we can analyze

749
00:16:35.874 --> 00:16:37.114
and understand what's going

750
00:16:37.114 --> 00:16:37.893
on under the hood

751
00:16:38.513 --> 00:16:39.711
in real time. So

752
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:40.292
in a new terminal

753
00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:41.331
here, we can run

754
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:42.931
UV run plan, build,

755
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:44.051
review. I'm gonna copy

756
00:16:44.051 --> 00:16:44.850
the relative path to

757
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.409
this paste and let's

758
00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:47.788
get our issue number.

759
00:16:47.788 --> 00:16:48.989
We have issue 14

760
00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:50.248
here and we don't

761
00:16:50.248 --> 00:16:51.227
need an ADW ID

762
00:16:51.307 --> 00:16:51.927
since this is a

763
00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:53.047
new workflow. One will

764
00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:54.307
be created for us.

765
00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:55.046
That should be good.

766
00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:55.686
So we're gonna fire

767
00:16:55.686 --> 00:16:57.941
this off. Now our

768
00:16:57.941 --> 00:16:59.639
workflow is running. So

769
00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:00.779
our agents have now
