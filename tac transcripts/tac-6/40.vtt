924
00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:00.625
doing. It's really simple.

925
00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:01.726
It is running the

926
00:20:01.726 --> 00:20:03.326
review prompt. You know,

927
00:20:03.326 --> 00:20:04.046
you can always just

928
00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:05.444
search and understand where

929
00:20:05.444 --> 00:20:06.005
all the prompts are

930
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.025
getting fired off. You

931
00:20:07.025 --> 00:20:07.904
know, search all slash

932
00:20:07.904 --> 00:20:09.723
command equals template request,

933
00:20:09.763 --> 00:20:10.943
execute template, right? It's

934
00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:11.723
all there in the

935
00:20:11.723 --> 00:20:12.903
codebase. Very easy

936
00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:13.722
to find. Let's look

937
00:20:13.722 --> 00:20:14.762
at the review prompt.

938
00:20:14.823 --> 00:20:15.902
Everything comes down to

939
00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:16.981
the prompt level. All

940
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:18.980
the ADW surrounding deterministic

941
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.580
code is just support

942
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.800
for the agents doing

943
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.700
the real work. So

944
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.839
what does review do?

945
00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:25.598
Of course, you know,

946
00:20:25.598 --> 00:20:26.398
we have a, you

947
00:20:26.398 --> 00:20:27.778
know, growing library of

948
00:20:27.798 --> 00:20:29.577
prompts that drive our

949
00:20:29.577 --> 00:20:31.498
agents behavior. And in
