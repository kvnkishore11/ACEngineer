666
00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:01.046
GitHub issues and get

667
00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:03.063
up PRS set remote

668
00:15:03.144 --> 00:15:05.663
paste, skip push, filled

669
00:15:05.663 --> 00:15:06.241
out some of these

670
00:15:06.241 --> 00:15:07.101
missing variables. So I'm

671
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.561
going to go ahead

672
00:15:07.561 --> 00:15:09.259
and say start application

673
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:11.957
again, already just handing

674
00:15:11.957 --> 00:15:12.697
off work. to our

675
00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:13.616
agent so it can

676
00:15:13.616 --> 00:15:14.197
do it. There's no

677
00:15:14.197 --> 00:15:14.855
reason for us to

678
00:15:14.855 --> 00:15:15.775
do this anymore. And

679
00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:16.794
so if we refresh,

680
00:15:16.794 --> 00:15:17.274
you can see our

681
00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:18.293
application is in a

682
00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:20.052
great state. Select five

683
00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.331
users, fire it off.

684
00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:22.211
And we'll of course

685
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:23.470
get five users here.

686
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.828
Fantastic. So our application

687
00:15:24.828 --> 00:15:25.849
here is back up

688
00:15:25.849 --> 00:15:26.707
and running. Let's go

689
00:15:26.707 --> 00:15:27.846
ahead and create a

690
00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:29.047
new GitHub issue. This

691
00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:30.365
is our prompt source.
