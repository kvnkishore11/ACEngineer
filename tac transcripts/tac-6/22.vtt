465
00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:01.134
codebase, notice how

466
00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:02.173
we're using this tactic

467
00:11:02.293 --> 00:11:03.113
throughout the codebase.

468
00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:04.552
One agent, one prompt,

469
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:06.309
one purpose, one, one,

470
00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:07.349
one. Let's dive into

471
00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:08.009
the codebase to

472
00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:08.587
see how we can

473
00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:10.905
build dedicated agents to

474
00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:13.224
review and document agentically.

475
00:11:13.563 --> 00:11:14.163
All right, so let's

476
00:11:14.163 --> 00:11:14.982
open up the terminal.

477
00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:16.142
Business as usual here.

478
00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:16.900
If we run LS,

479
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.201
we can see the

480
00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:18.958
previous five codebases.

481
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.097
Let's clone in the

482
00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:21.797
Lesson 6 repository, link

483
00:11:21.797 --> 00:11:22.615
available in your loot

484
00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:23.914
box below. I'm gonna

485
00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:26.000
CDN. and we're gonna

486
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.860
boot up your favorite

487
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.620
editor. I'm gonna use

488
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.798
code here. So right

489
00:11:28.798 --> 00:11:29.418
away, we're going to

490
00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:30.217
boot up Claude. I'm
