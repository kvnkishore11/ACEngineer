514
00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.125
what's coming next. Aside

515
00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:00.645
from that, it's the

516
00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:01.664
exact same workflow. We're

517
00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:02.424
gonna copy in some

518
00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:03.903
variables, reset the database

519
00:12:03.903 --> 00:12:04.822
and boot up our

520
00:12:04.822 --> 00:12:06.221
server in the background.

521
00:12:06.522 --> 00:12:07.520
Our agent is setting

522
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.421
everything up for us.

523
00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:09.360
There is no reason

524
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.099
to do this work

525
00:12:10.318 --> 00:12:11.538
by hand. You have

526
00:12:11.538 --> 00:12:13.356
agents use them. So

527
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:14.096
a couple things right

528
00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:14.696
away while this is

529
00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:15.774
running in the background,

530
00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:17.075
let's go ahead and

531
00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:18.274
take a look at

532
00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:19.274
our new AI developer

533
00:12:19.274 --> 00:12:20.732
workflows. This is the

534
00:12:20.732 --> 00:12:22.131
new agentic layer around

535
00:12:22.131 --> 00:12:23.172
your codebase. And

536
00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:23.772
in order for this

537
00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:25.410
to work, it composes

538
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.130
your prompts, okay? But

539
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.269
your workflows detail exactly

540
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:30.649
what the capabilities are
