71
00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.534
testing and reviewing? Why

72
00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:01.334
do we have this

73
00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:03.114
extra review step. Some

74
00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:04.712
engineering teams group these

75
00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:05.832
together. I think that's

76
00:02:05.832 --> 00:02:08.192
a massive mistake, especially

77
00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:09.132
in the age of

78
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.050
agents. Here's why. Every

79
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.170
step of the software

80
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.930
developer lifecycle can be

81
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.830
represented as a question

82
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.169
and an answer. For

83
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.368
instance, the plan step

84
00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:19.948
asks, what are we

85
00:02:19.948 --> 00:02:21.228
building? The build step

86
00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:22.508
asks, did we make

87
00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.086
it real? Testing says,

88
00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:25.407
does it work? The

89
00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:27.105
review step asks, is

90
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.409
what we built what

91
00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.568
we planned. And then

92
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:31.347
of course, document asks,
