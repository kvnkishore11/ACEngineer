00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:30.063
reproduce and more importantly,

395
00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:32.043
improve every single step

396
00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:33.482
down to the prompt

397
00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:34.543
level. This is big.

398
00:09:34.721 --> 00:09:35.662
While other engineers and

399
00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:36.902
companies are running big

400
00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.301
context windows that'll be

401
00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:39.220
blown away at the

402
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.479
end. You'll be running

403
00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.618
single focus prompts that

404
00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:44.157
you can pinpoint directly

405
00:09:44.157 --> 00:09:45.275
and improve. You've seen

406
00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:45.775
this in the code

407
00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:46.894
base. We just search

408
00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:47.913
for the slash command,

409
00:09:48.094 --> 00:09:49.114
open up the file,

410
00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:50.072
and we know what

411
00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:51.211
our agent can see,

412
00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:51.892
all right? When you're

413
00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:53.691
running in loop, right,

414
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:55.110
hands on the keyboard,

415
00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.707
you can quickly iterate

416
00:09:56.707 --> 00:09:58.246
and run your prompts

417
00:09:58.287 --> 00:09:59.287
so that they're battle

418
00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:00.686
tested to run out
