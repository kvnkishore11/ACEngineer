1889
00:38:58.887 --> 00:39:00.007
an engineer of the

1890
00:39:00.007 --> 00:39:01.427
past? Engineers doing it

1891
00:39:01.427 --> 00:39:02.666
the old way, hands-on,

1892
00:39:02.746 --> 00:39:03.405
back and forth, back

1893
00:39:03.405 --> 00:39:04.045
and forth, back and

1894
00:39:04.045 --> 00:39:05.523
forth. Okay. Let yourself

1895
00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:06.384
move up the stack.

1896
00:39:06.543 --> 00:39:06.983
Okay. I know this

1897
00:39:06.983 --> 00:39:08.342
is going to be

1898
00:39:08.342 --> 00:39:09.893
a challenging thing to

1899
00:39:09.893 --> 00:39:11.213
do, but it's critically

1900
00:39:11.213 --> 00:39:12.331
important that you are

1901
00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:13.490
a commander of compute,

1902
00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.469
hand off more work

1903
00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:15.568
to your agents, even

1904
00:39:15.568 --> 00:39:16.789
small stuff like this.

1905
00:39:16.827 --> 00:39:18.606
Don't bother yourself with

1906
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:19.286
this. Focus on the

1907
00:39:19.286 --> 00:39:20.445
high level, let yourself

1908
00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:21.684
scale up, use agents,

1909
00:39:21.684 --> 00:39:23.362
use compute. Okay. So

1910
00:39:23.443 --> 00:39:24.702
that's, that's reviewing. We

1911
00:39:24.702 --> 00:39:25.742
can patch, we can

1912
00:39:25.742 --> 00:39:26.340
get a full end

1913
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.380
to end review. And

1914
00:39:27.519 --> 00:39:28.239
you know, this is

1915
00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:28.998
something, this is a

1916
00:39:28.998 --> 00:39:31.157
concrete improvement. I can
