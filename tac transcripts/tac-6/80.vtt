00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:00.271
Direct to the left

1943
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.311
of the hide button.

1944
00:40:01.471 --> 00:40:02.369
So this means I

1945
00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:03.869
can ask myself, did

1946
00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:05.088
I have the original

1947
00:40:05.088 --> 00:40:06.847
request inside the plan

1948
00:40:06.847 --> 00:40:07.847
when it got implemented?

1949
00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:08.766
And so, you know,

1950
00:40:08.766 --> 00:40:09.507
we can just look,

1951
00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:10.846
right? We have all

1952
00:40:10.846 --> 00:40:11.965
the artifacts we need,

1953
00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.264
just let's just look,

1954
00:40:13.284 --> 00:40:14.284
right? So where is

1955
00:40:14.284 --> 00:40:15.023
that feature here? This

1956
00:40:15.023 --> 00:40:16.282
is 14 and it

1957
00:40:16.282 --> 00:40:17.481
looks like I did.

1958
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.402
So this was here

1959
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.320
and it looks like

1960
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.260
it is up to

1961
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.440
our review process to

1962
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.978
just be clear about

1963
00:40:22.978 --> 00:40:24.597
this. Okay. And if

1964
00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:25.516
we just search left

1965
00:40:25.516 --> 00:40:27.175
here, this was there,

1966
00:40:27.195 --> 00:40:27.934
right? So our agent

1967
00:40:28.074 --> 00:40:29.494
just missed this, right?

1968
00:40:29.733 --> 00:40:30.594
It just missed this
