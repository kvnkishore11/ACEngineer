2425
00:49:58.947 --> 00:50:00.586
developer lifecycle. Back at

2426
00:50:00.586 --> 00:50:01.266
the issue, we have

2427
00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:02.324
this really, really powerful

2428
00:50:02.324 --> 00:50:04.023
feature where our agents

2429
00:50:04.023 --> 00:50:05.342
are presenting the work

2430
00:50:05.342 --> 00:50:07.097
to us. Okay, this

2431
00:50:07.097 --> 00:50:08.695
is super, super critical

2432
00:50:08.695 --> 00:50:10.753
for agenting engineering work.

2433
00:50:10.793 --> 00:50:11.612
You don't want to

2434
00:50:11.612 --> 00:50:12.251
be in the loop.

2435
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:12.771
You don't want to

2436
00:50:12.771 --> 00:50:14.190
be on the ground

2437
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.349
and opening up the

2438
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:16.586
application. If you need

2439
00:50:16.586 --> 00:50:17.327
to, of course you

2440
00:50:17.327 --> 00:50:18.585
can, right? Go lower

2441
00:50:18.585 --> 00:50:19.403
level when you need

2442
00:50:19.403 --> 00:50:20.184
to, go into the

2443
00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:20.862
application when you need

2444
00:50:20.862 --> 00:50:21.922
to. But here we

2445
00:50:21.922 --> 00:50:23.260
had our agents just

2446
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.778
present us with the

2447
00:50:24.778 --> 00:50:26.173
proof that they have

2448
00:50:26.173 --> 00:50:27.632
reviewed the system. Now,

2449
00:50:27.811 --> 00:50:28.791
the review was wrong.

2450
00:50:28.871 --> 00:50:29.731
They should have caught

2451
00:50:29.731 --> 00:50:30.449
this. We did say
