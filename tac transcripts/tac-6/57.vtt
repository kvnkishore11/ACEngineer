1350
00:28:29.477 --> 00:28:30.296
times when you need

1351
00:28:30.296 --> 00:28:31.195
to come into the

1352
00:28:31.195 --> 00:28:32.255
loop, work in the

1353
00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:34.213
terminal, fire up instances

1354
00:28:34.253 --> 00:28:35.113
that you're prompting back

1355
00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.252
and forth. And it's

1356
00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:37.971
great for proving your

1357
00:28:37.971 --> 00:28:38.971
workflows and making sure

1358
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:39.910
that they work. So

1359
00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.609
like for instance here,

1360
00:28:40.609 --> 00:28:41.130
you know, in my

1361
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.749
install script, it looks

1362
00:28:42.749 --> 00:28:43.728
like my agent kicked

1363
00:28:43.728 --> 00:28:45.267
off start on its

1364
00:28:45.287 --> 00:28:46.526
own, which locked up

1365
00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:47.778
its loop. So this

1366
00:28:47.778 --> 00:28:48.298
is something that we

1367
00:28:48.298 --> 00:28:49.356
can improve in the

1368
00:28:49.356 --> 00:28:50.596
install command, right? Make

1369
00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:51.076
sure to be running

1370
00:28:51.076 --> 00:28:52.155
on the background process.

1371
00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:52.855
And to be fair,

1372
00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:53.516
I probably should have

1373
00:28:53.516 --> 00:28:54.694
just communicated that in

1374
00:28:54.694 --> 00:28:56.154
the inline prompt. Anyway,

1375
00:28:56.314 --> 00:28:57.153
so right now our

1376
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:58.433
agents are creating the

1377
00:28:58.433 --> 00:28:59.932
implementation commit and you

1378
00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:01.212
can always dial in
