WEBVTT

1504
00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:31.097
uploading images next. And

1505
00:31:31.097 --> 00:31:32.017
then we're going to

1506
00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:33.974
resolve any blocking issues

1507
00:31:33.974 --> 00:31:35.393
if any existed. Okay.

1508
00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.032
It looks like our

1509
00:31:36.032 --> 00:31:37.431
workflow has been completed.

1510
00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:39.249
Plan build review. So

1511
00:31:39.249 --> 00:31:39.729
up here we can

1512
00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:41.086
see something incredible. Okay.

1513
00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:43.505
We have images uploaded.

1514
00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:44.084
And so we can

1515
00:31:44.084 --> 00:31:44.663
click into this and

1516
00:31:44.663 --> 00:31:45.542
we can see right

1517
00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:47.273
on our public URL

1518
00:31:47.273 --> 00:31:48.353
here, we have that

1519
00:31:48.353 --> 00:31:50.692
down arrow. Okay. And

1520
00:31:50.692 --> 00:31:51.571
so there it is

1521
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:52.671
there. It looks like

1522
00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:54.049
it is off here.

1523
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:55.009
So our agent did

1524
00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:56.628
not obey this properly,

1525
00:31:56.628 --> 00:31:57.909
right? The export should

1526
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:58.548
not be in the

1527
00:31:58.548 --> 00:31:59.768
center there. And we

1528
00:31:59.768 --> 00:32:00.626
can run a patch
