1175
00:24:59.814 --> 00:25:01.272
super clear, very similar

1176
00:25:01.272 --> 00:25:02.750
to our chore prompt

1177
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.130
and our bug and

1178
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.608
our feature prompt as

1179
00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:06.867
well, right? So these

1180
00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:08.487
are a template meta

1181
00:25:08.487 --> 00:25:10.026
prompts. They're going to

1182
00:25:10.026 --> 00:25:11.804
output a plan that

1183
00:25:11.804 --> 00:25:12.824
we can then execute

1184
00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.561
after doing research. So

1185
00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:16.000
these are all dedicated

1186
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.880
prompts that run single

1187
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.378
agents that do one

1188
00:25:19.378 --> 00:25:20.157
thing well, right? They

1189
00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:21.557
have a single purpose.

1190
00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:22.516
Okay. And so you

1191
00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:23.855
could very easily see

1192
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:24.555
when you're writing these

1193
00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:26.566
small patches, that's very

1194
00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:27.865
different than a chore,

1195
00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:28.344
a bug, or a

1196
00:25:28.344 --> 00:25:29.482
feature, right? We're just

1197
00:25:29.482 --> 00:25:30.801
changing one thing. We
