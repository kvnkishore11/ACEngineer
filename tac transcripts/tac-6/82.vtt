1992
00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:00.315
clear here. Make sure

1993
00:41:00.315 --> 00:41:01.815
download appears to the

1994
00:41:01.815 --> 00:41:03.153
left of the X

1995
00:41:03.153 --> 00:41:04.554
icon, to the left

1996
00:41:04.693 --> 00:41:05.652
of the hide button.

1997
00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:06.972
So again, you wanna

1998
00:41:06.972 --> 00:41:08.532
be really careful with

1999
00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.510
the steps you have

2000
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.269
in your software developer

2001
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:13.001
Lifecycle, testing is there

2002
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:14.161
for a reason, right?

2003
00:41:14.161 --> 00:41:14.820
This is a great

2004
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.920
showcase of, you know,

2005
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:18.860
testing very likely would

2006
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.820
have caught this issue,

2007
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.739
right? If we look

2008
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:21.719
at our ADWs here,

2009
00:41:21.739 --> 00:41:23.199
remember we ran plan

2010
00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:24.858
build review. We completely

2011
00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:27.278
skipped plan build test

2012
00:41:27.378 --> 00:41:28.798
review, right? We could

2013
00:41:28.798 --> 00:41:29.878
have run this workflow

2014
00:41:29.878 --> 00:41:30.637
here, right? This is
