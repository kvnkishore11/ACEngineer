2088
00:42:59.523 --> 00:43:00.664
run, get diff against

2089
00:43:00.664 --> 00:43:02.483
main branch to understand

2090
00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:03.164
the change. Right? So

2091
00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:03.764
we're, we're using this

2092
00:43:03.764 --> 00:43:04.603
as a pattern, right?

2093
00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:05.282
You have the get

2094
00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.282
diff, you have your

2095
00:43:06.322 --> 00:43:07.422
plan. Now you can

2096
00:43:07.422 --> 00:43:09.121
understand what was implemented,

2097
00:43:09.121 --> 00:43:10.442
right? What was done.

2098
00:43:10.442 --> 00:43:11.074
So, That's what we

2099
00:43:11.074 --> 00:43:12.092
need for document. And

2100
00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:12.911
of course we have

2101
00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:13.891
this in the run

2102
00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:14.891
up to the document

2103
00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:16.110
workflow, right? So generate

2104
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.429
documentation. If we search

2105
00:43:17.429 --> 00:43:18.309
this, we're back in

2106
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:19.288
main. And of course

2107
00:43:19.288 --> 00:43:20.206
it's going to validate

2108
00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:21.007
that we have a

2109
00:43:21.007 --> 00:43:22.925
branch and this gives

2110
00:43:22.925 --> 00:43:23.864
us something to work

2111
00:43:23.985 --> 00:43:25.344
against, right? It gives

2112
00:43:25.344 --> 00:43:26.382
us something to document

2113
00:43:26.382 --> 00:43:27.981
against. So that's great.

2114
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.141
Documentation is pretty simple.
