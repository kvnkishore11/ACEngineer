00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:00.644
or the language model

283
00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:01.882
from complexity. What we're

284
00:07:01.882 --> 00:07:03.918
doing has many advantages.

285
00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:04.817
Let's run through the

286
00:07:04.817 --> 00:07:07.632
advantages of specialized one

287
00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:09.422
prompt agents. Why is

288
00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:10.500
this so powerful? You

289
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.100
free up the context

290
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:13.319
window. You give your

291
00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.798
agent the full 200K,

292
00:07:14.798 --> 00:07:16.259
500K, 1 million tokens,

293
00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:17.418
whatever you're working with,

294
00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:18.976
whatever Agentic Coding tool

295
00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:20.456
you have, and whatever

296
00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:21.435
time you're in, you

297
00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:22.495
give your agent all

298
00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:23.615
of the space and

299
00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:24.855
the opportunity to solve

300
00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:26.694
the one problem well.

301
00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:27.812
This is important as

302
00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:28.733
your codebase grows.

303
00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:29.812
To execute work, your

304
00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:30.692
agent will likely need
