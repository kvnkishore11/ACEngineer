134
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.058
we know the application

135
00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:32.717
contains work we asked

136
00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:33.937
for, thanks to the

137
00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:35.776
review AI developer workflow

138
00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:36.895
we'll explore in this

139
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:38.174
lesson, we can then

140
00:03:38.337 --> 00:03:39.518
Document the work that

141
00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:41.137
was done. Documentation is

142
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.157
simple, but how you

143
00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:43.955
document and when to

144
00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:46.115
include your documentation is

145
00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.074
the tricky part we'll

146
00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:48.313
solve in this lesson.

147
00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:49.693
Why do we document?

148
00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:51.372
Because inside the new

149
00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:52.872
agentic layer of your

150
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.331
codebase, documentation provides feedback

151
00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:56.871
on work done for

152
00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.631
future agents to reference

153
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.411
in their work. They

154
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.729
can operate and then
