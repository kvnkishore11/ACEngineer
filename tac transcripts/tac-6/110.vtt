2670
00:54:59.655 --> 00:55:00.974
of this, we ran

2671
00:55:01.175 --> 00:55:01.855
one prompt at the

2672
00:55:01.855 --> 00:55:03.793
beginning to add export

2673
00:55:03.793 --> 00:55:05.713
functionality to our tables

2674
00:55:05.733 --> 00:55:07.253
and our response queries.

2675
00:55:07.253 --> 00:55:08.032
And we had an

2676
00:55:08.032 --> 00:55:09.092
issue at the beginning

2677
00:55:09.112 --> 00:55:10.130
of this execution, right?

2678
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.670
We just ran that

2679
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:11.471
one prompt. We had

2680
00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:12.869
one attempt, right? This

2681
00:55:12.869 --> 00:55:14.289
is the optimal state

2682
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:15.369
for your attempt KPI.

2683
00:55:15.668 --> 00:55:16.429
We then ran the

2684
00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:18.027
patch that moved our

2685
00:55:18.027 --> 00:55:19.007
attempts up to two.

2686
00:55:19.188 --> 00:55:20.367
This is not good.

2687
00:55:20.407 --> 00:55:21.146
But on the bright

2688
00:55:21.146 --> 00:55:22.186
side, the work that

2689
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:23.706
we did ship with

2690
00:55:23.706 --> 00:55:24.782
that one prompt was

2691
00:55:24.782 --> 00:55:25.740
solid, right? We were

2692
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.257
able to export CSV

2693
00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:28.115
from our tables and

2694
00:55:28.115 --> 00:55:29.074
from the query result.

2695
00:55:29.353 --> 00:55:30.431
So size was good
