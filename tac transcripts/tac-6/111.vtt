2695
00:55:29.353 --> 00:55:30.431
So size was good

2696
00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:31.414
there. We did everything

2697
00:55:31.414 --> 00:55:32.112
we wanted to in

2698
00:55:32.112 --> 00:55:33.233
the right flow, right?

2699
00:55:33.233 --> 00:55:34.012
We did break our

2700
00:55:34.012 --> 00:55:35.072
streak because we needed

2701
00:55:35.072 --> 00:55:36.271
to call two AI

2702
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.471
developer workflows to ship

2703
00:55:37.471 --> 00:55:38.590
the feature. Okay. So

2704
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:39.789
our streak was broken,

2705
00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:41.028
right? Reset back to

2706
00:55:41.028 --> 00:55:42.407
one. Okay. And how

2707
00:55:42.407 --> 00:55:43.666
is our presence? Obviously

2708
00:55:43.666 --> 00:55:44.447
I'm operating here in

2709
00:55:44.447 --> 00:55:45.905
the loop to showcase

2710
00:55:46.005 --> 00:55:47.364
tactics of Agentic Coding,

2711
00:55:47.505 --> 00:55:48.284
but how was our

2712
00:55:48.284 --> 00:55:50.264
presence, right? Very quickly,

2713
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:50.744
we were able to

2714
00:55:50.744 --> 00:55:51.822
identify an issue thanks

2715
00:55:51.822 --> 00:55:53.282
to our review images

2716
00:55:53.282 --> 00:55:54.684
and then quickly patch

2717
00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.143
it. So our presence

2718
00:55:56.143 --> 00:55:57.742
was something like three.

2719
00:55:57.802 --> 00:55:58.222
We were there in

2720
00:55:58.222 --> 00:55:59.422
the beginning. We saw

2721
00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.481
this issue. We ran
