191
00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:00.473
want to call it.

192
00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:01.634
When you overload the

193
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.333
context window, your agent

194
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.432
has a harder time

195
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.110
focusing on what matters

196
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.850
the most, the original

197
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.288
task you asked it

198
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.648
to complete. And yes,

199
00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.226
generative AI companies, big

200
00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:13.747
tech, they're chasing the

201
00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.846
all-in-one, god model the

202
00:05:15.846 --> 00:05:17.026
super agent that can

203
00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:17.865
do it all but

204
00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:18.464
that's not what we're

205
00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:19.824
doing here we're solving

206
00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:21.524
real engineering problems with

207
00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:22.245
our boots on the

208
00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:23.845
ground with real work

209
00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:25.204
ahead of us there's

210
00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:25.944
a reason why they're

211
00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:27.744
called ai developer workflows

212
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.543
because they add compute

213
00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:31.762
to your developer workflows
