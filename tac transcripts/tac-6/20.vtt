418
00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:00.686
tested to run out

419
00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:01.345
the loop with your

420
00:10:01.384 --> 00:10:03.083
AFK agent system. By

421
00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:04.682
doing all this, you

422
00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:07.640
effectively create evals for

423
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.081
the agentic layer of

424
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:10.080
your codebase. Whoa,

425
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.899
whoa, whoa. Evals for

426
00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:12.878
your agents in your

427
00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.238
codebase. Yes, this

428
00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:14.876
is a big idea.

429
00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:15.876
We're not gonna explore

430
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:16.596
it much more here

431
00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:17.395
in TAC. We have

432
00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:18.355
other priorities that are

433
00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:19.953
more important, but individualized

434
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.732
agents, specific prompts, one

435
00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:24.091
purpose, you can evaluate

436
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:25.052
that. Okay, you can

437
00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:26.150
change the model. You

438
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.190
can add thinking mode.

439
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.129
You can change your

440
00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.528
Agentic Coding tool. You

441
00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.207
can rerun these over
