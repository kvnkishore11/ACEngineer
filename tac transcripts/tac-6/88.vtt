2142
00:43:59.534 --> 00:44:01.012
like chore, just like

2143
00:44:01.132 --> 00:44:02.211
feature, just like bug.

2144
00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:04.650
Our document is a

2145
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:06.369
template meta prompt. Okay.

2146
00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:07.489
So it has a

2147
00:44:07.489 --> 00:44:08.889
document format that we

2148
00:44:08.889 --> 00:44:10.547
specify. And here, of

2149
00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:11.407
course, once again, you

2150
00:44:11.407 --> 00:44:12.608
can template your engineering.

2151
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:13.086
How do you like

2152
00:44:13.086 --> 00:44:14.507
to document, right? How

2153
00:44:14.507 --> 00:44:14.885
do you like to

2154
00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:15.746
keep track of things?

2155
00:44:15.746 --> 00:44:16.425
I have a nice

2156
00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.105
template here you can

2157
00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:17.905
use to get started.

2158
00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:19.844
Of course, copy, steal,

2159
00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:20.824
make this your own,

2160
00:44:20.963 --> 00:44:21.443
use this as a

2161
00:44:21.443 --> 00:44:22.362
starting point. If we

2162
00:44:22.362 --> 00:44:23.521
look here, you can

2163
00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:24.021
see we have a,

2164
00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:25.460
just a great concise

2165
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.320
breakdown of what was

2166
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.581
done. Okay. So if

2167
00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:28.639
we just search for

2168
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.039
export, You know, you

2169
00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:29.699
can see this all

2170
00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:30.400
over the place. We
