540
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:30.649
what the capabilities are

541
00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.428
for your agents. Let's

542
00:12:32.448 --> 00:12:33.467
look at our new

543
00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:35.008
low-level ADWs that can

544
00:12:35.008 --> 00:12:36.187
be chained together. We

545
00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:37.206
have a brand new

546
00:12:37.386 --> 00:12:38.306
review. We have a

547
00:12:38.306 --> 00:12:39.822
brand new patch. and

548
00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:41.081
we have a document

549
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:41.640
and you can see

550
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.240
we have some composed

551
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.219
methods that put them

552
00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:45.078
together. So we're going

553
00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:46.278
to be running plan,

554
00:12:46.378 --> 00:12:48.177
build, review and plan,

555
00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:49.676
build, document. We also

556
00:12:49.676 --> 00:12:50.475
might just run the

557
00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:51.673
document step on its

558
00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:52.994
own after we fire

559
00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:54.273
off plan, build, review.

560
00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.032
What does this do?

561
00:12:55.032 --> 00:12:55.491
What are we gonna

562
00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:56.410
be looking at here,

563
00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:57.291
right? So all of

564
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.289
these composed workflows, they

565
00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:00.188
do exactly what you
