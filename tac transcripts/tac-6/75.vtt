WEBVTT

1810
00:37:29.407 --> 00:37:30.228
and I can use

1811
00:37:30.228 --> 00:37:31.186
these gigantic tools. We

1812
00:37:31.186 --> 00:37:31.686
can even do it

1813
00:37:31.686 --> 00:37:32.686
by hand if we're

1814
00:37:32.686 --> 00:37:34.005
being really dumb. We

1815
00:37:34.005 --> 00:37:34.744
both know that we

1816
00:37:34.744 --> 00:37:36.304
can fix this instantly

1817
00:37:36.304 --> 00:37:37.244
with a prompt. Okay.

1818
00:37:37.304 --> 00:37:38.342
That's not the point.

1819
00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:39.782
This isn't about you

1820
00:37:39.782 --> 00:37:41.465
anymore. Okay, this is

1821
00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:42.905
about your agents. It's

1822
00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:44.483
about teaching your agents

1823
00:37:44.523 --> 00:37:45.603
how to build on

1824
00:37:45.603 --> 00:37:46.922
your behalf, right? So

1825
00:37:46.922 --> 00:37:48.262
that it can be

1826
00:37:48.262 --> 00:37:49.722
about you again, okay?

1827
00:37:49.822 --> 00:37:51.222
Our hands, our minds,

1828
00:37:51.222 --> 00:37:52.840
remember tactic one, stop

1829
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.940
coding. That is going

1830
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.539
to start pushing into

1831
00:37:55.619 --> 00:37:56.759
some of these hands-on

1832
00:37:56.759 --> 00:37:57.998
pieces of engineering, like

1833
00:37:57.998 --> 00:37:59.737
stop these one-off low-level

1834
00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:01.097
prompts, okay? You really
