769
00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:00.779
our agents have now

770
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:02.619
taken over this repository.

771
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:03.538
We shouldn't be doing

772
00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:05.117
anything alongside them. They

773
00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:05.936
are running their own

774
00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:07.675
workflows designed to ship

775
00:17:07.816 --> 00:17:09.194
end to end. You

776
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.255
know, we're running plan,

777
00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:11.433
build, review while this

778
00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:12.613
is running. Let's understand

779
00:17:12.613 --> 00:17:13.653
the review workflow at

780
00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:14.392
a deeper level so

781
00:17:14.392 --> 00:17:15.791
that we know exactly

782
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:16.431
what's going on here.

783
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:17.330
Whenever you want to

784
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.349
understand one of these

785
00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.949
workflows, go right to

786
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:21.028
the main method. Let's

787
00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:21.588
run this top to

788
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:22.667
bottom and just focus

789
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:23.607
on the key pieces

790
00:17:23.607 --> 00:17:24.967
of information. All right.

791
00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:25.605
So we're passing in

792
00:17:25.605 --> 00:17:27.109
arguments. We're setting up

793
00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.170
our state. We have

794
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:28.789
to make sure we

795
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:30.108
have the right state
