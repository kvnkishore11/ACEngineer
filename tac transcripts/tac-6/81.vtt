1968
00:40:29.733 --> 00:40:30.594
It just missed this

1969
00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:31.532
detail. And so this

1970
00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:31.992
is something that is

1971
00:40:31.992 --> 00:40:33.012
just going to happen,

1972
00:40:33.052 --> 00:40:34.311
right? As agents improve,

1973
00:40:34.311 --> 00:40:35.230
as tools improve, this

1974
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.210
will happen less, but

1975
00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:37.568
this happened here. It's

1976
00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:38.748
also really important to

1977
00:40:38.748 --> 00:40:39.248
note. I don't wanna

1978
00:40:39.248 --> 00:40:39.927
keep harping on this

1979
00:40:39.927 --> 00:40:40.927
too long, but it's

1980
00:40:40.927 --> 00:40:42.505
important to note that

1981
00:40:42.666 --> 00:40:44.005
we did completely skip

1982
00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:45.603
the test step, right?

1983
00:40:45.603 --> 00:40:47.762
Which operates and validates

1984
00:40:47.762 --> 00:40:49.181
end to end, right?

1985
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:50.001
So we skipped the

1986
00:40:50.001 --> 00:40:51.400
test step. Our export

1987
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.659
functionality was not run,

1988
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.338
okay? And so you

1989
00:40:55.338 --> 00:40:56.077
can see here, we

1990
00:40:56.097 --> 00:40:57.117
do have that instruction.

1991
00:40:57.117 --> 00:40:58.536
Our agent was very

1992
00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:00.315
clear here. Make sure
