1023
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:00.228
out here is that

1024
00:22:00.228 --> 00:22:01.307
in a review issue,

1025
00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:03.106
we're looking for three

1026
00:22:03.106 --> 00:22:05.029
classes of issue. Okay.

1027
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.688
We have skippable tech

1028
00:22:06.728 --> 00:22:08.086
debt and blocker. You

1029
00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:08.925
want to make sure

1030
00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:10.224
you're accounting for things

1031
00:22:10.224 --> 00:22:10.844
that your agents are

1032
00:22:10.844 --> 00:22:12.063
going to find in

1033
00:22:12.063 --> 00:22:13.082
your work when they're

1034
00:22:13.102 --> 00:22:14.700
reviewing your code and

1035
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.519
your application. Okay. So

1036
00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.238
we don't want to

1037
00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:18.517
block on skippable or

1038
00:22:18.517 --> 00:22:19.415
tech debt. We want

1039
00:22:19.435 --> 00:22:20.994
to block on blockers.

1040
00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:22.232
Okay. So we're communicating

1041
00:22:22.252 --> 00:22:23.132
this to our agents.

1042
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.671
They will find something

1043
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:25.390
if you ask them

1044
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.382
to. All right, these

1045
00:22:26.382 --> 00:22:28.000
agents are very agreeable,

1046
00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:29.080
but they're also just

1047
00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:30.480
great at engineering. They're
