2064
00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.878
the prompt exactly. What

2065
00:42:30.878 --> 00:42:31.518
does this prompt do?

2066
00:42:31.518 --> 00:42:34.068
Document.md. You know exactly

2067
00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:34.748
where all these are.

2068
00:42:34.827 --> 00:42:36.387
This runs the following

2069
00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.606
instructions. So this is

2070
00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:38.704
a workflow. And of

2071
00:42:38.704 --> 00:42:39.583
course we can collapse,

2072
00:42:39.722 --> 00:42:41.440
generate concise markdown documentation

2073
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:42.840
for the implemented feature.

2074
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.858
This command creates documentation

2075
00:42:44.858 --> 00:42:46.096
in app docs. Okay,

2076
00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:46.456
so we have this

2077
00:42:46.456 --> 00:42:47.755
brand new directory here.

2078
00:42:47.755 --> 00:42:48.534
This is part of

2079
00:42:48.534 --> 00:42:49.552
the agentic layer of

2080
00:42:49.552 --> 00:42:50.271
our codebase. If

2081
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:50.891
you want, you can

2082
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:52.190
also throw this in

2083
00:42:52.385 --> 00:42:53.585
AI docs. I like

2084
00:42:53.585 --> 00:42:55.125
to separate these out.

2085
00:42:55.144 --> 00:42:56.224
AI docs for third

2086
00:42:56.224 --> 00:42:57.704
party app docs is

2087
00:42:57.704 --> 00:42:59.403
for your codebase

2088
00:42:59.523 --> 00:43:00.664
run, get diff against
