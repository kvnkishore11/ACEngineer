1528
00:31:59.768 --> 00:32:00.626
can run a patch

1529
00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:01.366
to clean this up.

1530
00:32:01.366 --> 00:32:02.306
This is a perfect

1531
00:32:02.306 --> 00:32:04.425
example of needing to

1532
00:32:04.484 --> 00:32:05.565
have a concrete review

1533
00:32:05.565 --> 00:32:06.384
step and improve the

1534
00:32:06.384 --> 00:32:08.243
review step. So, you

1535
00:32:08.243 --> 00:32:08.683
know, we can see

1536
00:32:08.683 --> 00:32:09.522
that and our agent

1537
00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:10.862
is reporting one click

1538
00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:11.741
feature export has been

1539
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:13.340
implemented implementation, blah, blah,

1540
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.240
blah, blah, blah, error

1541
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.759
handling all tests passed.

1542
00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:16.240
As you can see,

1543
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.838
here, there is work

1544
00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:17.538
to be done on

1545
00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:18.978
improving the prompt and

1546
00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:19.777
the workflow for this

1547
00:32:19.777 --> 00:32:21.076
review process, right? We

1548
00:32:21.076 --> 00:32:22.375
have our export button

1549
00:32:22.834 --> 00:32:23.992
right here and we

1550
00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:24.732
asked for it to

1551
00:32:24.732 --> 00:32:25.951
be right here. Okay.

1552
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:26.691
So let's go ahead,

1553
00:32:26.971 --> 00:32:27.589
put in a patch

1554
00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:29.009
for this. And, you

1555
00:32:29.009 --> 00:32:29.628
know, of course we

1556
00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:30.248
can, let's go ahead
