1378
00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:01.212
can always dial in

1379
00:29:01.212 --> 00:29:02.231
to the exact agent

1380
00:29:02.231 --> 00:29:02.932
that's running. You can

1381
00:29:02.932 --> 00:29:04.451
see it's prompt there

1382
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.090
and the raw output.

1383
00:29:06.131 --> 00:29:06.809
This is from the

1384
00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:08.549
stream call. when you're

1385
00:29:08.569 --> 00:29:09.828
running Claude Code with

1386
00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:11.948
the stream output mode.

1387
00:29:11.988 --> 00:29:12.528
And it's just going

1388
00:29:12.528 --> 00:29:13.227
to stream this. And

1389
00:29:13.227 --> 00:29:13.666
then at the end,

1390
00:29:13.666 --> 00:29:14.806
when it's finished, we

1391
00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:17.105
format into a nicer

1392
00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:18.923
JSON object. And so,

1393
00:29:18.983 --> 00:29:19.503
you know, something else

1394
00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:21.063
to note here, our

1395
00:29:21.103 --> 00:29:22.402
agent is running this

1396
00:29:22.402 --> 00:29:23.061
device. So you can

1397
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.441
see my branch has

1398
00:29:24.441 --> 00:29:25.799
changed, right? Our agent

1399
00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:26.980
is in full control

1400
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.858
over this system. I'm

1401
00:29:27.898 --> 00:29:28.939
not going to be

1402
00:29:28.939 --> 00:29:29.958
running anything right now

1403
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:30.857
because it has full
