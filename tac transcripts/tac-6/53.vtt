1244
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:30.730
powerful after the implement

1245
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.211
plan runs through. Let's

1246
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:33.390
close all these. We

1247
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.730
go back up and

1248
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.061
we have the patch

1249
00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:37.240
file and the implementation

1250
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.580
response. And of course,

1251
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.859
we're just doing additional

1252
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.180
logging, looking for success,

1253
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.439
looking for failures. And

1254
00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:43.078
if there's a failure,

1255
00:26:43.078 --> 00:26:44.199
we try again. Okay,

1256
00:26:44.358 --> 00:26:45.137
so that's what ADW

1257
00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:46.905
review does. Let's check

1258
00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:47.884
in with our workflow.

1259
00:26:47.944 --> 00:26:48.724
It looks like we

1260
00:26:48.744 --> 00:26:50.644
are still building. That

1261
00:26:50.644 --> 00:26:51.583
looks great. And whenever

1262
00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:52.002
you need to, you

1263
00:26:52.002 --> 00:26:52.843
know, you can hop

1264
00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:54.721
up to the issue

1265
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:55.761
or whatever your prompt

1266
00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:56.961
review system is, and

1267
00:26:56.961 --> 00:26:57.621
you can just see

1268
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:58.420
what's going on, right?

1269
00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.259
So you can see

1270
00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:00.059
we are still implementing
