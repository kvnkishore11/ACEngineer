name, review image directory.

975
00:21:02.152 --> 00:21:02.811
So we're being really

976
00:21:02.811 --> 00:21:04.031
clear, right? You can

977
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:05.351
just create variables at

978
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:05.971
the top of your

979
00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:07.550
prompts that'll then get

980
00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.570
used as long as

981
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.089
you're referencing them. What

982
00:21:10.089 --> 00:21:11.230
are we doing here?

983
00:21:11.329 --> 00:21:13.288
information dense keywords on

984
00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:14.249
the fly. These are

985
00:21:14.249 --> 00:21:14.948
variables that can be

986
00:21:14.948 --> 00:21:16.528
used and are used

987
00:21:16.707 --> 00:21:17.767
throughout the prompt, right?

988
00:21:17.767 --> 00:21:18.826
If we search for

989
00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:19.885
ADWID, you can see

990
00:21:19.885 --> 00:21:21.265
it getting used there.

991
00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:21.845
If we search for

992
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:22.785
agent name, of course,

993
00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:23.203
you can see that

994
00:21:23.203 --> 00:21:24.324
there. And of course,

995
00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:25.823
our review image directory,

996
00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:26.722
this is getting referenced

997
00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:28.122
directly in our instructions.

998
00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:29.182
What does the output

999
00:21:29.182 --> 00:21:30.161
format look like? Of
