2528
00:51:58.523 --> 00:52:00.300
because it directly increases

2529
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.938
your review velocity. And

2530
00:52:02.938 --> 00:52:04.657
that means your agentic

2531
00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:06.376
coding KPIs. And so

2532
00:52:06.376 --> 00:52:06.795
I hope you can

2533
00:52:06.795 --> 00:52:07.596
see that you want

2534
00:52:07.614 --> 00:52:08.835
to put all these

2535
00:52:08.835 --> 00:52:10.554
steps together. They're more

2536
00:52:10.554 --> 00:52:12.132
powerful together. When we

2537
00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:13.273
look ahead to what's

2538
00:52:13.273 --> 00:52:14.351
next, really important to

2539
00:52:14.351 --> 00:52:16.012
mention that the value

2540
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:17.532
in your ADWs isn't

2541
00:52:17.532 --> 00:52:19.331
in a single workflow,

2542
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:20.650
right? It's the power

2543
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.949
of combining workflows, having

2544
00:52:22.949 --> 00:52:24.648
them separate yet working

2545
00:52:24.648 --> 00:52:25.688
together. You want them

2546
00:52:25.688 --> 00:52:26.528
isolated. You want them

2547
00:52:26.548 --> 00:52:28.027
reviewable. You want them

2548
00:52:28.027 --> 00:52:29.668
improvable, right? And this

2549
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:30.766
is why we have
