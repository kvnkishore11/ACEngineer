304
00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:30.692
agent will likely need

305
00:07:30.692 --> 00:07:31.512
to pull in more

306
00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:32.911
and more context. As

307
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.610
agentic engineers, we have

308
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.509
three constraints, the context

309
00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.168
window, the complexity of

310
00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:39.208
our codebase, the

311
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.468
problem we're solving and

312
00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:42.567
lastly our abilities specialized

313
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.266
agents bypass two out

314
00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.206
of three of these

315
00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:46.586
all right model intelligence

316
00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:48.007
is not a constraint

317
00:07:48.047 --> 00:07:48.927
don't use this as

318
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:49.726
an excuse it will

319
00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:50.826
set you back this

320
00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:52.045
is a losing mindset

321
00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:53.165
okay when you free

322
00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:54.225
up the context window

323
00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:55.065
It means you can

324
00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:57.345
also solve bigger problems

325
00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:58.923
in your workflows. And

326
00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:00.223
it also simplifies your
