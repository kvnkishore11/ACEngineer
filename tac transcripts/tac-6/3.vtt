54
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.930
massively important for increasing

55
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.311
your review velocity. After

56
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.810
review, your agents will

57
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.010
then take a critical,

58
00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.230
often neglected final step.

59
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.030
They'll document their work.

60
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.924
This creates a complete

61
00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:44.103
software developer lifecycle feedback

62
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.362
loop that makes agents

63
00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:46.421
you run in the

64
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.820
future more performant because

65
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.060
they know exactly what

66
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.278
came before and when

67
00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.757
to include a given

68
00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:55.537
piece of documentation. So

69
00:01:55.557 --> 00:01:56.637
you might be thinking,

70
00:01:56.837 --> 00:01:58.875
what's the difference between

71
00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.534
testing and reviewing? Why
