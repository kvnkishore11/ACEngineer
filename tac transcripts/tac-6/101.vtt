2451
00:50:29.731 --> 00:50:30.449
this. We did say

2452
00:50:30.449 --> 00:50:31.570
to the left of

2453
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:32.748
the hide button. So

2454
00:50:32.748 --> 00:50:33.867
there are some improvements

2455
00:50:33.867 --> 00:50:34.987
to make on our

2456
00:50:34.987 --> 00:50:36.405
side, okay? I'm not

2457
00:50:36.405 --> 00:50:37.085
blaming the model for

2458
00:50:37.085 --> 00:50:38.643
this. I'm blaming my

2459
00:50:38.643 --> 00:50:40.663
skills. I'm blaming the

2460
00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:41.382
ADWs we have set

2461
00:50:41.382 --> 00:50:42.440
up right now, okay?

2462
00:50:42.601 --> 00:50:43.460
That's the problem here.

2463
00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:44.880
But notice how quickly

2464
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.338
we were able to

2465
00:50:45.338 --> 00:50:46.898
catch this with proof

2466
00:50:47.137 --> 00:50:48.476
of value, right? Agentic

2467
00:50:48.476 --> 00:50:50.114
proof of value. Review

2468
00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:51.873
answers the critical question.

2469
00:50:51.913 --> 00:50:52.811
Is what we built

2470
00:50:52.871 --> 00:50:54.130
what we asked for?

2471
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:54.989
Even when your agent

2472
00:50:54.989 --> 00:50:55.929
is wrong, when it

2473
00:50:55.929 --> 00:50:57.208
presents you with proof

2474
00:50:57.208 --> 00:50:57.748
that it thinks it's

2475
00:50:57.748 --> 00:50:59.027
right, you can quickly

2476
00:50:59.027 --> 00:51:00.286
say Yes or no.
