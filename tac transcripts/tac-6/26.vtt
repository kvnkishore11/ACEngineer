565
00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:00.188
do exactly what you

566
00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:00.988
think they do. They

567
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.408
run the lower level

568
00:13:02.408 --> 00:13:04.926
ADW, plan, build, review.

569
00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:05.557
And so if we

570
00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:06.716
just look through these,

571
00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:07.376
right, we look at

572
00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:09.076
ADW, we can see

573
00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:10.216
exactly what's happening here,

574
00:13:10.235 --> 00:13:11.434
right? We have plan

575
00:13:11.534 --> 00:13:12.634
running in a UV

576
00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.173
single file script build

577
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.352
and review. It's really

578
00:13:15.352 --> 00:13:16.893
important that these are

579
00:13:16.913 --> 00:13:18.471
standalone scripts. We can

580
00:13:18.471 --> 00:13:20.071
then compose them and

581
00:13:20.071 --> 00:13:20.990
make them run side

582
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.090
by side together. And

583
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.570
the ADW ID is

584
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.849
the thing that changed

585
00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:26.288
together the state of

586
00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:27.467
all of their work.

587
00:13:27.508 --> 00:13:28.008
So this is plan,

588
00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:28.986
build, review. All the

589
00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:30.765
other composite workflows, the
