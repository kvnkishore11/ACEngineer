326
00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:00.223
it also simplifies your

327
00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:01.961
workflows. We work one

328
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:03.041
step at a time,

329
00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:03.922
one agent at a

330
00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:05.021
time, one prompt, one

331
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:06.139
purpose at a time.

332
00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.980
All right. The compact

333
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.298
command inside of Claude

334
00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:10.437
Code, maybe this will

335
00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.117
be resolved in the

336
00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:12.697
future, but this is

337
00:08:12.697 --> 00:08:14.117
a bandaid fix. If

338
00:08:14.117 --> 00:08:14.975
your agent is running

339
00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:16.836
compact, it is losing

340
00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:18.973
information. Okay. So what's

341
00:08:18.973 --> 00:08:20.454
another key advantage of

342
00:08:20.454 --> 00:08:21.752
this tactic? One agent,

343
00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:23.312
one prompt, one purpose.

344
00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:24.432
It lets your agent,

345
00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:25.670
agent focus. This is

346
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.189
a very similar advantage,

347
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.910
right? This should be

348
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.949
relatable for you as

349
00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:30.007
an engineer. A focused
