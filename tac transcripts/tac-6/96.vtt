2329
00:47:59.914 --> 00:48:00.494
And if they do

2330
00:48:01.074 --> 00:48:01.974
scale up your model,

2331
00:48:01.974 --> 00:48:02.994
right? Use something smarter.

2332
00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:03.875
All right. This is

2333
00:48:03.875 --> 00:48:04.873
super powerful. This is

2334
00:48:04.873 --> 00:48:07.134
the conditional documentation. This

2335
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.637
gets updated. during the

2336
00:48:08.637 --> 00:48:10.376
document step, right after

2337
00:48:10.376 --> 00:48:10.996
the feature has been

2338
00:48:10.996 --> 00:48:12.315
completed, after all of

2339
00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:12.856
the steps of the

2340
00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:14.474
software development lifecycle up

2341
00:48:14.474 --> 00:48:15.873
to documentation. So we

2342
00:48:15.873 --> 00:48:16.873
know the code works

2343
00:48:16.992 --> 00:48:18.012
and we know that

2344
00:48:18.012 --> 00:48:19.092
the code is what

2345
00:48:19.092 --> 00:48:19.992
we asked it to

2346
00:48:19.992 --> 00:48:21.070
be. What was built

2347
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.851
is what we asked

2348
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:22.550
for thanks to the

2349
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:23.750
review step. After that

2350
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.829
runs, we document. Okay.

2351
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:27.027
And so all the

2352
00:48:27.027 --> 00:48:28.387
prompts are here with

2353
00:48:28.387 --> 00:48:28.987
all of these steps

2354
00:48:28.987 --> 00:48:30.385
together, with all this
