2721
00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.481
this issue. We ran

2722
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:01.400
the patch and then

2723
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.480
we reviewed it again.

2724
00:56:02.619 --> 00:56:03.918
Ideally, you want two

2725
00:56:03.918 --> 00:56:05.217
moments of presence, one

2726
00:56:05.217 --> 00:56:05.976
at the beginning for

2727
00:56:05.976 --> 00:56:07.137
your prompt input, one

2728
00:56:07.137 --> 00:56:08.255
at the end for

2729
00:56:08.255 --> 00:56:09.454
your review and your

2730
00:56:09.474 --> 00:56:11.074
PR merge. That's the

2731
00:56:11.074 --> 00:56:12.612
optimal case. As you'll

2732
00:56:12.612 --> 00:56:13.172
see in our next

2733
00:56:13.172 --> 00:56:13.931
lesson, you can actually

2734
00:56:13.931 --> 00:56:15.391
push that further. This

2735
00:56:15.391 --> 00:56:15.789
is where things are

2736
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:16.601
going to start to

2737
00:56:16.601 --> 00:56:17.222
feel and get a

2738
00:56:17.222 --> 00:56:18.661
little wacky as engineers.

2739
00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.179
In addition to the

2740
00:56:20.179 --> 00:56:21.699
secret of Agentic Coding,

2741
00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.599
we're going to move

2742
00:56:22.659 --> 00:56:24.097
even faster, just like

2743
00:56:24.097 --> 00:56:25.237
you can with individual

2744
00:56:25.297 --> 00:56:26.777
agent instances. You can

2745
00:56:26.777 --> 00:56:28.416
run entire AI developer

2746
00:56:28.416 --> 00:56:31.034
workflows in dangerous mode,
