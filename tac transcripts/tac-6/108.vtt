2623
00:53:59.902 --> 00:54:01.320
is mission critical to

2624
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.701
your success in Tactical

2625
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:03.719
Agentic Coding. It's something

2626
00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:04.420
that's been hiding in

2627
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.099
plain sight throughout TAC

2628
00:54:06.099 --> 00:54:07.677
and it'll upscale everything

2629
00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:08.257
we've done here in

2630
00:54:08.257 --> 00:54:09.077
TAC. It's a big

2631
00:54:09.077 --> 00:54:10.016
idea that you may

2632
00:54:10.016 --> 00:54:11.076
have noticed that starts

2633
00:54:11.096 --> 00:54:12.855
small and then scales

2634
00:54:12.855 --> 00:54:13.815
up. If you're thinking

2635
00:54:13.815 --> 00:54:15.153
ahead and you're applying

2636
00:54:15.153 --> 00:54:16.353
these tactics already in

2637
00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.393
your codebase, you've

2638
00:54:17.432 --> 00:54:18.952
realized the secret already.

2639
00:54:18.972 --> 00:54:20.150
With the five steps

2640
00:54:20.291 --> 00:54:21.090
of the software developer

2641
00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.842
lifecycle in TAC the

2642
00:54:22.862 --> 00:54:23.780
agentic layer of our

2643
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.920
codebase, we can

2644
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920
ship end to end,

2645
00:54:26.019 --> 00:54:26.559
back to back to

2646
00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:27.458
back, and we can

2647
00:54:27.458 --> 00:54:29.297
continue to improve our

2648
00:54:29.297 --> 00:54:30.516
agentic layer, right? We
