00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:00.471
And just to mention

1322
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:01.309
it again, you know,

1323
00:28:01.506 --> 00:28:03.124
It doesn't matter what

1324
00:28:03.124 --> 00:28:04.143
you use for your

1325
00:28:04.163 --> 00:28:05.321
review system, right? Maybe

1326
00:28:05.321 --> 00:28:07.059
you like GitHub issues.

1327
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:07.739
Maybe you want to

1328
00:28:07.739 --> 00:28:07.999
put it on the

1329
00:28:07.999 --> 00:28:09.676
pull requests itself. Maybe

1330
00:28:09.676 --> 00:28:10.257
you want to use

1331
00:28:10.257 --> 00:28:11.974
a entirely different resource,

1332
00:28:11.974 --> 00:28:14.073
right? Jira. I can't

1333
00:28:14.073 --> 00:28:14.811
imagine someone wants to

1334
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:15.651
use Jira, but you

1335
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:16.010
know, you might want

1336
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:16.930
to use something like

1337
00:28:17.209 --> 00:28:18.008
some Jira, some type

1338
00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:19.047
of task management board,

1339
00:28:19.047 --> 00:28:20.036
whatever you want to

1340
00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:20.882
do. do it your

1341
00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:21.901
way. All we're doing

1342
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:22.701
here, I'm not showing

1343
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:23.559
you how to do

1344
00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.319
it exactly. I'm showing

1345
00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:25.259
you what you can

1346
00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:26.438
do. Keep the Outloop

1347
00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.637
system in mind and

1348
00:28:27.637 --> 00:28:28.856
always know, of course,

1349
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:29.477
there are gonna be

1350
00:28:29.477 --> 00:28:30.296
times when you need
