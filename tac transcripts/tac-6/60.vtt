1426
00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:00.938
just happens all the

1427
00:30:00.938 --> 00:30:02.218
time now. right? We've

1428
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:03.936
templated our engineering and

1429
00:30:03.977 --> 00:30:05.375
our agents know what

1430
00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:05.816
to do with this

1431
00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:07.115
stuff, right? We're preparing

1432
00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:08.015
for, you know, that

1433
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.194
world where we are

1434
00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:10.034
just staying out the

1435
00:30:10.034 --> 00:30:11.094
loop. These are all

1436
00:30:11.094 --> 00:30:12.613
tactics that you should

1437
00:30:12.613 --> 00:30:13.751
be thinking as you're

1438
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:14.991
operating with your agents,

1439
00:30:14.991 --> 00:30:15.491
right? You should be

1440
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:16.570
thinking these things, right?

1441
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.810
Templating my engineering so

1442
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.369
that I can stay

1443
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.349
out the loop, building

1444
00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:20.568
systems that have one

1445
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:21.909
agent, one prompt with

1446
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:23.488
a single purpose. Okay.

1447
00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:23.887
If we look at

1448
00:30:23.887 --> 00:30:26.885
the agents, AWID directory,

1449
00:30:26.885 --> 00:30:27.625
we can see that

1450
00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:28.698
we are reviewing the

1451
00:30:28.698 --> 00:30:29.576
code now. I'm really,

1452
00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:30.576
really excited to show
