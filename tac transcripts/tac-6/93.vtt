2262
00:46:29.864 --> 00:46:32.342
all for conditional docs,

2263
00:46:32.442 --> 00:46:33.061
guess where this is

2264
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:33.960
gonna be? Guess where

2265
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.860
you're gonna find this?

2266
00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:36.978
Inside bug, inside chore,

2267
00:46:37.018 --> 00:46:38.936
inside feature, inside patch,

2268
00:46:38.936 --> 00:46:40.115
and even inside our

2269
00:46:40.115 --> 00:46:42.617
prime command, okay? This

2270
00:46:42.617 --> 00:46:43.976
is very, very powerful.

2271
00:46:44.077 --> 00:46:44.596
And if we go

2272
00:46:44.596 --> 00:46:45.596
into, let's say we're

2273
00:46:45.596 --> 00:46:46.855
fixing a bug, right?

2274
00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:48.693
It's inside the relevant

2275
00:46:48.713 --> 00:46:49.891
file section, right? Let's

2276
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:50.791
collapse everything else. We

2277
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.231
can get a high

2278
00:46:51.231 --> 00:46:52.670
level overview, right? Our

2279
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:54.050
bug is our template

2280
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:55.487
meta prompt that is

2281
00:46:55.527 --> 00:46:56.728
creating a plan to

2282
00:46:56.728 --> 00:46:57.666
fix a bug. But

2283
00:46:57.666 --> 00:46:58.206
if we look at

2284
00:46:58.226 --> 00:46:59.644
the relevant files here,

2285
00:46:59.804 --> 00:47:01.103
we're saying, read this
