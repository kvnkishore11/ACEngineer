WEBVTT

1859
00:38:29.085 --> 00:38:30.105
system, we were able

1860
00:38:30.105 --> 00:38:32.164
to quickly identify this

1861
00:38:32.164 --> 00:38:33.643
issue and just patch

1862
00:38:33.643 --> 00:38:34.422
it, just right away

1863
00:38:34.422 --> 00:38:35.842
patch it, okay? Now

1864
00:38:35.842 --> 00:38:36.601
we are running in

1865
00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:37.221
the loop, so we

1866
00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:37.501
had to do a

1867
00:38:37.501 --> 00:38:38.101
little bit of manual

1868
00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:39.699
work, but out the

1869
00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:40.320
loop, have to do

1870
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.378
is write, where was

1871
00:38:41.378 --> 00:38:42.418
that patch at? Yeah,

1872
00:38:42.577 --> 00:38:43.557
out the loop. I

1873
00:38:43.557 --> 00:38:44.737
just write this and

1874
00:38:44.737 --> 00:38:45.896
then the web hook

1875
00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:48.135
triggers the Outloop system

1876
00:38:48.135 --> 00:38:48.675
to just get the

1877
00:38:48.675 --> 00:38:49.974
job done. Okay. So

1878
00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:50.833
another reason you don't

1879
00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:51.773
open up the environment,

1880
00:38:51.773 --> 00:38:52.291
you don't do the

1881
00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:53.431
stuff yourself, let your

1882
00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:54.010
agents do the work

1883
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:54.550
for you. I know

1884
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.449
this is kind of

1885
00:38:55.449 --> 00:38:56.789
controversial, but do you

1886
00:38:56.789 --> 00:38:57.248
want to be an

1887
00:38:57.248 --> 00:38:58.309
agentic engineer or do

1888
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.887
you want to be

1889
00:38:58.887 --> 00:39:00.007
an engineer of the
