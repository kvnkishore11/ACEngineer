1711
00:35:28.358 --> 00:35:30.538
have this dash dash

1712
00:35:30.538 --> 00:35:32.454
vision. We're not operating

1713
00:35:32.454 --> 00:35:33.693
in vision mode. The

1714
00:35:33.693 --> 00:35:35.472
tokens aren't flowing through

1715
00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:36.871
the vision capabilities of

1716
00:35:36.871 --> 00:35:37.672
our language model. So

1717
00:35:37.692 --> 00:35:38.291
this is something we

1718
00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.152
could add to tweak

1719
00:35:39.152 --> 00:35:40.251
the workflow. I don't

1720
00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:41.050
like this because this

1721
00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.150
is outside of the

1722
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.831
ADW. So I want

1723
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:43.570
to kind of stay

1724
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.230
away from that and

1725
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.030
just keep general configuration

1726
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.289
here. Something we could

1727
00:35:47.289 --> 00:35:48.909
add here is inside

1728
00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:50.329
of the instructions for

1729
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:51.907
every image you take,

1730
00:35:52.748 --> 00:35:53.867
be sure to read

1731
00:35:53.867 --> 00:35:56.266
it in during the

1732
00:35:56.266 --> 00:35:58.925
review process. Okay. And

1733
00:35:58.925 --> 00:35:59.641
so This is something

1734
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:00.202
that we could very
