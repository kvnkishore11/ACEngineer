1098
00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:30.028
exist yet, so they're

1099
00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:30.867
still on the build

1100
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:31.946
phase. Great, that gives

1101
00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:32.426
us a little bit

1102
00:23:32.426 --> 00:23:33.166
more time here to

1103
00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:35.185
discuss the resolution, okay?

1104
00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:36.085
So we have a

1105
00:23:36.085 --> 00:23:37.025
max loop here, so

1106
00:23:37.025 --> 00:23:37.963
we're not gonna keep

1107
00:23:38.044 --> 00:23:39.064
fixing issues if our

1108
00:23:39.064 --> 00:23:40.503
agents just can't if

1109
00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:41.344
they can't of course

1110
00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:42.344
they're going to let

1111
00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:43.263
us know right and

1112
00:23:43.263 --> 00:23:43.784
then we will have

1113
00:23:43.784 --> 00:23:44.423
to hop back in

1114
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.702
the loop and fix

1115
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.083
our agentic layer to

1116
00:23:47.083 --> 00:23:48.502
resolve the class of

1117
00:23:48.502 --> 00:23:50.083
issue that caused the

1118
00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:51.643
review retry attempts to

1119
00:23:51.643 --> 00:23:52.363
run out we're going

1120
00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:53.942
to run review and

1121
00:23:54.042 --> 00:23:55.042
if there are issues

1122
00:23:55.163 --> 00:23:55.803
right so if we

1123
00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:57.303
have issues here we

1124
00:23:57.303 --> 00:23:59.321
are going to scroll

1125
00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:00.041
down and we're going
