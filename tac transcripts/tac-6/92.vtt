00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:00.199
this prompt helps you

2242
00:46:00.199 --> 00:46:01.978
determine what documentation you

2243
00:46:01.978 --> 00:46:02.858
should read based on

2244
00:46:02.858 --> 00:46:04.478
specific changes you need

2245
00:46:04.478 --> 00:46:04.878
to make in the

2246
00:46:04.878 --> 00:46:06.297
codebase. Review the

2247
00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:07.896
conditions below and read

2248
00:46:07.896 --> 00:46:09.876
the relevant documentation before

2249
00:46:09.876 --> 00:46:11.235
proceeding with your tasks.

2250
00:46:11.255 --> 00:46:12.635
So it's quite simple,

2251
00:46:12.635 --> 00:46:13.494
right? We're telling our

2252
00:46:13.494 --> 00:46:15.875
agents, read this documentation

2253
00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:17.454
given a condition. And

2254
00:46:17.454 --> 00:46:17.934
so you can see

2255
00:46:17.934 --> 00:46:19.134
here, our agent has

2256
00:46:19.253 --> 00:46:21.612
agentically updated this file

2257
00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.269
for all future agents

2258
00:46:23.269 --> 00:46:25.728
referencing this file, right?

2259
00:46:25.887 --> 00:46:26.608
And here comes the

2260
00:46:26.608 --> 00:46:28.266
magical part with agentic

2261
00:46:28.266 --> 00:46:29.824
documentation. If we search

2262
00:46:29.864 --> 00:46:32.342
all for conditional docs,
