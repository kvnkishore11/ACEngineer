2354
00:48:28.987 --> 00:48:30.385
together, with all this

2355
00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:31.425
work, right, where we

2356
00:48:31.425 --> 00:48:33.603
have agentic documentation, all

2357
00:48:33.603 --> 00:48:34.003
of this stuff is

2358
00:48:34.003 --> 00:48:35.362
happening for us. If

2359
00:48:35.362 --> 00:48:36.282
we open up the

2360
00:48:36.282 --> 00:48:37.302
issue, you know, open

2361
00:48:37.302 --> 00:48:38.449
up the PR, that's

2362
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:39.688
been created for us,

2363
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:40.867
that's been updated. You

2364
00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:41.168
know, a couple of

2365
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.487
prompts, we have 900

2366
00:48:42.487 --> 00:48:43.306
lines of code of

2367
00:48:43.306 --> 00:48:44.505
engineering work, but not

2368
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:46.105
just coding, right? You

2369
00:48:46.105 --> 00:48:46.983
know, 80% of coding

2370
00:48:46.983 --> 00:48:47.983
has been solved already

2371
00:48:48.003 --> 00:48:49.043
by language models, right?

2372
00:48:49.202 --> 00:48:50.043
AI coding is not

2373
00:48:50.043 --> 00:48:51.161
enough. It's not just

2374
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:52.541
about updating code, right?

2375
00:48:52.701 --> 00:48:53.900
Engineering is about much

2376
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.679
more. We can see

2377
00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:55.518
this, we know this,

2378
00:48:55.539 --> 00:48:56.099
and now we can

2379
00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.818
solve for this with

2380
00:48:57.916 --> 00:48:59.217
agents in our code

2381
00:48:59.217 --> 00:49:00.436
base, right? With the
