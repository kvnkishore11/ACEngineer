1663
00:34:29.347 --> 00:34:31.146
caught this. Our review

1664
00:34:31.146 --> 00:34:32.485
is just looking to

1665
00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:33.885
see if the feature

1666
00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:35.164
is there. We always

1667
00:34:35.164 --> 00:34:35.605
just have to be

1668
00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:36.344
ready for a model

1669
00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:37.724
just to blatantly make

1670
00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:38.802
a mistake like this.

1671
00:34:38.842 --> 00:34:39.503
And we look at

1672
00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:40.461
this result, right? Like

1673
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:42.021
placing this here is

1674
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:43.581
definitely something our agent

1675
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.420
should have caught. How

1676
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.639
could we have improved

1677
00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.338
this? There are a

1678
00:34:46.338 --> 00:34:47.239
couple of places to

1679
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.050
tackle, right? we're running

1680
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.228
the plan, build and

1681
00:34:50.228 --> 00:34:51.728
review. So we can

1682
00:34:51.728 --> 00:34:53.047
really attack any one

1683
00:34:53.047 --> 00:34:54.108
of these surface areas.

1684
00:34:54.108 --> 00:34:55.867
The review step really

1685
00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:57.007
should have caught that.

1686
00:34:57.007 --> 00:34:57.846
Okay, so what's something

1687
00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:58.505
we can do here

1688
00:34:58.505 --> 00:34:59.505
in the review step?

1689
00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:00.364
You know, something that
