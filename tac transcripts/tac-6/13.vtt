257
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.410
soon. The real engineering

258
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.581
still must happen. One

259
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:34.000
agent, one prompt, one

260
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.160
purpose. You want to

261
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.759
use specialized agents with

262
00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.377
focus prompts to achieve

263
00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:39.716
a single purpose. You've

264
00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:40.896
already seen this in

265
00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:42.115
the TAC codebases.

266
00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:43.214
No agent runs more

267
00:06:43.214 --> 00:06:44.754
than a single prompt.

268
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:45.434
Now this doesn't mean

269
00:06:45.434 --> 00:06:46.673
the prompt isn't large

270
00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.673
or the prompt doesn't

271
00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.112
do a lot of

272
00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:49.612
work, right? You've seen

273
00:06:49.612 --> 00:06:50.350
this in lesson three,

274
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.451
four, and five. We

275
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:52.389
have meta prompts. We

276
00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:53.350
have templates. We have

277
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.028
higher order prompts. These

278
00:06:55.028 --> 00:06:56.528
are not simple ideas.

279
00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:57.547
We're not doing simple

280
00:06:57.547 --> 00:06:58.466
sets of work. We're

281
00:06:58.466 --> 00:06:59.805
not sparing our agent.

282
00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:00.644
or the language model
