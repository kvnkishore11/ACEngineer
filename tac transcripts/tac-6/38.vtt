870
00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:00.035
you'd like to place

871
00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:00.734
them. And then we

872
00:19:00.734 --> 00:19:01.474
have the crux of

873
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.194
everything. Okay, so review

874
00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:04.874
runs two workflows. You

875
00:19:04.874 --> 00:19:05.534
know, we have two

876
00:19:05.673 --> 00:19:06.854
big steps in this

877
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.137
workflow. We run a

878
00:19:08.137 --> 00:19:09.537
review and then if

879
00:19:09.537 --> 00:19:10.576
there are issues, right,

880
00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:12.477
blocking issues, we then

881
00:19:12.477 --> 00:19:13.796
attempt to fix and

882
00:19:13.796 --> 00:19:15.455
remedy the issues agentically,

883
00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:16.335
right? You don't want

884
00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:17.775
your agents bothering you.

885
00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:18.755
You want to reduce

886
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:19.874
the number of human

887
00:19:19.874 --> 00:19:20.973
in the loop points

888
00:19:20.973 --> 00:19:21.713
there are in your

889
00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:22.993
workflow. As we know,

890
00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:24.232
tools will improve, models

891
00:19:24.232 --> 00:19:25.012
will improve. This is

892
00:19:25.012 --> 00:19:25.972
going to keep happening.

893
00:19:25.972 --> 00:19:26.571
You want to prepare

894
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:27.291
for the future. And

895
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.852
of course, we have

896
00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:30.471
tools to come into
