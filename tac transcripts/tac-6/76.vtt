00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:01.097
prompts, okay? You really

1835
00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:02.416
wanna extend that as

1836
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:03.217
much as you can,

1837
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:04.396
right? Teach your agent

1838
00:38:04.396 --> 00:38:04.835
how to do it.

1839
00:38:05.215 --> 00:38:05.755
We can, of course,

1840
00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:06.974
download this one row.

1841
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:07.934
Not a big deal

1842
00:38:07.934 --> 00:38:09.853
there, right? Download, download.

1843
00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:10.954
This all works great.

1844
00:38:11.052 --> 00:38:11.972
We can of course

1845
00:38:11.992 --> 00:38:13.452
open up. There is

1846
00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:15.032
our products in a

1847
00:38:15.032 --> 00:38:16.311
nice CSV file. The

1848
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:17.510
feature obviously worked. The

1849
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.289
important piece was implemented

1850
00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:20.088
for us end to

1851
00:38:20.088 --> 00:38:20.969
end. So this is

1852
00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:22.007
great, right? This is

1853
00:38:22.068 --> 00:38:23.148
the importance of having

1854
00:38:23.148 --> 00:38:24.387
review. Now, you know,

1855
00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:25.827
something really important that

1856
00:38:25.827 --> 00:38:26.485
I wanna call out

1857
00:38:26.485 --> 00:38:28.324
about this review process.

1858
00:38:28.324 --> 00:38:29.085
Thanks for our Outloop

1859
00:38:29.085 --> 00:38:30.105
system, we were able
