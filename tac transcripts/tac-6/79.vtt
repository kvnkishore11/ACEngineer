1916
00:39:28.998 --> 00:39:31.157
concrete improvement. I can

1917
00:39:31.157 --> 00:39:31.936
make to the review

1918
00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.177
process, right? And this

1919
00:39:33.177 --> 00:39:33.835
is something that you

1920
00:39:33.835 --> 00:39:34.476
would want to do,

1921
00:39:34.735 --> 00:39:35.474
right? For every image

1922
00:39:35.474 --> 00:39:36.215
you take, be sure

1923
00:39:36.215 --> 00:39:37.673
to read in, read

1924
00:39:37.673 --> 00:39:38.492
it in during the

1925
00:39:38.492 --> 00:39:40.192
review process. And then,

1926
00:39:40.192 --> 00:39:40.692
you know, something like

1927
00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:41.411
this, right? To make

1928
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:43.550
sure it matches the

1929
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.717
spec. and the original

1930
00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:47.197
request. Question I can

1931
00:39:47.197 --> 00:39:48.115
ask myself as I'm

1932
00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:49.016
building the system that

1933
00:39:49.016 --> 00:39:50.034
builds the system, do

1934
00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:50.835
I have the original

1935
00:39:50.835 --> 00:39:52.333
request? If you remember

1936
00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:52.934
right at the top

1937
00:39:52.934 --> 00:39:54.134
here, I have these

1938
00:39:54.134 --> 00:39:55.793
instructions, right? Place a

1939
00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.192
blank, blank, blank directly

1940
00:39:57.192 --> 00:39:58.291
to the left of

1941
00:39:58.411 --> 00:39:59.471
their respective thing, right?

1942
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:00.271
Direct to the left
