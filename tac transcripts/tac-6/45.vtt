1047
00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:30.480
great at engineering. They're

1048
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.680
great at coding, they're

1049
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.000
great at debugging. So

1050
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.660
if you ask them

1051
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.579
to find something, they'll

1052
00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:35.519
find something. You wanna

1053
00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.259
give them the tools

1054
00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:37.739
to delineate what is

1055
00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:39.417
important. Okay, once again,

1056
00:22:39.657 --> 00:22:40.778
we're templating our engineering

1057
00:22:40.778 --> 00:22:42.416
into our prompts for

1058
00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.497
agents. We're adopting our

1059
00:22:43.497 --> 00:22:44.396
agent's perspective so that

1060
00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:45.277
they know what they

1061
00:22:45.277 --> 00:22:46.355
need to do at

1062
00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:47.256
the right time. Okay,

1063
00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:48.615
so that's that, and

1064
00:22:48.615 --> 00:22:49.694
this is the review

1065
00:22:49.694 --> 00:22:51.214
prompt. So it's going

1066
00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:52.015
to look through the

1067
00:22:52.015 --> 00:22:53.233
application. It's going to

1068
00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:54.493
review the code done.

1069
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.449
check it against the

1070
00:22:55.449 --> 00:22:57.527
spec and return this

1071
00:22:57.527 --> 00:22:59.425
object structure. And so

1072
00:22:59.445 --> 00:22:59.984
that's what we get

1073
00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:01.023
here. That's the response
