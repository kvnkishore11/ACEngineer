00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:00.364
You know, something that

1690
00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.824
is just completely missing

1691
00:35:01.824 --> 00:35:02.844
here. Our agent is

1692
00:35:02.844 --> 00:35:04.083
capturing these images and

1693
00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:04.864
something that we can

1694
00:35:04.864 --> 00:35:05.722
add here that could

1695
00:35:05.722 --> 00:35:06.983
be really, really important.

1696
00:35:07.143 --> 00:35:09.862
The actual screenshots never

1697
00:35:09.862 --> 00:35:11.021
make it into the

1698
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:12.141
agent. To be super

1699
00:35:12.141 --> 00:35:13.081
clear here, our agent

1700
00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:14.920
is operating Playwright. If

1701
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.521
you look at the

1702
00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:17.820
root directory here, we

1703
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.880
have this .mcp.json and

1704
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.960
we have a simple

1705
00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:21.719
Playwright configuration that allows

1706
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.518
our agents to operate

1707
00:35:23.518 --> 00:35:25.219
Playwright. And so something

1708
00:35:25.219 --> 00:35:26.059
that we missed here

1709
00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:26.898
and something that isn't

1710
00:35:26.898 --> 00:35:28.358
activated is we don't

1711
00:35:28.358 --> 00:35:30.538
have this dash dash
