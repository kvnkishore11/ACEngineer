896
00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:30.471
tools to come into

897
00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:31.451
this workflow and to

898
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:32.971
understand what went wrong

899
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:33.650
if we need to

900
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.069
and to apply patch

901
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.049
fixes, which is what

902
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.990
the ADW patch is

903
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.329
for. Okay, but always

904
00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:39.249
lean toward the future.

905
00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:40.288
We're not here to

906
00:19:40.348 --> 00:19:41.249
stay in the loop

907
00:19:41.249 --> 00:19:42.608
forever, right? They're called

908
00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:43.888
Outloop systems for a

909
00:19:43.888 --> 00:19:44.709
reason. You want your

910
00:19:44.709 --> 00:19:45.528
agent shipping end to

911
00:19:45.528 --> 00:19:46.448
end. And if something

912
00:19:46.448 --> 00:19:47.827
goes wrong, you fix

913
00:19:47.827 --> 00:19:48.607
the end to end

914
00:19:48.607 --> 00:19:50.087
portion, not the thing

915
00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:51.127
that went wrong, right?

916
00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:51.847
This is the tricky

917
00:19:51.847 --> 00:19:52.428
part. And this is

918
00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:53.906
the important transition we

919
00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:54.446
and I have to

920
00:19:54.446 --> 00:19:56.426
make as agentic engineers.

921
00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:57.906
Okay, but let's look

922
00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:58.727
into the run review

923
00:19:58.727 --> 00:19:59.526
and guess what it's

924
00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:00.625
doing. It's really simple.
