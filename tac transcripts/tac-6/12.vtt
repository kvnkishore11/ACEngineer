233
00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:01.822
reviewing and documenting all

234
00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:02.262
right so we're breaking

235
00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:03.553
these down step by

236
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:04.434
step. This is the

237
00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:05.374
power of the AI

238
00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:06.593
developer workflow. You get

239
00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:08.233
to now encode this,

240
00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:08.833
right? You get to

241
00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:10.492
template your engineering and

242
00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:11.392
hand off the work

243
00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:12.452
to your agents. You

244
00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:13.591
can teach your agents

245
00:06:13.632 --> 00:06:14.831
how to operate your

246
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:15.971
codebase to solve

247
00:06:16.172 --> 00:06:18.031
your problems. Real engineering

248
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:20.610
requires real developer workflows,

249
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.391
not some pie in

250
00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:22.951
the sky God model

251
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:23.771
that claims to do

252
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:24.891
it all. And, you

253
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:25.670
know, let me just

254
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.670
spoil it for you.

255
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:27.790
They won't, it's not

256
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.810
here. It's not coming

257
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.410
soon. The real engineering
