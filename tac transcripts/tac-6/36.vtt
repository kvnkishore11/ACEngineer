818
00:17:58.989 --> 00:18:00.487
exists from the state

819
00:18:00.487 --> 00:18:01.394
file, So, you know,

820
00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:02.313
whenever you see state

821
00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.271
that is exactly what's

822
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.871
happening here. We're checking

823
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:06.089
our environment variables, getting

824
00:18:06.089 --> 00:18:07.229
the GitHub repo from

825
00:18:07.229 --> 00:18:08.508
the state object and

826
00:18:08.508 --> 00:18:09.767
then we're validating, right?

827
00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:11.226
You can't review if

828
00:18:11.226 --> 00:18:11.885
you don't have work

829
00:18:11.885 --> 00:18:12.785
to review and you

830
00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:13.844
do work on new

831
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:14.923
branches. So you can

832
00:18:14.923 --> 00:18:15.563
see here, we're just

833
00:18:15.583 --> 00:18:16.781
validating the branch, making

834
00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:17.281
sure we have that

835
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:18.240
checked out. And then

836
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.240
a lot of all

837
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.019
the code here is

838
00:18:20.019 --> 00:18:22.038
just logging and communicating

839
00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:23.817
to our Peter review

840
00:18:23.817 --> 00:18:24.976
system. Remember the Peter

841
00:18:24.976 --> 00:18:26.794
framework, we have prompt

842
00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:29.471
input, trigger environment and

843
00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:30.809
our review system. Our
