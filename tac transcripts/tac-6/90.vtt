2194
00:44:59.893 --> 00:45:01.393
automate some of the

2195
00:45:01.393 --> 00:45:03.092
work that engineers just

2196
00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:04.590
don't do or work

2197
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.371
that chews up a

2198
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:06.449
lot of engineering time,

2199
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.768
right? Agentic documentation, agentic

2200
00:45:08.768 --> 00:45:10.407
review is ultra, ultra

2201
00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.786
powerful. And now we

2202
00:45:11.786 --> 00:45:12.367
have this piece of

2203
00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:13.945
documentation, okay? So this

2204
00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:14.826
is powerful, but this

2205
00:45:14.826 --> 00:45:15.684
is not all that

2206
00:45:15.684 --> 00:45:16.565
was done. Remember in

2207
00:45:16.565 --> 00:45:17.724
the beginning, I mentioned

2208
00:45:17.724 --> 00:45:18.603
that there are two

2209
00:45:18.603 --> 00:45:20.222
steps to documentation, creating

2210
00:45:20.222 --> 00:45:21.302
documentation for the work

2211
00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:22.461
you've done and then

2212
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:24.201
there's knowing when and

2213
00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:25.501
how to pull in

2214
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:27.139
the documentation. So if

2215
00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:27.519
we open up the

2216
00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:28.858
documentation prompt here, not

2217
00:45:28.858 --> 00:45:29.358
only is it a

2218
00:45:29.358 --> 00:45:30.818
template meta prompt, but
