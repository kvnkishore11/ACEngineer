00:36:59.637 --> 00:37:00.876
button container to group

1786
00:37:00.956 --> 00:37:02.614
export and hide right

1787
00:37:02.614 --> 00:37:03.733
side of the results

1788
00:37:03.733 --> 00:37:04.871
header. Okay. And so

1789
00:37:04.871 --> 00:37:05.271
we should be able

1790
00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:05.871
to just, you know,

1791
00:37:05.871 --> 00:37:08.469
refresh, select random product.

1792
00:37:09.268 --> 00:37:10.327
And now we should

1793
00:37:10.327 --> 00:37:11.757
see this. There we

1794
00:37:11.757 --> 00:37:12.936
go. Export is now

1795
00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:13.817
right next to hide.

1796
00:37:13.896 --> 00:37:14.536
And you know, I

1797
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.614
know I absolutely can

1798
00:37:16.614 --> 00:37:17.934
just hear a couple

1799
00:37:17.934 --> 00:37:18.793
of engineers watching this

1800
00:37:18.793 --> 00:37:19.833
now. Why didn't you

1801
00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:20.413
just do that by

1802
00:37:20.413 --> 00:37:21.393
hand? You're missing the

1803
00:37:21.393 --> 00:37:22.632
point. Okay. The whole

1804
00:37:22.632 --> 00:37:23.751
point here is that

1805
00:37:23.751 --> 00:37:24.311
we are putting in

1806
00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:25.449
the effort to build

1807
00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:26.530
the system that builds

1808
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.949
the system. Yes. Like

1809
00:37:28.228 --> 00:37:29.407
I know that you

1810
00:37:29.407 --> 00:37:30.228
and I can use
