2476
00:50:59.027 --> 00:51:00.286
say Yes or no.

2477
00:51:00.465 --> 00:51:01.204
Not all engineers are

2478
00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:02.364
working on front-end systems.

2479
00:51:02.405 --> 00:51:03.284
If you're building language

2480
00:51:03.284 --> 00:51:04.782
models, data analytics work,

2481
00:51:04.782 --> 00:51:06.481
building scikit models, old

2482
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:07.742
school scikit models, right?

2483
00:51:07.742 --> 00:51:09.181
Classification models. Maybe you're

2484
00:51:09.181 --> 00:51:10.460
doing some rapid prototyping,

2485
00:51:10.579 --> 00:51:11.880
right? Whatever you would

2486
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.739
do to review that

2487
00:51:13.739 --> 00:51:14.838
the thing is what

2488
00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.177
you asked for, whatever

2489
00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:17.157
steps you would take,

2490
00:51:17.217 --> 00:51:17.936
this is what you're

2491
00:51:17.936 --> 00:51:19.476
going to embed into

2492
00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:20.755
your review step. This

2493
00:51:20.755 --> 00:51:21.614
is what the review

2494
00:51:21.614 --> 00:51:22.813
step does for you.

2495
00:51:22.945 --> 00:51:23.824
Okay. This is the

2496
00:51:23.824 --> 00:51:25.043
review step. This is

2497
00:51:25.043 --> 00:51:26.543
ADW review. You want

2498
00:51:26.563 --> 00:51:28.322
to encode for this

2499
00:51:28.342 --> 00:51:29.300
specific codebase for

2500
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:29.981
the problem that you're

2501
00:51:29.981 --> 00:51:30.820
solving. You want to
