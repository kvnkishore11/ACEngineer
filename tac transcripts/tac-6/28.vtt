612
00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:00.775
in previous lessons. Let's

613
00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:01.934
go ahead and jump

614
00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:02.674
right in to the

615
00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:04.294
review step. Open up

616
00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:05.533
our review AI developer

617
00:14:05.533 --> 00:14:06.974
workflow and let's understand

618
00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:07.634
what's going on here.

619
00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:09.133
So there's no excuse

620
00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:11.133
for having poor documentation.

621
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:11.533
So at the top

622
00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:12.312
of this single file

623
00:14:12.312 --> 00:14:13.672
script, we have clear,

624
00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:15.272
concise, documentation. What's the

625
00:14:15.272 --> 00:14:16.671
workflow? Find the spec

626
00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:17.571
from the current branch

627
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.270
review implementation against the

628
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.230
spec. Right. So we

629
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.269
need a plan and

630
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.929
we need a diff

631
00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:24.750
capture screenshots of critical

632
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.849
functionality and then resolve

633
00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:28.269
the issues if there

634
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:29.808
are issues. So if

635
00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:30.889
what was built is
