1478
00:30:59.383 --> 00:31:00.262
case, and then we

1479
00:31:00.262 --> 00:31:01.721
can improve our composable

1480
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:03.041
units. And so this

1481
00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:03.980
is the review step.

1482
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.200
We have, you know,

1483
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.319
kind of three distinct

1484
00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:07.659
agents that are running

1485
00:31:07.659 --> 00:31:08.318
here. It's a good

1486
00:31:08.318 --> 00:31:09.637
practice to encode the

1487
00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.157
agent names as constants

1488
00:31:11.157 --> 00:31:11.696
right at the top

1489
00:31:11.696 --> 00:31:12.517
of the file. So

1490
00:31:12.517 --> 00:31:13.396
it's super clear what

1491
00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:14.435
agents are running, what

1492
00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:15.974
agents are controlling that

1493
00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.055
given workflow. We can

1494
00:31:17.055 --> 00:31:18.433
always just search one

1495
00:31:18.433 --> 00:31:19.334
of these, you know,

1496
00:31:19.513 --> 00:31:20.393
output logs, and we

1497
00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:22.172
can see exactly where

1498
00:31:22.172 --> 00:31:23.031
our agent is at

1499
00:31:23.031 --> 00:31:24.171
in this workflow. So,

1500
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:24.990
you know, we are

1501
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.069
reviewing against the specification.

1502
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:28.040
Right. So super important

1503
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.240
point running the review,

1504
00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:31.097
uploading images next. And
