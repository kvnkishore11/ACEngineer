2218
00:45:29.358 --> 00:45:30.818
template meta prompt, but

2219
00:45:31.038 --> 00:45:32.398
it is also going

2220
00:45:32.398 --> 00:45:33.317
to do something special.

2221
00:45:33.317 --> 00:45:34.516
It's going to update

2222
00:45:34.516 --> 00:45:36.056
a prompt, okay? So

2223
00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:36.835
we're gonna update our

2224
00:45:36.835 --> 00:45:38.914
conditional documentation. What is

2225
00:45:38.914 --> 00:45:39.934
this exactly? What is

2226
00:45:39.934 --> 00:45:41.554
conditional documentation? Let's go

2227
00:45:41.554 --> 00:45:42.092
ahead and open this

2228
00:45:42.092 --> 00:45:42.833
up. Let's take a

2229
00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:43.413
look at this. So

2230
00:45:43.413 --> 00:45:44.311
we have a prompt

2231
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:45.552
here, right? A lower

2232
00:45:45.552 --> 00:45:46.771
level prompt that is

2233
00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:48.291
used in high level

2234
00:45:48.291 --> 00:45:49.530
prompts like the document

2235
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.141
prompt. And this is

2236
00:45:51.141 --> 00:45:53.081
going to conditionally add

2237
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:55.081
documentation to the high

2238
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:56.300
level prompt, right? To

2239
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.719
the agent calling the

2240
00:45:57.719 --> 00:45:58.880
high level prompt. So

2241
00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:00.199
this prompt helps you
