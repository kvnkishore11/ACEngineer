2648
00:54:29.297 --> 00:54:30.516
agentic layer, right? We

2649
00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:31.936
can fix the small

2650
00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:32.775
issue that we had

2651
00:54:32.896 --> 00:54:34.454
with the positioning, right?

2652
00:54:34.454 --> 00:54:35.393
We can encode that,

2653
00:54:35.393 --> 00:54:36.432
we can template that

2654
00:54:36.432 --> 00:54:37.793
into our engineering. All

2655
00:54:37.793 --> 00:54:38.351
the work we're doing

2656
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:39.590
here is going to

2657
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.590
improve your Agentic Coding

2658
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:43.108
KPIs. This is how

2659
00:54:43.108 --> 00:54:44.748
we know we're improving

2660
00:54:44.827 --> 00:54:46.367
our Agentic Coding capabilities.

2661
00:54:46.447 --> 00:54:47.186
This is what all

2662
00:54:47.186 --> 00:54:48.750
these steps in the

2663
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.347
software developer lifecycle helps

2664
00:54:50.347 --> 00:54:51.905
us achieve, right? That's

2665
00:54:51.905 --> 00:54:52.545
why we built the

2666
00:54:52.565 --> 00:54:53.782
agentic layer. We want

2667
00:54:53.782 --> 00:54:55.597
attempts down, size up,

2668
00:54:55.697 --> 00:54:57.476
streak up, presence down.

2669
00:54:57.856 --> 00:54:59.655
As a concrete example

2670
00:54:59.655 --> 00:55:00.974
of this, we ran
