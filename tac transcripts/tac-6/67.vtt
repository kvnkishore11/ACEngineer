1612
00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:30.622
sure download button for

1613
00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:32.221
query results. And that

1614
00:33:32.221 --> 00:33:32.721
should be it, right?

1615
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:33.461
So a simple patch,

1616
00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:33.840
I'm gonna write a

1617
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.101
comment here and now

1618
00:33:35.101 --> 00:33:35.901
I'm gonna run our

1619
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:38.160
patch workflow. Remember everything

1620
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.099
runs from the prompt

1621
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:40.539
source. So that's there,

1622
00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:41.599
I'm gonna open up

1623
00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:42.920
here and then let's

1624
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.398
go ahead and kick

1625
00:33:43.398 --> 00:33:44.358
off this new workflow.

1626
00:33:44.378 --> 00:33:44.818
This is gonna be

1627
00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:46.138
UV run and now

1628
00:33:46.138 --> 00:33:46.719
we're gonna run a

1629
00:33:46.719 --> 00:33:49.318
W patch, copy, place

1630
00:33:49.318 --> 00:33:50.577
that there. We need

1631
00:33:50.577 --> 00:33:51.778
the issue ID, it's

1632
00:33:51.778 --> 00:33:53.477
gonna be 15. And

1633
00:33:53.477 --> 00:33:54.712
we also want the

1634
00:33:54.712 --> 00:33:55.510
ADW ID, right? We're

1635
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.686
not starting new work,

1636
00:33:56.787 --> 00:33:58.002
we're building off existing

1637
00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:58.481
work. So I'm gonna

1638
00:33:58.481 --> 00:34:00.329
paste this in. That's
