2549
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:30.766
is why we have

2550
00:52:30.827 --> 00:52:32.126
one agent working on

2551
00:52:32.126 --> 00:52:33.507
a single problem with

2552
00:52:33.507 --> 00:52:34.686
a single purpose, right?

2553
00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:35.898
One agent, one prompt,

2554
00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:37.016
one purpose. What are

2555
00:52:37.016 --> 00:52:38.056
the benefits of this?

2556
00:52:38.077 --> 00:52:38.496
You free up the

2557
00:52:38.496 --> 00:52:39.777
context window. You can

2558
00:52:39.777 --> 00:52:40.596
let your agent focus

2559
00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:41.476
on a single problem.

2560
00:52:41.476 --> 00:52:43.775
Your prompts become improvable

2561
00:52:43.914 --> 00:52:45.014
as well as reusable,

2562
00:52:45.014 --> 00:52:46.634
invisible, of course. And

2563
00:52:46.634 --> 00:52:47.554
lastly, you create a

2564
00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:48.954
system where your code

2565
00:52:48.954 --> 00:52:50.273
base can be easily

2566
00:52:50.293 --> 00:52:51.853
evaluated, right, in a

2567
00:52:51.853 --> 00:52:52.972
deep technical sense and

2568
00:52:52.972 --> 00:52:54.592
just passively as you

2569
00:52:54.592 --> 00:52:55.570
work and build the

2570
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.431
agentic layer of your

2571
00:52:56.431 --> 00:52:57.710
codebase. So now

2572
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.250
we can agentically review

2573
00:52:59.329 --> 00:53:01.068
and document. This completes
