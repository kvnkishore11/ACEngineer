795
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:30.108
have the right state

796
00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:31.628
to run this workflow.

797
00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:32.528
And if we open

798
00:17:32.548 --> 00:17:33.709
up the file explorer

799
00:17:33.709 --> 00:17:34.868
here, collapse everything and

800
00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.228
open up agents, you

801
00:17:36.228 --> 00:17:37.228
can see we have

802
00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:38.867
this ADW ID with

803
00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:40.788
every dedicated agent, right?

804
00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:41.948
All their logs is

805
00:17:41.948 --> 00:17:42.727
getting placed here. And

806
00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:43.366
we have something really

807
00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:44.586
important. We have state

808
00:17:44.586 --> 00:17:46.406
meta information that travels

809
00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:47.487
along every one of

810
00:17:47.487 --> 00:17:49.106
our AI developer workflows.

811
00:17:49.226 --> 00:17:50.405
It's really simple. As

812
00:17:50.405 --> 00:17:51.066
you can see here,

813
00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:52.766
ADW ID key fields,

814
00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:54.195
branch name, plan file,

815
00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:55.932
issue class. Okay, our

816
00:17:55.932 --> 00:17:57.550
workflows validate that the

817
00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.929
state that they need

818
00:17:58.989 --> 00:18:00.487
exists from the state
