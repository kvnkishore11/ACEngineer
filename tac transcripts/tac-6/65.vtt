1556
00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:30.248
can, let's go ahead

1557
00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:31.446
and open up the

1558
00:32:31.446 --> 00:32:32.105
code as well. So

1559
00:32:32.105 --> 00:32:33.178
I'm going to Huffactor

1560
00:32:33.178 --> 00:32:33.717
agent here, I'm gonna

1561
00:32:33.717 --> 00:32:35.057
type slash start and

1562
00:32:35.057 --> 00:32:35.757
it's going to run

1563
00:32:35.757 --> 00:32:37.195
a start command to

1564
00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:38.934
agentically kick off the

1565
00:32:38.934 --> 00:32:40.055
client servers. It's gonna

1566
00:32:40.055 --> 00:32:40.673
kick it off again,

1567
00:32:40.673 --> 00:32:41.413
there we go. And

1568
00:32:41.413 --> 00:32:41.854
so you can see

1569
00:32:41.854 --> 00:32:43.212
we have our download

1570
00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:43.893
here. So if we

1571
00:32:43.893 --> 00:32:45.392
click this, very cool.

1572
00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:45.832
So if we click

1573
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:46.790
this and if we

1574
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.090
click download product, we

1575
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.849
should see the same

1576
00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:49.789
thing, great. We have

1577
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:51.189
a download there, select

1578
00:32:51.189 --> 00:32:52.588
five users, just running

1579
00:32:52.608 --> 00:32:53.807
a random query here.

1580
00:32:53.887 --> 00:32:55.107
And this is where

1581
00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:56.086
our issue is, okay?

1582
00:32:56.086 --> 00:32:56.846
So yeah, so this

1583
00:32:56.846 --> 00:32:57.806
is right, the wrong

1584
00:32:57.806 --> 00:32:58.746
formatting. This should be

1585
00:32:58.746 --> 00:32:59.724
right next to the

1586
00:32:59.724 --> 00:33:00.805
hide button. If we
