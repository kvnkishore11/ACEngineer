1270
00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:00.059
we are still implementing

1271
00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:01.118
the solution. Having a

1272
00:27:01.118 --> 00:27:02.377
review system is really

1273
00:27:02.377 --> 00:27:03.617
important. As we discussed

1274
00:27:03.617 --> 00:27:04.656
in lesson five, you

1275
00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:05.936
want to be operating

1276
00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:06.976
out the loop over

1277
00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:07.976
the long term. As

1278
00:27:07.976 --> 00:27:08.815
you improve here as

1279
00:27:08.815 --> 00:27:09.815
an agentic engineer, it

1280
00:27:09.815 --> 00:27:10.834
will become better and

1281
00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:11.894
better and better at

1282
00:27:11.894 --> 00:27:12.993
operating the codebase

1283
00:27:12.993 --> 00:27:14.432
without you because you've

1284
00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:15.192
put in the work

1285
00:27:15.251 --> 00:27:17.011
into the agentic layer

1286
00:27:17.051 --> 00:27:18.852
covering the software developer

1287
00:27:18.852 --> 00:27:19.632
lifecycle. So you can

1288
00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:20.451
see here, it took

1289
00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:21.871
about eight minutes for

1290
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:23.750
our agents to implement

1291
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.830
the solution. We should

1292
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.270
have a commit and

1293
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.510
a PR following here

1294
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.931
pretty soon. This will

1295
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:30.411
update the existing PR,
