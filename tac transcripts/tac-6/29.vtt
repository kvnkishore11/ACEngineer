635
00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:30.889
what was built is

636
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:31.687
not what we asked

637
00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:33.008
for, resolve the issues

638
00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:33.467
and make up the

639
00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:35.168
difference, post the results

640
00:14:35.368 --> 00:14:36.527
and push and update

641
00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:37.767
the PR. OK, so

642
00:14:37.807 --> 00:14:38.447
that's what this review

643
00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:39.586
does. So without even

644
00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:40.407
looking at the code,

645
00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:41.725
right, without even looking

646
00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:42.306
at the steps, we

647
00:14:42.306 --> 00:14:43.225
know exactly what this

648
00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:44.418
does. Let's see if

649
00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:44.797
our codebase is

650
00:14:44.797 --> 00:14:46.135
set up. Fantastic. It

651
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.096
is. You can always

652
00:14:47.096 --> 00:14:48.794
review the required steps.

653
00:14:48.815 --> 00:14:49.234
So you can see

654
00:14:49.234 --> 00:14:49.833
we have some manual

655
00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:50.673
steps here. I'm going

656
00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:51.332
to work through these

657
00:14:51.332 --> 00:14:52.312
quickly, get this all

658
00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:53.610
filled out, set the

659
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.509
origin back to the

660
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:55.509
TAC six codebase.

661
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:56.369
You're going to want

662
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:57.328
to, of course, fork,

663
00:14:57.528 --> 00:14:57.947
set it to a

664
00:14:57.947 --> 00:14:58.607
new codebase. So

665
00:14:58.607 --> 00:14:59.326
you have access to

666
00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:01.046
GitHub issues and get
