00:20:29.577 --> 00:20:31.498
agents behavior. And in

950
00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:32.696
the review prompt, we're

951
00:20:32.696 --> 00:20:34.496
doing a couple essential

952
00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:35.276
things. If we just

953
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.394
collapse everything, we can

954
00:20:36.394 --> 00:20:37.194
see a simple view

955
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:37.953
of this prompt and

956
00:20:37.953 --> 00:20:38.534
understand it at a

957
00:20:38.534 --> 00:20:39.493
high level. There's always

958
00:20:39.493 --> 00:20:40.113
a great place to

959
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.232
start when you're reviewing

960
00:20:41.232 --> 00:20:42.511
prompts, collapse, keep it

961
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:43.810
simple. Don't get overwhelmed.

962
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.911
Follow the instructions, review

963
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:45.910
the work done against

964
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.349
a specification file, right?

965
00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:49.048
Use git diff, understand

966
00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:49.548
the changes that were

967
00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:51.428
made, capture screenshots and

968
00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:53.267
report any issues. Okay.

969
00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:54.685
If not report success.

970
00:20:54.913 --> 00:20:55.634
Great. What are we

971
00:20:55.634 --> 00:20:56.972
reporting exactly? You can

972
00:20:56.972 --> 00:20:58.292
see our variables here,

973
00:20:58.413 --> 00:20:59.833
ADW spec file, agent

974
00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.152
name, review image directory.
