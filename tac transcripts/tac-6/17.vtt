349
00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:30.007
an engineer. A focused

350
00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:30.867
engineer working on a

351
00:08:30.867 --> 00:08:32.047
single task is a

352
00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:33.784
productive engineer. Agents are

353
00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.085
the same. Big context

354
00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:37.082
windows cause context confusion.

355
00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:38.442
This drops your agent's

356
00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:39.461
performance. And when your

357
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.620
agent's performance drops, your

358
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.558
performance drops. So let

359
00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:45.657
your agent's Focus. Every

360
00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:46.596
piece of context you

361
00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:48.135
add increases the number

362
00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:49.554
of variables your agent

363
00:08:49.554 --> 00:08:50.835
has to reason about.

364
00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.053
You want to context

365
00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:53.313
engineer as little as

366
00:08:53.313 --> 00:08:54.393
possible. You want the

367
00:08:54.393 --> 00:08:55.871
minimum context in your

368
00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:57.211
prompt required to solve

369
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.071
the problem. When you

370
00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:59.509
adopt your agent's perspective,

371
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.450
it should be clear
