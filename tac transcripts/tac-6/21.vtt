441
00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.207
can rerun these over

442
00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:31.908
and over. You can

443
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.486
get checkout before you

444
00:10:33.486 --> 00:10:34.765
ran work and run

445
00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:35.745
it. right, you can

446
00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:37.725
literally create evals for

447
00:10:37.725 --> 00:10:38.903
your codebase, which

448
00:10:38.903 --> 00:10:40.283
means you accelerate on

449
00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:41.503
the path to improving

450
00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:43.101
your agentic KPIs that

451
00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.841
much further. And all

452
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:45.880
that aside, you will

453
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.519
passively, you will start

454
00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.139
forming evals in your

455
00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:50.899
head just passively as

456
00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:51.458
you build up the

457
00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:52.778
agentic layer of your

458
00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:53.837
codebase. You'll understand

459
00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:54.956
what works well and

460
00:10:54.956 --> 00:10:56.515
what doesn't work. So

461
00:10:56.515 --> 00:10:57.015
as we work through

462
00:10:57.015 --> 00:10:58.216
the review and document

463
00:10:58.216 --> 00:10:59.034
steps in this code

464
00:10:59.034 --> 00:10:59.975
base and the tactics

465
00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:01.134
codebase, notice how
