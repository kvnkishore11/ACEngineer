1197
00:25:29.482 --> 00:25:30.801
changing one thing. We

1198
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:32.121
want a simple quick

1199
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:33.060
fix. This is how

1200
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.859
we do it. Just

1201
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.700
to mention it here,

1202
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.798
ADW patch does exactly

1203
00:25:36.798 --> 00:25:38.317
this, okay? It runs

1204
00:25:38.396 --> 00:25:39.395
this workflow, right? So

1205
00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:40.835
create and implement patch.

1206
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:41.673
And so the first

1207
00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:42.034
thing we do is

1208
00:25:42.034 --> 00:25:43.133
create a patch plan,

1209
00:25:43.133 --> 00:25:44.571
and then we run

1210
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:46.230
our implement plan. And

1211
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.930
we all know what

1212
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.388
implement does. It runs

1213
00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:50.607
the slash implement agentic

1214
00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:51.586
prompt. We can open

1215
00:25:51.586 --> 00:25:52.247
that up, of course,

1216
00:25:52.247 --> 00:25:53.904
as well. And you'll

1217
00:25:53.904 --> 00:25:54.765
see we are starting

1218
00:25:54.765 --> 00:25:56.482
to reuse our prompts.

1219
00:25:56.482 --> 00:25:57.761
This is a higher

1220
00:25:57.801 --> 00:25:59.000
order prompt. It takes

1221
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.220
in a plan, right?
