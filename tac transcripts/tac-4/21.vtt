00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:30.504
request back for us

431
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:31.585
to review. Instead of

432
00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:32.565
diving right into the

433
00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.864
TAC4 codebase, let's

434
00:10:33.864 --> 00:10:34.524
just look at how

435
00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:36.124
this simple Outloop system

436
00:10:36.124 --> 00:10:37.442
works end to end.

437
00:10:37.523 --> 00:10:38.322
Let's of course start

438
00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:39.663
with our prompt source,

439
00:10:39.743 --> 00:10:41.422
GitHub issues. For the

440
00:10:41.422 --> 00:10:42.601
TAC4 codebase, I'm

441
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.022
gonna go ahead and

442
00:10:43.022 --> 00:10:44.400
just create a lightweight

443
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.380
issue for us to

444
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.159
understand this process. I'll

445
00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:49.799
say ADW documentation. I'm

446
00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:50.839
gonna type slash chore

447
00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:53.399
to document the ADW

448
00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:56.490
directory, read everything. in

449
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.927
ADW then update read

450
00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:01.846
me with information how
