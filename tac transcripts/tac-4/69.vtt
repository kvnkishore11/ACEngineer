1645
00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:30.835
units as you progress

1646
00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:31.635
through each lesson. But

1647
00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:33.235
this is important. ADWs

1648
00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:34.434
let us create a

1649
00:34:34.434 --> 00:34:36.393
new agentic layer around

1650
00:34:36.393 --> 00:34:37.711
our codebase that

1651
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:39.012
tell our agents how

1652
00:34:39.012 --> 00:34:40.451
to operate and perform

1653
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.568
real engineering work. Okay.

1654
00:34:42.648 --> 00:34:43.409
If we look here,

1655
00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.768
this workflow is complete.

1656
00:34:44.768 --> 00:34:46.206
There's the PR. We

1657
00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:47.226
can get out of

1658
00:34:47.226 --> 00:34:48.106
this. Look at this

1659
00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:48.766
issue here. You can

1660
00:34:48.766 --> 00:34:50.304
see this entire workflow

1661
00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:51.483
took about 17 or

1662
00:34:51.483 --> 00:34:52.702
so minutes. And there

1663
00:34:52.702 --> 00:34:53.463
it is, right? So

1664
00:34:53.503 --> 00:34:54.422
we now have JSON-L

1665
00:34:54.422 --> 00:34:56.090
support. We can hop

1666
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.329
in here, review this.

1667
00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:58.288
There's all the files

1668
00:34:58.288 --> 00:34:59.447
changed. It's all getting

1669
00:34:59.447 --> 00:35:00.646
reported based on our
