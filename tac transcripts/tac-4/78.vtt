1873
00:38:59.148 --> 00:39:00.007
next level. And what

1874
00:39:00.007 --> 00:39:00.786
is the next level?

1875
00:39:01.007 --> 00:39:02.025
The next level is

1876
00:39:02.146 --> 00:39:04.625
make this run reliably,

1877
00:39:04.664 --> 00:39:06.463
right? Improve this, make

1878
00:39:06.463 --> 00:39:07.902
our agents better, make

1879
00:39:07.902 --> 00:39:09.282
them more consistent. How

1880
00:39:09.282 --> 00:39:09.842
do we do that?

1881
00:39:09.963 --> 00:39:10.362
We do this of

1882
00:39:10.362 --> 00:39:11.501
course by closing the

1883
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:12.222
loop. More on that

1884
00:39:12.222 --> 00:39:12.800
in a second. A

1885
00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:13.481
couple of things I

1886
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:14.001
want to touch on

1887
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:14.960
here. We set up

1888
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.300
a GitHub web hook

1889
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.199
here, and then I

1890
00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:19.557
exposed this functionality via

1891
00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.989
a A proxy server,

1892
00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:22.588
I'm using Cloud Flared.

1893
00:39:22.726 --> 00:39:23.887
You can use anything

1894
00:39:23.887 --> 00:39:24.846
you want, set up

1895
00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:26.664
your own dev infrastructure.

1896
00:39:26.724 --> 00:39:27.463
The key is just

1897
00:39:27.483 --> 00:39:28.302
to set up a

1898
00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:30.041
dedicated environment. I highly,
