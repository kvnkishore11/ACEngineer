848
00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:01.136
So we're doing that

849
00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:01.696
here and you can

850
00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:03.016
see our agent working

851
00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.734
through all this. And

852
00:19:04.734 --> 00:19:06.553
then we are copying

853
00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:07.632
our environment variables. We

854
00:19:07.632 --> 00:19:08.471
have a new top

855
00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:10.269
level environment variable file

856
00:19:10.269 --> 00:19:10.789
we need to set

857
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:11.888
up. We're going to

858
00:19:11.888 --> 00:19:13.167
do that same installation

859
00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:13.807
of front end and

860
00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.186
back end dependencies as

861
00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:16.853
before. And then we're

862
00:19:16.853 --> 00:19:18.571
gonna copy our previous

863
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:21.348
codebase.env file for our

864
00:19:21.348 --> 00:19:22.667
server. You can see

865
00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:23.527
the environment variable just

866
00:19:23.527 --> 00:19:25.085
got created there. Our

867
00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:25.825
.env is set up.

868
00:19:25.884 --> 00:19:26.963
So a cool thing

869
00:19:26.963 --> 00:19:27.502
you can add into

870
00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:28.501
your prompts is a

871
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.039
report feature. It's gonna
