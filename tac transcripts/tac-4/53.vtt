1242
00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:31.241
target specific classes of

1243
00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:33.640
problems with this switch,

1244
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.118
right? With this feature

1245
00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:36.377
inside of our ADW

1246
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:37.689
that classifies is this

1247
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:38.949
a chore bug feature

1248
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:40.988
or any other specific

1249
00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:42.106
class of problems that

1250
00:26:42.106 --> 00:26:43.145
you solve in your

1251
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:44.226
codebase. All right.

1252
00:26:44.246 --> 00:26:44.845
This is a very

1253
00:26:44.845 --> 00:26:46.184
important pattern of agent

1254
00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:46.683
to code and you

1255
00:26:46.683 --> 00:26:47.044
need to be able

1256
00:26:47.044 --> 00:26:49.163
to target specific classes

1257
00:26:49.163 --> 00:26:50.342
of problems. So while

1258
00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:51.221
our agents building this

1259
00:26:51.221 --> 00:26:52.201
out on our device,

1260
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:52.941
let's go ahead and

1261
00:26:52.941 --> 00:26:54.480
break down how exactly

1262
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.559
this works inside of

1263
00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:56.558
the codebase, right?

1264
00:26:56.798 --> 00:26:57.478
How is your agent

1265
00:26:57.478 --> 00:26:58.278
doing this work for

1266
00:26:58.278 --> 00:26:59.576
us agentically? It all

1267
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:00.916
starts in the ADW
