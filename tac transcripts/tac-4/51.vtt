1189
00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:30.334
exact same workflow now,

1190
00:25:30.334 --> 00:25:31.512
right? The only difference

1191
00:25:31.512 --> 00:25:32.133
is I kick this

1192
00:25:32.133 --> 00:25:33.051
off with a manual

1193
00:25:33.051 --> 00:25:34.132
trigger. It has its

1194
00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:35.830
own unique ADW ID

1195
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.430
to identify this AI

1196
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.130
developer workflow. And now

1197
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.709
it's got its own

1198
00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:41.489
branch, JSON-L support. Now

1199
00:25:41.489 --> 00:25:42.009
it's gonna do this

1200
00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:43.008
work for us agentically.

1201
00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:43.647
You can see the

1202
00:25:43.647 --> 00:25:45.606
branch that we're operating

1203
00:25:45.606 --> 00:25:46.366
on in this code

1204
00:25:46.366 --> 00:25:47.965
base just got updated.

1205
00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:49.164
Our agent has taken

1206
00:25:49.164 --> 00:25:49.944
the wheel. We are

1207
00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:50.724
now out of the

1208
00:25:50.724 --> 00:25:51.903
loop, right? We said

1209
00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:52.644
what we want done

1210
00:25:52.644 --> 00:25:53.722
and now it's starting

1211
00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:54.482
to do the work

1212
00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:55.642
for us. We're focusing

1213
00:25:55.642 --> 00:25:56.461
on the what, not

1214
00:25:56.461 --> 00:25:57.840
the how. The details

1215
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.381
of how things are

1216
00:25:58.381 --> 00:26:00.200
done, we've already encoded
