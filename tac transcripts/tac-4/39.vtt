00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.039
report feature. It's gonna

872
00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.098
set up some things,

873
00:19:31.098 --> 00:19:31.638
right? It's gonna run

874
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:32.617
all these previous commands.

875
00:19:32.617 --> 00:19:33.217
And then our agent

876
00:19:33.217 --> 00:19:34.256
is going to report

877
00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:35.454
some results to us,

878
00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:36.857
to the engineer. to

879
00:19:36.857 --> 00:19:38.736
your coworkers executing this

880
00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:39.535
script, right? So it's

881
00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:40.294
gonna have some useful

882
00:19:40.294 --> 00:19:41.673
information, you know, work

883
00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:43.112
completed and then action

884
00:19:43.112 --> 00:19:44.349
required. Okay, so it's

885
00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.150
telling me, you know,

886
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.729
I need to fill

887
00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:46.307
out the root level

888
00:19:46.307 --> 00:19:47.807
M and app level

889
00:19:47.807 --> 00:19:48.786
was already copied from

890
00:19:48.786 --> 00:19:50.463
tack two and the

891
00:19:50.463 --> 00:19:51.243
API keys are all

892
00:19:51.243 --> 00:19:52.163
good there. So we

893
00:19:52.163 --> 00:19:52.701
don't need to make

894
00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:53.701
any changes there. But

895
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:54.380
then to set up

896
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.398
our AFK agent, we

897
00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:56.798
have this detail here

898
00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:57.397
we need to set

899
00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.557
up a remote repo

900
00:19:58.557 --> 00:19:59.557
so that we can

901
00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:00.436
of course, you know,
