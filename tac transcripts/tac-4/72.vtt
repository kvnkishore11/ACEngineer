1722
00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:00.704
actually turned out because

1723
00:36:00.704 --> 00:36:01.724
our agent was updating

1724
00:36:01.724 --> 00:36:02.824
in this environment. You

1725
00:36:02.824 --> 00:36:03.425
can see we're still

1726
00:36:03.425 --> 00:36:04.483
on that feature. So

1727
00:36:04.483 --> 00:36:05.103
what I'll do here

1728
00:36:05.103 --> 00:36:06.123
is just boot up

1729
00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.443
the client and server

1730
00:36:07.503 --> 00:36:08.563
again with all this

1731
00:36:08.563 --> 00:36:10.222
updated code here. And

1732
00:36:10.222 --> 00:36:10.742
then let's just see

1733
00:36:10.742 --> 00:36:11.362
what it looks like,

1734
00:36:11.362 --> 00:36:12.181
right? Let's open up

1735
00:36:12.342 --> 00:36:12.922
Chrome. Let's go to

1736
00:36:12.922 --> 00:36:14.021
our natural language interface

1737
00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:15.181
and refresh. You can

1738
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:15.940
see it's added a

1739
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.900
couple different test items.

1740
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.480
It was operating right

1741
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.760
on this SQL database.

1742
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.798
So that looks good.

1743
00:36:21.798 --> 00:36:22.539
There are things there.

1744
00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:23.018
Let's do a quick

1745
00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:24.898
regression test, select users,

1746
00:36:25.197 --> 00:36:27.378
descending, sign update, Let's

1747
00:36:27.378 --> 00:36:28.177
fire that off. We

1748
00:36:28.177 --> 00:36:29.295
should get our same

1749
00:36:29.295 --> 00:36:30.735
prompt. There we go.
