1695
00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:30.829
will do. This is

1696
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:32.148
really, really important. This

1697
00:35:32.148 --> 00:35:33.547
lets you improve, right?

1698
00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:34.206
It's not enough to

1699
00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:35.166
just run a random

1700
00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.364
ad hoc prompt because

1701
00:35:36.364 --> 00:35:37.284
how will you know

1702
00:35:37.284 --> 00:35:38.103
how to improve that?

1703
00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:38.983
And more importantly, how

1704
00:35:38.983 --> 00:35:40.101
will your agents know?

1705
00:35:40.322 --> 00:35:41.101
how to improve that.

1706
00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:41.521
You know, we can

1707
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:42.260
look through this entire

1708
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:42.960
plan. You can see

1709
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.199
it's very comprehensive. Our

1710
00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:45.559
agent created a 170

1711
00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:46.518
line plan and then

1712
00:35:46.518 --> 00:35:47.798
our implementer went and

1713
00:35:47.798 --> 00:35:48.838
built this out. Okay.

1714
00:35:48.838 --> 00:35:49.617
So we have an

1715
00:35:49.617 --> 00:35:52.217
opinionated plan build workflow

1716
00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:53.396
that fits our code

1717
00:35:53.396 --> 00:35:55.014
base for building features.

1718
00:35:55.014 --> 00:35:55.954
Okay. So, you know,

1719
00:35:55.954 --> 00:35:56.773
we can hop into

1720
00:35:56.773 --> 00:35:57.634
this codebase here.

1721
00:35:58.166 --> 00:35:59.565
and see how this

1722
00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:00.704
actually turned out because
