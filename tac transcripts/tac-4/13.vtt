product grows and becomes

259
00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:36.055
unique and differentiated. In

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.175
this lesson, we chain

the ADW, AI. developer

267
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.420
a reusable agentic workflow

268
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.218
that combines code, agentic

269
00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:55.958
prompts, and agents to
