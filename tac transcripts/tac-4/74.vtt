00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.601
and finder assets. Here

1775
00:37:02.601 --> 00:37:04.039
we go. Browser drag

1776
00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:05.679
and drop simple JSON

1777
00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:08.079
data here. Scroll down.

1778
00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:08.998
Let's see where our

1779
00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:10.719
simple data is. Okay.

1780
00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:11.378
So that's here. I

1781
00:37:11.378 --> 00:37:12.159
think that was there

1782
00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:12.739
before. So I'm just

1783
00:37:12.739 --> 00:37:13.139
going to go ahead

1784
00:37:13.139 --> 00:37:14.257
and just delete this

1785
00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:15.458
and I'll delete complex

1786
00:37:15.458 --> 00:37:16.905
data as well. And

1787
00:37:16.905 --> 00:37:18.266
then I'll redirect and

1788
00:37:18.286 --> 00:37:19.085
drop this in, right?

1789
00:37:19.144 --> 00:37:19.565
We wanna make sure

1790
00:37:19.565 --> 00:37:20.465
this is a fresh

1791
00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:21.505
upload. Let me go

1792
00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:22.184
ahead and hide this

1793
00:37:22.204 --> 00:37:22.543
so we can see

1794
00:37:22.543 --> 00:37:24.224
everything below. Upload, sample

1795
00:37:24.224 --> 00:37:25.483
data, JSONL, drag and

1796
00:37:25.503 --> 00:37:26.362
drop. There it is,

1797
00:37:26.362 --> 00:37:27.603
sample data from a

1798
00:37:27.603 --> 00:37:28.483
JSONL file. And you

1799
00:37:28.483 --> 00:37:29.043
can see we have

1800
00:37:29.043 --> 00:37:30.143
that exact same naming
