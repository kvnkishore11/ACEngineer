1163
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.040
be anything you want

1164
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.659
using astral UV to

1165
00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:02.858
run Python single file

1166
00:25:02.858 --> 00:25:03.882
scripts. You can see

1167
00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:04.301
you have a couple

1168
00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:05.601
of dependencies there. These

1169
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:06.460
can be bund scripts

1170
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.159
if you want, shell

1171
00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:08.259
scripts, whatever you want.

1172
00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.038
The whole point is

1173
00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:10.277
that they're a layer

1174
00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:11.375
on top of your

1175
00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:12.375
codebase. So let's

1176
00:25:12.394 --> 00:25:13.055
go ahead, copy this

1177
00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:15.333
command, paste. Let's get

1178
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:16.093
rid of the ADW

1179
00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:17.392
ID. We don't need

1180
00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:19.670
that. And let's just

1181
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.196
run 33. We need

1182
00:25:21.196 --> 00:25:21.856
to make sure we're

1183
00:25:21.856 --> 00:25:22.896
going into the ADW's

1184
00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.536
directory here, ADW slash,

1185
00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:25.914
kick it off. And

1186
00:25:25.914 --> 00:25:26.994
here we go. So

1187
00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:27.934
just like in our

1188
00:25:27.934 --> 00:25:29.173
environment, it's running that

1189
00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:30.334
exact same workflow now,
