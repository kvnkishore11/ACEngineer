WEBVTT

352
00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:00.756
we'll run two ADWs

353
00:09:00.777 --> 00:09:02.076
to automate the plan

354
00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:03.416
and build steps of

355
00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:05.075
the software development lifecycle.

356
00:09:05.075 --> 00:09:05.875
We'll go from prompt

357
00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:07.494
input to review. So

358
00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:08.114
this is our first

359
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.352
ADW. We wanna keep

360
00:09:09.352 --> 00:09:10.072
it simple, but I

361
00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:10.913
also wanna show you

362
00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:11.932
the power of having

363
00:09:11.932 --> 00:09:13.490
your own dedicated environment.

364
00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:14.490
So here's what we're

365
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.970
gonna use for these

366
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.889
four elements. For a

367
00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.328
prompt input, we'll use

368
00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:19.708
GitHub issues here. We'll

369
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.268
create new issues. and

370
00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:22.547
the title and description

371
00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:23.947
will be the prompt

372
00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:24.765
that our agent will

373
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:25.885
execute on. For our

374
00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:27.044
trigger, we're going to

375
00:09:27.044 --> 00:09:29.024
use GitHub webhooks. I

376
00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:30.344
have this configured here.
