1267
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:00.916
starts in the ADW

1268
00:27:01.276 --> 00:27:02.855
plan build. Here's the

1269
00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:04.434
workflow, right? It's right

1270
00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:05.433
here at the top

1271
00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:05.854
of the file. Very

1272
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.471
easy to understand. Fetch

1273
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:09.269
the GitHub issue details,

1274
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.150
right? So pull in

1275
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.127
the prompt source, creating

1276
00:27:12.127 --> 00:27:13.506
a feature branch for

1277
00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:14.405
this work. This could

1278
00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:15.184
be a chore or

1279
00:27:15.184 --> 00:27:16.003
a bug as well.

1280
00:27:16.643 --> 00:27:17.303
We're then running our

1281
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:18.721
plan agent. There's gonna

1282
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:19.580
be a clog code

1283
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.138
with a specific plan

1284
00:27:21.138 --> 00:27:22.178
prompt. It's gonna run

1285
00:27:22.178 --> 00:27:24.096
our slash feature reusable

1286
00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:24.974
prompt. Then we're gonna

1287
00:27:24.974 --> 00:27:26.334
have our build agent

1288
00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:27.664
take the plan and

1289
00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:28.365
based on the plan,

1290
00:27:28.365 --> 00:27:29.204
it'll pull in all

1291
00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:30.804
the right context. Again,
