153
00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.414
agentic coding KPIs. We

154
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.534
want presence down, size

155
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.213
up, streak up, and

156
00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:05.992
attempts down. What's the

157
00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:07.092
best way to accomplish

158
00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.271
great agentic coding KPIs?

159
00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.890
You guessed it, stay

160
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.251
out the loop and

161
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.569
focus on building the

162
00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.688
system that builds the

163
00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.889
system. We're going to

164
00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.267
accomplish this by adding

165
00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:19.867
a net new agentic

166
00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:21.127
layer to your code

167
00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.586
bases. This is gonna

168
00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:23.706
be different It's gonna

169
00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:24.685
be a little challenging

170
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:25.704
and it's going to

171
00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:27.343
be incredible if you

172
00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:28.903
take action on this.
