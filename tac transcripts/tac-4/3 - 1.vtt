00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.921
of the software developer

50
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.140
lifecycle to augment and

51
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.760
automate your codebases.

52
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.019
Every tactic you'll learn

53
00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:37.180
was created to be

54
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.899
simple, compressed mental frameworks

55
00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:41.239
you can use every

56
00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.198
single day for your

57
00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:43.879
engineering work. First, you

58
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.399
stop coding. Our hands

59
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.457
and mind are no

60
00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:47.418
longer the best tool

61
00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:48.477
for the job of

62
00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:50.474
writing code. Then you

63
00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:52.433
adopt your agent's perspective

64
00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:53.653
so you can maximize

65
00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:54.593
the leverage you get

66
00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:56.733
from your agents then

67
00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:58.492
you template your engineering

68
00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.311
so you can deliver

69
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.451
consistent results in complex
