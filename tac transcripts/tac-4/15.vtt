289
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.899
default. We're creating a

290
00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:32.338
concrete term for this

291
00:07:32.377 --> 00:07:33.697
pulling it from principle

292
00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:34.916
to decoding to be

293
00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.514
absolutely clear about how

294
00:07:36.514 --> 00:07:39.165
powerful and differentiated this

295
00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:40.744
unit of engineering is.

296
00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.422
AI developer workflows are

297
00:07:42.422 --> 00:07:43.101
what we'll use to

298
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.459
automate not just the

299
00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:46.399
software developer lifecycle, but

300
00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.555
all engineering work and

301
00:07:48.615 --> 00:07:50.495
all workflows you want

302
00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.052
your agent to operate

303
00:07:52.112 --> 00:07:53.031
on your behalf. If

304
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.071
you understand this lesson

305
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:55.290
and start putting these

306
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.269
ideas to work in

307
00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:57.427
your codebase, you'll

308
00:07:57.427 --> 00:07:59.326
fast track your transition

309
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.608
into the future of
