00:43:29.144 --> 00:43:30.204
They're not running your

2090
00:43:30.204 --> 00:43:31.503
prompts. They're not built

2091
00:43:31.523 --> 00:43:33.123
to solve your problems,

2092
00:43:33.182 --> 00:43:34.663
right? Your classes of

2093
00:43:34.663 --> 00:43:35.802
problems that every engineer

2094
00:43:35.802 --> 00:43:37.260
faces. So invest in

2095
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.081
this. This is a

2096
00:43:38.081 --> 00:43:39.920
critical, critical lesson, right?

2097
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.498
Start with great defaults.

2098
00:43:41.559 --> 00:43:41.978
You know, for your

2099
00:43:41.978 --> 00:43:43.079
prompt input, I highly

2100
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:43.878
recommend you just go

2101
00:43:43.878 --> 00:43:45.197
with GitHub issues for

2102
00:43:45.197 --> 00:43:46.197
your review system at

2103
00:43:46.197 --> 00:43:47.757
the end, GitHub PRs,

2104
00:43:47.795 --> 00:43:49.056
and then your trigger

2105
00:43:49.056 --> 00:43:50.215
and your environment. Just

2106
00:43:50.215 --> 00:43:51.155
start setting this up

2107
00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:53.114
locally and then offload

2108
00:43:53.114 --> 00:43:54.452
it to another device,

2109
00:43:54.552 --> 00:43:55.072
right? You want to

2110
00:43:55.072 --> 00:43:55.813
get to this point

2111
00:43:55.813 --> 00:43:56.972
where you start with

2112
00:43:56.972 --> 00:43:57.911
low hanging fruit, you

2113
00:43:57.911 --> 00:43:59.070
know, build up trust

2114
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.030
and your ADW and
