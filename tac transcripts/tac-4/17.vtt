331
00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:30.478
Outloop system. This is

332
00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:30.959
what we're going to

333
00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.259
focus on here in

334
00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:33.538
lesson four. The four

335
00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:35.398
elements are prompt input,

336
00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:36.817
the trigger, you'll need

337
00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.135
an environment, and then

338
00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:39.395
a review system. These

339
00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:40.475
four elements can be

340
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:42.394
remembered with Peter. These

341
00:08:42.394 --> 00:08:43.413
make up the four

342
00:08:43.453 --> 00:08:45.493
elements of AFK agents.

343
00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:47.371
Peter, prompt input, trigger,

344
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:49.030
environment, review. With this

345
00:08:49.051 --> 00:08:50.350
setup, your agents can

346
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.260
run while you're AFK.

347
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:53.900
AFK agents are the

348
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.600
agents you'll build to

349
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.739
run the loop while

350
00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:57.979
you stay out of

351
00:08:57.999 --> 00:08:58.817
it. In this lesson,

352
00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:00.756
we'll run two ADWs
