1040
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.161
to mid-level prompt where

1041
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:32.779
we detail what we

1042
00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:34.660
want done. Adding support

1043
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.439
for uploading JSON-L files.

1044
00:22:36.499 --> 00:22:36.878
And then we have

1045
00:22:36.878 --> 00:22:38.179
a couple additional details

1046
00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:39.958
here. Standard, lib only,

1047
00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.438
no new libraries, concat

1048
00:22:41.438 --> 00:22:44.576
nested fields, handle arrays,

1049
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.057
update the UI. Okay.

1050
00:22:46.237 --> 00:22:47.316
Brand new feature coming

1051
00:22:47.316 --> 00:22:48.096
in, right? Net new.

1052
00:22:48.316 --> 00:22:49.875
And we have disabled

1053
00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:51.914
our agent running in

1054
00:22:51.914 --> 00:22:53.055
its own sandbox here.

1055
00:22:53.055 --> 00:22:54.473
The webhook event is

1056
00:22:54.493 --> 00:22:55.534
off. It's not listening.

1057
00:22:55.753 --> 00:22:56.594
So this won't run.

1058
00:22:57.093 --> 00:22:57.492
We're going to kick

1059
00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:58.192
this off on our

1060
00:22:58.192 --> 00:22:59.413
device with a local

1061
00:22:59.413 --> 00:23:00.711
trigger. All right. So
