1519
00:31:59.031 --> 00:32:00.271
to build the prompt,

1520
00:32:00.332 --> 00:32:01.490
log the prompt, and

1521
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.211
then run the code

1522
00:32:02.391 --> 00:32:03.730
using Claude Code in

1523
00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.750
programmable mode. All right.

1524
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.608
This is why this

1525
00:32:06.608 --> 00:32:07.709
is so important, right?

1526
00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:08.647
We're kicking off cloud

1527
00:32:08.647 --> 00:32:09.827
code right here like

1528
00:32:09.907 --> 00:32:10.846
this. Be sure to

1529
00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:11.527
read through this. It

1530
00:32:11.527 --> 00:32:12.625
is running dangerously, but

1531
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:13.586
because it's in its

1532
00:32:13.586 --> 00:32:14.345
own environment, this is

1533
00:32:14.345 --> 00:32:15.285
going to be safe,

1534
00:32:15.285 --> 00:32:16.064
right? And the key

1535
00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:17.124
idea here is this

1536
00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:17.942
is, this is the

1537
00:32:17.942 --> 00:32:19.801
value of programmable mode.

1538
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:20.402
This is why it's

1539
00:32:20.422 --> 00:32:21.421
so powerful. It lets

1540
00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:22.701
us use Claude Code

1541
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.220
as a new agentic

1542
00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:25.739
coding primitive, where we

1543
00:32:25.739 --> 00:32:26.858
can call our agent

1544
00:32:26.858 --> 00:32:28.238
with any prompt and

1545
00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:29.497
any step of our

1546
00:32:29.497 --> 00:32:30.536
workflow that we need
