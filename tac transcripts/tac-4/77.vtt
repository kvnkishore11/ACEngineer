1847
00:38:29.257 --> 00:38:30.556
was created in one

1848
00:38:30.556 --> 00:38:31.396
shot. We now have

1849
00:38:31.396 --> 00:38:32.775
JSON L support. So

1850
00:38:32.976 --> 00:38:34.054
that's there. That was

1851
00:38:34.054 --> 00:38:35.175
created on this branch,

1852
00:38:35.315 --> 00:38:36.534
on this machine. We

1853
00:38:36.534 --> 00:38:37.594
set up the four

1854
00:38:37.594 --> 00:38:38.793
elements and this happened

1855
00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:39.793
end to end. And

1856
00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:40.373
I just wanna stress

1857
00:38:40.373 --> 00:38:41.092
this one more time.

1858
00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:42.172
It doesn't matter if

1859
00:38:42.172 --> 00:38:43.452
you use GitHub issues,

1860
00:38:43.492 --> 00:38:44.911
if you like JIRA

1861
00:38:44.911 --> 00:38:47.211
tasks, Notion boards, whatever

1862
00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:48.351
you wanna use. The

1863
00:38:48.351 --> 00:38:48.990
key is that these

1864
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.170
four elements are always

1865
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.050
there and you want

1866
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.670
to build systems that

1867
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.550
build the system for

1868
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.769
you. That's the key

1869
00:38:54.769 --> 00:38:55.829
here. That's the key

1870
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:56.989
piece of information from

1871
00:38:56.989 --> 00:38:58.327
this lesson before we

1872
00:38:58.327 --> 00:38:59.148
push this to the

1873
00:38:59.148 --> 00:39:00.007
next level. And what
