00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.608
into the future of

310
00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:01.966
Agentic coding, while other

311
00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:03.365
engineers are sitting at

312
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:04.762
their device, prompting back

313
00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:05.382
and forth and back

314
00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:06.800
and forth, wasting time

315
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.057
on problems their agents

316
00:08:08.057 --> 00:08:09.076
could solve. While they're

317
00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:10.194
doing this, you'll have

318
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.026
built a new agentic

319
00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:13.485
layer around your code

320
00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:14.725
base where you stay

321
00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:15.603
out the loop and

322
00:08:15.603 --> 00:08:17.144
let your product build

323
00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:18.322
itself. In order to

324
00:08:18.322 --> 00:08:20.103
build Outloop systems, we

325
00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:22.341
need AFK agents, agents

326
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.682
that run while we're

327
00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:24.920
away from the keyboard.

328
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.201
There are four elements

329
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:27.800
of AFK agents we

330
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.139
need to build our

331
00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:30.478
Outloop system. This is
