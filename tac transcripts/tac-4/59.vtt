comment on the GitHub

1391
00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:31.969
issue. or we are

1392
00:29:32.068 --> 00:29:33.887
checking the error, okay?

1393
00:29:33.887 --> 00:29:35.487
And so in between

1394
00:29:35.487 --> 00:29:36.526
all of our logging

1395
00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:38.184
and reporting, we're just

1396
00:29:38.204 --> 00:29:39.763
running the individual steps

1397
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:41.363
of our ADW, okay?

1398
00:29:41.462 --> 00:29:42.442
So here's that classify

1399
00:29:42.442 --> 00:29:43.101
issue. We can go

1400
00:29:43.101 --> 00:29:43.461
ahead and look at

1401
00:29:43.461 --> 00:29:45.099
that, right? Classify issue,

1402
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.358
check this out. This

1403
00:29:46.358 --> 00:29:47.439
is our prompt that

1404
00:29:47.439 --> 00:29:48.278
we're running as a

1405
00:29:48.278 --> 00:29:49.257
slash command. And we're

1406
00:29:49.257 --> 00:29:50.915
just going step-by-step. We're

1407
00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:51.935
isolating all of our

1408
00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:52.934
prompts so that we

1409
00:29:52.934 --> 00:29:54.413
can improve them. No

1410
00:29:54.413 --> 00:29:55.673
ad hoc prompts as

1411
00:29:55.673 --> 00:29:56.892
strings inside of the

1412
00:29:56.892 --> 00:29:58.770
codebase. Everything's isolated

1413
00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.270
so that we can

1414
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.809
improve it. We have
