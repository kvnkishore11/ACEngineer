450
00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:01.846
me with information how

451
00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:04.225
it works. Okay. Chores

452
00:11:04.245 --> 00:11:05.284
are the simplest unit

453
00:11:05.284 --> 00:11:06.184
of engineering work that

454
00:11:06.184 --> 00:11:07.403
your agent should be

455
00:11:07.403 --> 00:11:08.562
taking off your plate

456
00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:09.602
with no debate at

457
00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:10.542
all. So let's kick

458
00:11:10.542 --> 00:11:11.642
off this ADW and

459
00:11:11.642 --> 00:11:12.961
let's watch what happens

460
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:14.379
inside of the agent

461
00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:15.460
environment inside of this

462
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.719
device here that we

463
00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:17.239
can see. So I'm

464
00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:17.778
going to kick this

465
00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.496
off. We're going to

466
00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:20.277
create a brand new

467
00:11:20.277 --> 00:11:22.015
issue here and check

468
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:22.855
this out right away.

469
00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:23.855
Your agent is getting

470
00:11:23.955 --> 00:11:25.313
to work for us.

471
00:11:25.313 --> 00:11:26.138
So If we click

472
00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:27.277
here, we can see

473
00:11:27.277 --> 00:11:28.956
we're getting GitHub issue

474
00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.095
comments. We're getting a
