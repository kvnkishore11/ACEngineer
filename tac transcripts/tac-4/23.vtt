00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.095
comments. We're getting a

475
00:11:30.095 --> 00:11:31.333
live feed of the

476
00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:32.753
progress of our agent.

477
00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:33.772
You can see it's

478
00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:35.770
classified the issue as

479
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.909
a chore. In our

480
00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:38.249
previous lesson, we looked

481
00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:39.607
at chores, bugs, and

482
00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:40.746
features. This is how

483
00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:42.706
we can specialize certain

484
00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:43.845
agents and certain prompts

485
00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:45.464
to solve different problems

486
00:11:45.484 --> 00:11:46.482
in your codebase,

487
00:11:46.482 --> 00:11:46.942
right? So we have

488
00:11:46.942 --> 00:11:48.142
a brand new branch

489
00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:49.240
and it's starting to

490
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.320
work on the implementation

491
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.879
plan. You can see

492
00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.938
the software developer lifecycle

493
00:11:52.938 --> 00:11:54.985
planner has taken over

494
00:11:55.044 --> 00:11:55.825
and it's going to

495
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:56.804
start shipping. This is

496
00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:57.823
all running on this

497
00:11:57.823 --> 00:11:59.043
device here. As you

498
00:11:59.043 --> 00:12:00.082
can see here, it's
