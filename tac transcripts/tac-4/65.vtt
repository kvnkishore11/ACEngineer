1546
00:32:29.497 --> 00:32:30.536
workflow that we need

1547
00:32:30.536 --> 00:32:32.175
to automate engineering work.

1548
00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:33.355
All right. So this

1549
00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:34.273
is all here. This

1550
00:32:34.273 --> 00:32:34.653
is going to set

1551
00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:35.685
up a great base

1552
00:32:35.685 --> 00:32:36.464
framework for you to

1553
00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:38.683
understand ADWs and build

1554
00:32:38.683 --> 00:32:39.163
them into your own

1555
00:32:39.163 --> 00:32:40.364
codebases. All right.

1556
00:32:40.603 --> 00:32:41.123
So that's what this

1557
00:32:41.123 --> 00:32:41.702
is doing. There's going

1558
00:32:41.702 --> 00:32:42.442
to call the build

1559
00:32:42.442 --> 00:32:43.481
prompt. There's going to

1560
00:32:43.481 --> 00:32:44.582
call the write slash

1561
00:32:44.621 --> 00:32:46.240
command with the planner

1562
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.180
agent. And after that,

1563
00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.519
right, we just continue

1564
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.479
the flow. We then

1565
00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:51.597
tap into whatever next

1566
00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:52.337
step we want, right?

1567
00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:52.936
So if we scroll

1568
00:32:52.936 --> 00:32:53.797
down from here, we're

1569
00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:55.516
checking errors. We're continuously

1570
00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:56.994
updating on what the

1571
00:32:56.994 --> 00:32:57.934
issue is on what's

1572
00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:58.855
coming next. And we're

1573
00:32:58.855 --> 00:33:00.778
making it observable. A
