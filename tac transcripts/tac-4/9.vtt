172
00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.355
leverage points of agentic

173
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:31.536
coding. There are 12

174
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:32.795
leverage points of agentic

175
00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:34.276
coding you can use

176
00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:35.894
to maximize your agent's

177
00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:37.795
ability to execute your

178
00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:39.473
engineering work. Remember, the

179
00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:40.374
goal is to become

180
00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:42.372
an irreplaceable engineer by

181
00:04:42.372 --> 00:04:46.089
building increasingly self-operating machines.

182
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.790
In order to get

183
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.629
where we're trying to

184
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.548
go, in order to

185
00:04:48.548 --> 00:04:50.607
become irreplaceable, we need

186
00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:52.526
high leverage agents that

187
00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.285
can do real engineering

188
00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:55.843
work in one shot

189
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:56.663
that we can run

190
00:04:56.843 --> 00:04:57.802
back to back to

191
00:04:57.802 --> 00:04:59.062
back to back. Right?

192
00:04:59.062 --> 00:04:59.942
We want the longest

193
00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:01.821
hot streak possible of
