1994
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:30.260
agentic layer in your

1995
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.559
codebase so your

1996
00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:32.998
agents can run and

1997
00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:34.577
ship engineering work based

1998
00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:36.356
on your engineering problems,

1999
00:41:36.356 --> 00:41:37.295
based on your code

2000
00:41:37.315 --> 00:41:38.514
base, all right? By

2001
00:41:38.514 --> 00:41:40.213
doing this, by dedicating

2002
00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:41.512
and focusing really hard

2003
00:41:41.512 --> 00:41:42.152
on these, you know,

2004
00:41:42.172 --> 00:41:44.610
two essential directories, .clawed

2005
00:41:44.731 --> 00:41:47.014
commands, aka wherever your

2006
00:41:47.014 --> 00:41:48.652
prompts are stored and

2007
00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.132
ADWs also known as

2008
00:41:50.152 --> 00:41:52.389
compositional workflows are stored,

2009
00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:53.670
right? Your agentic workflows,

2010
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.588
your agentic pipelines, your

2011
00:41:55.588 --> 00:41:57.306
ADWs, AI developer workflows.

2012
00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:58.447
So many names for

2013
00:41:58.447 --> 00:41:59.425
the same thing, right?

2014
00:41:59.425 --> 00:42:00.045
You wanna focus on
