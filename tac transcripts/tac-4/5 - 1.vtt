91
00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.727
loop systems and most

92
00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:31.806
fail to recognize the

93
00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:33.106
trend that there are

94
00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.406
increasingly more chores, bugs,

95
00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.150
and features that don't

96
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.269
require your expertise at

97
00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.707
all. If you encode

98
00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:42.087
them, they're sitting on

99
00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:43.326
their device in the

100
00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.606
loop, prompting back and

101
00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:45.385
forth and back and

102
00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:46.806
forth, burning their precious

103
00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:48.085
time on work that

104
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.064
could be handed off

105
00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:50.243
to the right team

106
00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:51.324
of agents in the

107
00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:52.682
right order with the

108
00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.002
right templates. This is

109
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.600
classical in-loop agentic coding.

110
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.400
And then there's of

111
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.758
course Outloop. Outloop agentic
