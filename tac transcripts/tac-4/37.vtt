823
00:18:28.813 --> 00:18:30.333
run slash install and

824
00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.232
let's get this code

825
00:18:31.232 --> 00:18:32.153
base set up so

826
00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:32.992
whenever you run these

827
00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:33.833
commands and new code

828
00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:35.491
bases always always you

829
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.652
know check out what

830
00:18:36.652 --> 00:18:37.491
is actually inside the

831
00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:38.652
file you can see

832
00:18:38.652 --> 00:18:40.031
here we've added a

833
00:18:40.031 --> 00:18:41.211
little bit more to

834
00:18:41.211 --> 00:18:42.510
this install command for

835
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.711
this codebase we're

836
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:45.631
reading reading and executing

837
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.470
we're running several steps

838
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.470
we need to unset

839
00:18:49.685 --> 00:18:51.144
the remote origin here,

840
00:18:51.144 --> 00:18:51.663
set up a new

841
00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:52.923
GitHub repo so that

842
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.382
you can use your

843
00:18:54.382 --> 00:18:55.461
own GitHub issues and

844
00:18:55.461 --> 00:18:56.560
PRs. You, of course,

845
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:57.960
can't make PRs to

846
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.898
this codebase. It

847
00:18:58.898 --> 00:18:59.938
needs to be reusable.
