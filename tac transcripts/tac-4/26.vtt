544
00:12:58.605 --> 00:13:00.024
our planner as the

545
00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:01.703
prompt for our implementer.

546
00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:02.224
So you can see

547
00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:03.504
how all these elements,

548
00:13:03.504 --> 00:13:05.004
every piece of our

549
00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:06.624
ADW, our AI developer

550
00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:07.302
workflow, it all depends

551
00:13:07.302 --> 00:13:09.383
on the fundamental principles

552
00:13:09.462 --> 00:13:10.363
of AI coding and

553
00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:11.283
of agentic coding. These

554
00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:12.822
ideas, these concepts, they

555
00:13:12.822 --> 00:13:13.822
don't go anywhere. They

556
00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:15.621
go everywhere, right? These

557
00:13:15.621 --> 00:13:16.182
are ideas that will

558
00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:17.501
always exist and we

559
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:18.501
need to Pay attention

560
00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:19.721
to them with each

561
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:21.061
prompt, with each agent.

562
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.759
The details are everything.

563
00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:23.440
There's a reason why

564
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.379
a lot of agent

565
00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:25.339
encoding tools don't work.

566
00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:26.057
It's because they don't

567
00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:28.018
understand your codebase.

568
00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:28.937
They don't understand how

569
00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:29.976
you work. And by

570
00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.416
encoding them into our
