1922
00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:00.989
for your codebase,

1923
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.708
they solve classes of

1924
00:40:02.708 --> 00:40:03.728
problems that you no

1925
00:40:03.728 --> 00:40:05.047
longer have to solve.

1926
00:40:05.047 --> 00:40:06.367
You don't immediately start

1927
00:40:06.367 --> 00:40:08.007
with top tier agent

1928
00:40:08.007 --> 00:40:09.005
code and KPIs. You're

1929
00:40:09.005 --> 00:40:09.505
gonna run some of

1930
00:40:09.505 --> 00:40:10.666
these, you're gonna run

1931
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:11.385
some ADWs, you're gonna

1932
00:40:11.385 --> 00:40:12.485
run some prompts, some

1933
00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:13.684
templates that don't fully

1934
00:40:13.684 --> 00:40:14.744
solve the problem. Then

1935
00:40:15.003 --> 00:40:15.802
you'll spend some time,

1936
00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:16.983
you'll invest in your

1937
00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:18.262
templates, and then you'll

1938
00:40:18.262 --> 00:40:19.862
compose them into your

1939
00:40:19.922 --> 00:40:21.581
ADWs and you'll improve.

1940
00:40:21.721 --> 00:40:22.280
This is the new

1941
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.039
layer, the compositional unit

1942
00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:24.880
that I highly, highly

1943
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.039
recommend that you focus

1944
00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:27.199
on now. Don't sit

1945
00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:28.018
and prompt back and

1946
00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:29.277
forth build up these

1947
00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:30.717
workflows, your agent can
