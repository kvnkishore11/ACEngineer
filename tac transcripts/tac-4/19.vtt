WEBVTT

376
00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:30.344
have this configured here.

377
00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:31.344
All the information you

378
00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:32.342
need to set up

379
00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:33.961
your own workflow using

380
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:34.682
the elements I'm going

381
00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:35.422
to run here are

382
00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:36.201
going to be linked

383
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.160
in your loot box.

384
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:37.821
But I recommend you

385
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:39.039
just watch to start

386
00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:39.899
and follow along at

387
00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:40.840
a high level. Don't

388
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.778
get bogged down in

389
00:09:41.778 --> 00:09:42.958
the configuration of this.

390
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.138
Just watch this through

391
00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:45.721
first. and then start

392
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:46.899
setting up your four

393
00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.238
elements. That's the trigger.

394
00:09:48.238 --> 00:09:49.096
I have a GitHub

395
00:09:49.096 --> 00:09:50.115
web hook set up.

396
00:09:50.196 --> 00:09:50.914
And then for the

397
00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:51.953
environment, I'm going to

398
00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:52.913
use this Mac mini

399
00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:53.971
here that my agent

400
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.331
has full control over.

401
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.230
If we open up

402
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.788
screen sharing, you can

403
00:09:57.788 --> 00:09:59.187
see I have an

404
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.804
agent ready and waiting,
