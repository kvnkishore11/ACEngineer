2140
00:44:29.507 --> 00:44:30.806
out the loop. Focus

2141
00:44:30.806 --> 00:44:32.045
on this new agentic

2142
00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:33.309
layer. this new outer

2143
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:34.148
layer on your code

2144
00:44:34.148 --> 00:44:35.128
base so that your

2145
00:44:35.128 --> 00:44:37.146
product ships itself. We

2146
00:44:37.146 --> 00:44:38.045
now have a tactic

2147
00:44:38.065 --> 00:44:39.105
that guides us toward

2148
00:44:39.105 --> 00:44:40.405
building autonomous systems. When

2149
00:44:40.405 --> 00:44:40.844
you stay out the

2150
00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.682
loop, you prioritize agentic

2151
00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:44.282
coding. We solve problem

2152
00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:45.501
classes and we build

2153
00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.760
a system that builds

2154
00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.539
a system, right? Our

2155
00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:49.398
systems, this agentic layer

2156
00:44:49.398 --> 00:44:50.737
is solving the detailed

2157
00:44:50.737 --> 00:44:52.396
problems while we're teaching

2158
00:44:52.396 --> 00:44:53.195
it how to. In

2159
00:44:53.195 --> 00:44:53.735
a lot of ways,

2160
00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:54.853
we're automating the central

2161
00:44:54.853 --> 00:44:56.313
units of the software

2162
00:44:56.313 --> 00:44:57.472
developer lifecycle so that

2163
00:44:57.472 --> 00:44:58.552
we can focus on

2164
00:44:58.672 --> 00:44:59.690
what we want, the

2165
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.150
planning and the reviewing.
