718
00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.225
a PR back to

719
00:16:30.225 --> 00:16:31.783
our review system and

720
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.481
we reviewed the PR.

721
00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:34.740
So here we just

722
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.200
have two steps of

723
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.918
the software developer lifecycle

724
00:16:38.057 --> 00:16:39.336
fully automated end to

725
00:16:39.336 --> 00:16:39.995
end. I hope you

726
00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:41.014
can see how powerful

727
00:16:41.014 --> 00:16:42.053
this can be, right?

728
00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:44.212
just halfway through TAC,

729
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.572
we can automate the

730
00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:46.772
key steps of the

731
00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.370
software developer lifecycle. Obviously,

732
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:48.931
we're gonna take this

733
00:16:48.931 --> 00:16:50.071
a lot further. We're

734
00:16:50.071 --> 00:16:50.870
gonna push this, but

735
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.230
right now, let's dive

736
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.448
into the details of

737
00:16:53.448 --> 00:16:54.369
how this works so

738
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:55.389
that we can see

739
00:16:55.428 --> 00:16:57.128
the ADW, AI developer

740
00:16:57.128 --> 00:16:59.027
workflows are in fact

741
00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:01.485
a composition of key
