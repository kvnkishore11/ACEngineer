go from prompt to

237
00:06:00.932 --> 00:06:02.411
pr in lesson three

238
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.370
you learn to template

239
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.211
your engineering investing in

240
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.610
your templates is mission

241
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.591
critical for outloop agentic

242
00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:09.689
coding because when you

243
00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.230
template your engineering you

244
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.449
encode your engineering solutions

245
00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.887
into your codebases

246
00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:16.586
for your agents. Notice

247
00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:17.466
how it keeps stressing

248
00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:18.944
the uniqueness and the

249
00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:20.144
ownership of your code

250
00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:21.884
base and your agents

251
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:22.882
as much as the

252
00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.521
big gen AI companies

253
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.360
building these Outloop apps

254
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.379
and tools want you

255
00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.038
to believe this one

256
00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:30.757
size does not fit
