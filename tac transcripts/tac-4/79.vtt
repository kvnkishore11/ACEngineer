1898
00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:30.041
dedicated environment. I highly,

1899
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.440
highly recommend you do

1900
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:31.978
this. You want a

1901
00:39:31.978 --> 00:39:34.478
dedicated environment. that your

1902
00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:35.697
agent can run in

1903
00:39:35.836 --> 00:39:36.896
on its own. This

1904
00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:37.715
way you can create

1905
00:39:37.715 --> 00:39:39.295
a GitHub issue anywhere

1906
00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:40.054
you want, or you

1907
00:39:40.054 --> 00:39:40.894
can fire off a

1908
00:39:40.894 --> 00:39:42.014
prompt input that hits

1909
00:39:42.014 --> 00:39:43.014
a trigger that then

1910
00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:43.893
kicks off your agentic

1911
00:39:43.893 --> 00:39:45.672
workflows no matter where

1912
00:39:45.672 --> 00:39:46.711
they're running. All right,

1913
00:39:46.711 --> 00:39:47.751
this is super key,

1914
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:49.190
super important. We have

1915
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.590
two units of engineering

1916
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.349
work that happened agentically

1917
00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:53.748
for our codebase,

1918
00:39:53.748 --> 00:39:55.208
for the TAC4 code

1919
00:39:55.208 --> 00:39:56.547
base. That's the key,

1920
00:39:56.547 --> 00:39:58.286
ADWs and the prompt

1921
00:39:58.306 --> 00:39:59.806
templates you build out

1922
00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:00.989
for your codebase,
