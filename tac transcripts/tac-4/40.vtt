901
00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:00.436
of course, you know,

902
00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:01.676
get access to issues

903
00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:03.317
and PRs to satisfy

904
00:20:03.317 --> 00:20:04.436
the prompt input and

905
00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:05.876
the review system elements

906
00:20:05.977 --> 00:20:07.175
of AFK agent. So

907
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:07.596
I'm gonna go ahead

908
00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:08.115
and do this right

909
00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:08.875
now. If you're following

910
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:09.655
along, you're gonna wanna

911
00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:10.455
do the same, create

912
00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:11.536
a new GitHub repo

913
00:20:11.675 --> 00:20:12.615
and you know, set

914
00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:13.815
up and run these

915
00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:14.974
commands. So I am

916
00:20:14.974 --> 00:20:16.295
operating on the type

917
00:20:16.295 --> 00:20:17.015
four codebase. So

918
00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:17.894
I'm going to reuse

919
00:20:17.894 --> 00:20:19.115
the same URL. So

920
00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:19.714
I'm gonna run this

921
00:20:19.714 --> 00:20:20.933
here. This of course

922
00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:21.693
won't work for you.

923
00:20:21.693 --> 00:20:23.653
Okay, so this looks

924
00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:24.817
great. Let's have our

925
00:20:24.817 --> 00:20:25.497
agent kick off a

926
00:20:25.497 --> 00:20:26.557
workflow for us. So

927
00:20:26.737 --> 00:20:27.696
how does this new

928
00:20:27.715 --> 00:20:28.675
agentic layer of our

929
00:20:28.675 --> 00:20:29.556
codebase work? It

930
00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:31.115
all happens here, as
