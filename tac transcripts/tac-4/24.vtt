498
00:11:59.043 --> 00:12:00.082
can see here, it's

499
00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:01.581
posting comments and it's

500
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:03.341
working through the current

501
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.760
implementation plan right now.

502
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.899
So this device, this

503
00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:08.099
agent is doing this

504
00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:09.778
work autonomously for us.

505
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:10.538
Not only that, we're

506
00:12:10.538 --> 00:12:11.677
getting a nice live

507
00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:13.456
feed of what's actually

508
00:12:13.456 --> 00:12:15.475
happening. By separating our

509
00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:16.695
agents, we're able to

510
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.054
isolate the big three

511
00:12:18.054 --> 00:12:19.333
context model in prompt

512
00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:20.857
to solve one problem

513
00:12:20.857 --> 00:12:22.177
and solve one problem

514
00:12:22.337 --> 00:12:23.576
well. Just in these

515
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.456
four steps, we have

516
00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:26.917
several micro agents doing

517
00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.076
their work, solving a

518
00:12:28.076 --> 00:12:29.517
specific problem well, right?

519
00:12:29.537 --> 00:12:29.876
So we had a

520
00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:31.895
prompt to classify this
