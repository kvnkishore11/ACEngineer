1464
00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:00.056
you and I are

1465
00:31:00.056 --> 00:31:01.096
doing on the ground

1466
00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:02.516
every day. But now

1467
00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:03.076
we can add this

1468
00:31:03.076 --> 00:31:04.236
new agentic layer and

1469
00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:05.096
then we can augment

1470
00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:06.555
and automate a lot

1471
00:31:06.555 --> 00:31:07.835
of these processes, right?

1472
00:31:07.835 --> 00:31:09.775
That's our branch functionality.

1473
00:31:10.234 --> 00:31:11.214
And then we have

1474
00:31:11.714 --> 00:31:12.894
our build plan. So

1475
00:31:12.894 --> 00:31:13.513
let's go into build

1476
00:31:13.513 --> 00:31:14.294
plan. And let me

1477
00:31:14.294 --> 00:31:14.834
show you what one

1478
00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:15.673
of these methods actually

1479
00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.173
looks like. We're building

1480
00:31:17.173 --> 00:31:18.573
a template request, right?

1481
00:31:18.573 --> 00:31:18.952
So we have our

1482
00:31:18.952 --> 00:31:20.413
agent name, the slash

1483
00:31:20.432 --> 00:31:21.652
command, right? And remember

1484
00:31:21.652 --> 00:31:23.071
the slash command activates

1485
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:24.051
the right prompt and

1486
00:31:24.051 --> 00:31:24.830
then the arguments that

1487
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.270
go into the prompt,

1488
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.869
right? Specifying the model

1489
00:31:27.869 --> 00:31:29.230
when you run this

1490
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.829
and when you set

1491
00:31:29.829 --> 00:31:30.650
up your ADWs, I
