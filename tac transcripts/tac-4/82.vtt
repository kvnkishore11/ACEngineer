1970
00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:00.869
up your reusable prompts,

1971
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:01.989
right? Your templates, your

1972
00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:03.327
meta prompts, and then

1973
00:41:03.407 --> 00:41:05.244
creating some ADWs that

1974
00:41:05.445 --> 00:41:06.324
once you set these

1975
00:41:06.324 --> 00:41:07.302
up, they're just there,

1976
00:41:07.463 --> 00:41:08.302
right? You know, for

1977
00:41:08.302 --> 00:41:10.099
this codebase, this

1978
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:12.137
just solves entire classes

1979
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.516
of engineering problems now

1980
00:41:13.516 --> 00:41:15.114
moving forward, right? You

1981
00:41:15.114 --> 00:41:16.849
just solve that. these

1982
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:18.028
types of problems, they're

1983
00:41:18.028 --> 00:41:19.027
just solved. All I

1984
00:41:19.027 --> 00:41:19.588
have to do is

1985
00:41:19.588 --> 00:41:20.626
write the prompt, the

1986
00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:21.885
high level prompt, not

1987
00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:22.945
even the plan, okay?

1988
00:41:23.244 --> 00:41:23.844
So I hope you

1989
00:41:23.844 --> 00:41:24.485
can see things coming

1990
00:41:24.505 --> 00:41:25.764
together here. There's a

1991
00:41:25.764 --> 00:41:26.782
lot to dissect, but

1992
00:41:26.782 --> 00:41:27.601
the idea here is

1993
00:41:27.601 --> 00:41:29.081
simple. Build a new

1994
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:30.260
agentic layer in your
