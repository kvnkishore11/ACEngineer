00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.804
agent ready and waiting,

405
00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:02.682
looking for requests from

406
00:10:02.682 --> 00:10:03.846
the web hook right

407
00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:04.586
here and we'll dive

408
00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:05.525
into exactly how this

409
00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:06.605
works in just a

410
00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:07.904
moment but this is

411
00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:09.245
our environment we're looking

412
00:10:09.245 --> 00:10:10.865
into this device right

413
00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:12.384
here and when we

414
00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:13.423
kick off our prompt

415
00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:14.344
input you're going to

416
00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:15.384
see this start up

417
00:10:15.384 --> 00:10:15.903
and boot up in

418
00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:16.823
just a moment here

419
00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:17.583
and then of course

420
00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:18.484
our review system is

421
00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:19.623
going to be github

422
00:10:19.842 --> 00:10:21.182

423
00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:22.342
our agent finishes the

424
00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:23.802
work we've asked for

425
00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:24.761
with the prompt input

426
00:10:25.022 --> 00:10:25.881
it's going to turn

427
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:26.822

428
00:10:26.822 --> 00:10:28.125
in its environment and

429
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.025
