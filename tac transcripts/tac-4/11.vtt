213
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.149
to your templates and

214
00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:31.269
to your agents. Your

215
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.608
current velocity is fractions

216
00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:34.048
of what it will

217
00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:35.427
be when your agents

218
00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:36.487
are doing all the

219
00:05:36.487 --> 00:05:37.545
heavy lifting for you

220
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.704
because you've learned to

221
00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:41.384
stay out the loop

222
00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:42.684
and build the system

223
00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.182
that builds the system.

224
00:05:44.382 --> 00:05:45.283
Staying out the loop

225
00:05:45.422 --> 00:05:47.093
sounds great. how does

226
00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:48.413
it actually work and

227
00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:49.634
how can we differentiate

228
00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:50.452
from the plug and

229
00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:52.273
play outloop agentic coding

230
00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:53.572
tools that already exist

231
00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:54.632
with everything you've learned

232
00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:55.812
so far here in

233
00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.151
tech we can automate

234
00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:58.552
nearly half the software

235
00:05:58.552 --> 00:05:59.971
development life cycle and

236
00:05:59.971 --> 00:06:00.932
