1316
00:27:59.452 --> 00:28:00.892
everything and just run

1317
00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:01.951
to the main method.

1318
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:03.151
What's important right now

1319
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:04.410
is that you understand

1320
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.009
that you can put

1321
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:06.748
together these composable units

1322
00:28:06.748 --> 00:28:09.446
of classic deterministic code

1323
00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:10.984
with these new units

1324
00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:12.604
of intelligence with our

1325
00:28:12.604 --> 00:28:14.603
Claude Code agentic coding

1326
00:28:14.803 --> 00:28:15.761
agent. It's all about

1327
00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:17.361
that. And then reporting,

1328
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:18.160
making sure that our

1329
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.659
process is observable and

1330
00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.438
understandable from a higher

1331
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:22.868
level. It doesn't matter

1332
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:23.489
if our agent can

1333
00:28:23.489 --> 00:28:24.768
solve every problem if

1334
00:28:24.768 --> 00:28:25.606
we don't know that

1335
00:28:25.606 --> 00:28:26.746
it's solved. We need

1336
00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:27.565
to observe, we need

1337
00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:28.663
to report, we need

1338
00:28:28.663 --> 00:28:29.843
to log and monitor.

1339
00:28:29.982 --> 00:28:30.722
What we have here
