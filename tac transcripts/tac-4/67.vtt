1597
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.549
basis. This workflow has

1598
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:31.469
completed, right? And you

1599
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:32.348
can see all the

1600
00:33:32.348 --> 00:33:33.528
agents, all the little

1601
00:33:33.528 --> 00:33:35.227
micro to macro agents

1602
00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:36.586
inside this ADW that

1603
00:33:36.586 --> 00:33:38.224
have completed branch generator,

1604
00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:40.462
issue classifier, PR creator,

1605
00:33:40.663 --> 00:33:42.102
implementer, planner, right? It's

1606
00:33:42.162 --> 00:33:43.040
all here. And then

1607
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.640
we have the committer

1608
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.419
for the planner and

1609
00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:46.557
the implementer, right? And

1610
00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:47.198
so you can see

1611
00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:48.356
that if we continue

1612
00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:49.276
to scroll down, it's

1613
00:33:49.296 --> 00:33:50.974
all the same process,

1614
00:33:50.974 --> 00:33:53.403
right? Run either non-deterministic

1615
00:33:53.403 --> 00:33:55.299
intelligence or a deterministic

1616
00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.278
step. We then check

1617
00:33:56.278 --> 00:33:57.733
for issues, do some

1618
00:33:57.733 --> 00:33:59.070
logging, do some reporting,

1619
00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:00.108
and then we continue.
