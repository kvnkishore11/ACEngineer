2188
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.699
that. We're going to

2189
00:45:30.699 --> 00:45:32.219
close the loops. We're

2190
00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:32.699
going to give our

2191
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:34.398
agents multiple leverage points

2192
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.916
of agentic coding needed

2193
00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:37.434
to validate their own

2194
00:45:37.554 --> 00:45:38.494
work. We're going to

2195
00:45:38.494 --> 00:45:38.873
teach them how to

2196
00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:39.753
do this on multiple

2197
00:45:39.753 --> 00:45:41.192
dimensions because what's better

2198
00:45:41.192 --> 00:45:42.731
than one test? Yes,

2199
00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:44.329
two, three or 10.

2200
00:45:45.188 --> 00:45:45.688
All right. So in

2201
00:45:45.688 --> 00:45:46.527
lesson five, we teach

2202
00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:47.306
our agents how to

2203
00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:49.065
test and validate not

2204
00:45:49.065 --> 00:45:49.925
just back end work,

2205
00:45:50.085 --> 00:45:50.903
not just scripts, but

2206
00:45:50.903 --> 00:45:51.963
front end and all

2207
00:45:51.963 --> 00:45:53.222
types of engineering. By

2208
00:45:53.222 --> 00:45:54.793
doing this, increase our

2209
00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:56.253
review velocity by teaching

2210
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.572
our agents how to

2211
00:45:57.572 --> 00:45:59.253
validate their work great

2212
00:45:59.253 --> 00:46:00.253
job here you're making
