2014
00:41:59.425 --> 00:42:00.045
You wanna focus on

2015
00:42:00.045 --> 00:42:01.065
these elements and you

2016
00:42:01.065 --> 00:42:02.443
wanna create this outer

2017
00:42:02.443 --> 00:42:03.983
layer to automate the

2018
00:42:04.003 --> 00:42:05.702
different classes of software

2019
00:42:05.702 --> 00:42:06.641
engineering problems that you

2020
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:07.561
have. It makes you

2021
00:42:07.561 --> 00:42:09.119
add logging, add observability.

2022
00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:09.539
You wanna make it

2023
00:42:09.539 --> 00:42:11.278
easy to understand where

2024
00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:11.878
and how things are

2025
00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:13.110
happening, right? We can

2026
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.688
hop into the issue

2027
00:42:13.688 --> 00:42:14.429
and we can see

2028
00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:15.547
this agent completed its

2029
00:42:15.547 --> 00:42:16.407
work. Then we can

2030
00:42:16.407 --> 00:42:17.246
review to make sure

2031
00:42:17.246 --> 00:42:18.146
that it is actually

2032
00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:18.746
done. You want to

2033
00:42:18.746 --> 00:42:19.505
set up the four

2034
00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:21.545
elements of AFK agents,

2035
00:42:21.585 --> 00:42:23.302
prompt input, trigger, environment,

2036
00:42:23.382 --> 00:42:24.943
review system. And this

2037
00:42:24.943 --> 00:42:26.101
enables you when you

2038
00:42:26.101 --> 00:42:27.320
put these things together,

2039
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.119
you can stay out

2040
00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.699
the loop. For example,
