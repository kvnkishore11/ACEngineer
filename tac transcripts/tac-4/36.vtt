WEBVTT

795
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.190
can see we have

796
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.648
the previous three TAC

797
00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:02.788
codebases. Let's go

798
00:18:02.788 --> 00:18:03.807
ahead and get clone

799
00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:05.007
in the lesson for

800
00:18:05.027 --> 00:18:06.126
repository. I'm going to

801
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.486
cd into TAC 4.

802
00:18:07.713 --> 00:18:08.252
and then open up

803
00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:09.491
whatever your favorite ID

804
00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:10.191
is. I'm gonna use

805
00:18:10.211 --> 00:18:11.009
VS Code. Let's go

806
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.630
ahead and boot up

807
00:18:11.648 --> 00:18:12.827
Claude. I'm gonna run

808
00:18:12.928 --> 00:18:14.007
in Yolo mode because

809
00:18:14.007 --> 00:18:15.086
I understand everything this

810
00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:15.924
codebase will and

811
00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:16.824
can do. If you're

812
00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:17.383
ever worried about the

813
00:18:17.383 --> 00:18:18.780
permissions, always check the

814
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.099
settings file and make

815
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:20.979
sure that things can't

816
00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:21.518
run that you don't

817
00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.416
want run. This is

818
00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:23.576
going to add additional

819
00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:26.193
control clear and there's

820
00:18:26.193 --> 00:18:27.034
no reason to run

821
00:18:27.034 --> 00:18:28.393
installation by hand anymore

822
00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:28.813
so i'm going to

823
00:18:28.813 --> 00:18:30.333
run slash install and
