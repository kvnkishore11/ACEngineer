1414
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.809
improve it. We have

1415
00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:01.909
a nice mapping here.

1416
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:02.667
Of course, if you

1417
00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:03.886
have more detailed or

1418
00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:05.605
different classes of problems,

1419
00:30:05.605 --> 00:30:06.404
you just add them

1420
00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.545
here in your classify

1421
00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.804
issue step. And then

1422
00:30:08.804 --> 00:30:09.682
you update your data

1423
00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:11.142
types to support the

1424
00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.221
different types of slash

1425
00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.279
commands that you solve.

1426
00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.439
All right. And again,

1427
00:30:14.459 --> 00:30:15.298
this is just one

1428
00:30:15.298 --> 00:30:16.178
way to build out

1429
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:17.176
an ADW. We're just

1430
00:30:17.176 --> 00:30:17.996
walking through this so

1431
00:30:17.996 --> 00:30:19.295
you can understand how

1432
00:30:19.295 --> 00:30:19.994
you can build these

1433
00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:20.794
out for your code

1434
00:30:20.794 --> 00:30:21.992
base, for your problem,

1435
00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.432
for your application, for

1436
00:30:23.432 --> 00:30:24.092
your team, for your

1437
00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:25.070
users. Right. So there's

1438
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.442
that. We then We

1439
00:30:26.442 --> 00:30:27.221
create a Git branch

1440
00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:28.461
and again, it's the

1441
00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:30.101
same process, right? Git
