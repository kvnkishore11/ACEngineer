670
00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.274
this workflow, cron, and

671
00:15:30.274 --> 00:15:31.774
then the build step.

672
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.948
and then the actual

673
00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:33.988
ADW, which we're gonna

674
00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:35.187
dive into in just

675
00:15:35.187 --> 00:15:36.846
a moment, environment variables,

676
00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:38.125
prerequisites, so on and

677
00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:38.924
so forth, right? So

678
00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:39.943
there are no limits

679
00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:41.143
here, right? Your ADWs

680
00:15:41.143 --> 00:15:43.162
can operate on your

681
00:15:43.182 --> 00:15:44.539
ADWs. So, you know,

682
00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:45.559
don't get too meta,

683
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.418
let's keep it simple.

684
00:15:46.418 --> 00:15:48.337
You can see more

685
00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:49.756
details there. And then

686
00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:50.515
of course we have

687
00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:52.174
the plan, right? This

688
00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:53.453
plan was built by

689
00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.893
our planner agent and

690
00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:55.672
then handed off to

691
00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:56.730
our implementer agent. So

692
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.850
this was the, literally

693
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.446
the prompt for our

694
00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:00.745
implementer agent. So you
