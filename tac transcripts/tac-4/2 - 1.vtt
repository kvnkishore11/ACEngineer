00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.774
literally designed for everyone's

31
00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:03.454
codebases, not yours.

32
00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:04.733
Just like the prompt,

33
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.864
Your agentic pipeline is

34
00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:08.704
too valuable to outsource

35
00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:09.844
to a third party

36
00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.963
tool, especially this early

37
00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:13.463
in phase two of

38
00:01:13.463 --> 00:01:15.063
the generative AI age.

39
00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:16.063
You want to own

40
00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:17.462
your agentic pipelines. You

41
00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:18.003
want to be able

42
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:19.201
to slice and dice

43
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:21.162
your agents across your

44
00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:23.121
codebases, across the

45
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.361
software developer lifecycle with

46
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.721
ease. In this lesson,

47
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.200
we put together the

48
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.721
plan and build step

49
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.921
of the software developer
