930
00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:31.115
all happens here, as

931
00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:32.075
you could guess, in

932
00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:34.413
the ADW's directory. Let's

933
00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:35.853
finish configuring and getting

934
00:20:35.853 --> 00:20:36.971
everything set up, and

935
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:37.971
then we'll run this.

936
00:20:37.991 --> 00:20:39.011
So in the dot

937
00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:40.590
environment variable file, the

938
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.529
key thing you need

939
00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:43.393
here is these two.

940
00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:43.932
So you're going to

941
00:20:43.932 --> 00:20:44.272
need to set up

942
00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:45.632
your Anthropic API key.

943
00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.230
The agent SDK currently

944
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.469
only runs with the

945
00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:49.489
API key. This may

946
00:20:49.489 --> 00:20:50.468
change in the future.

947
00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:50.867
Keep your eye out

948
00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:51.527
for that. I'll make

949
00:20:51.527 --> 00:20:52.526
sure there's links in

950
00:20:52.526 --> 00:20:53.585
your loop box mentioning

951
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:54.545
if that's changed at

952
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:55.263
all. But so I'm

953
00:20:55.263 --> 00:20:56.202
going to set this

954
00:20:56.202 --> 00:20:57.083
and for your cloud

955
00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.142
code path, depending on

956
00:20:58.142 --> 00:20:59.681
your configuration, this might

957
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:00.579
not work right away.
