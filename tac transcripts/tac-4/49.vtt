WEBVTT

1136
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.170
runs properly. We posted

1137
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.388
a health check onto

1138
00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:32.209
the comment. There it

1139
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:33.409
is. And we are

1140
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:34.167
good to go. We're

1141
00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:35.367
good to run our

1142
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:36.667
AI developer workflow. So

1143
00:24:36.807 --> 00:24:37.607
let's kick this off

1144
00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:38.366
and then let's break

1145
00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:39.527
it down. So if

1146
00:24:39.527 --> 00:24:40.287
we open up the

1147
00:24:40.287 --> 00:24:41.385
top of our ADW

1148
00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:42.445
plan build, we only

1149
00:24:42.445 --> 00:24:43.953
have one, ADW in

1150
00:24:43.953 --> 00:24:45.392
this codebase, just

1151
00:24:45.392 --> 00:24:46.051
the plan and the

1152
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.391
build. Remember we're automating

1153
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:48.150
the plan and build

1154
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.608
step of the software

1155
00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:50.847
developer lifecycle. And then

1156
00:24:50.847 --> 00:24:51.448
we can see the

1157
00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.606
exact same thing, right?

1158
00:24:52.606 --> 00:24:53.365
So super simple to

1159
00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.464
kick off. We have

1160
00:24:54.605 --> 00:24:57.002
UV run this, okay?

1161
00:24:57.143 --> 00:24:58.461
These scripts, right? These

1162
00:24:58.461 --> 00:24:59.240
single file scripts can

1163
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.040
be anything you want
