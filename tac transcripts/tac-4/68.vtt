1619
00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:00.108
and then we continue.

1620
00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:00.747
Now we're committing the

1621
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:01.910
plan. Here's a git

1622
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.648
commit. And then we're

1623
00:34:02.648 --> 00:34:04.108
implementing the solution. There

1624
00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:05.387
it is. Plan file

1625
00:34:05.468 --> 00:34:06.627
on and on and

1626
00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:07.487
on, right? There's the

1627
00:34:07.487 --> 00:34:08.487
git commit for the

1628
00:34:08.487 --> 00:34:10.146
implementation. Then we're building

1629
00:34:10.146 --> 00:34:11.485
out the pull request

1630
00:34:11.585 --> 00:34:12.704
right here. This is

1631
00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:14.164
our PR creator. If

1632
00:34:14.164 --> 00:34:14.784
we tap this, we

1633
00:34:14.784 --> 00:34:15.983
can see all the

1634
00:34:15.983 --> 00:34:17.123
logs that our PR

1635
00:34:17.123 --> 00:34:18.402
creator went through, right?

1636
00:34:18.402 --> 00:34:19.202
So we have JSONL

1637
00:34:19.202 --> 00:34:20.400
here and we have

1638
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:21.980
JSON for more easy

1639
00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.679
readable format. So this

1640
00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.858
is all here. This

1641
00:34:24.858 --> 00:34:25.559
is how this ADW

1642
00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:26.958
works. We'll dive into

1643
00:34:26.958 --> 00:34:28.137
the details and we'll

1644
00:34:28.137 --> 00:34:29.257
play with these composable

1645
00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:30.835
units as you progress
