1749
00:36:29.295 --> 00:36:30.735
prompt. There we go.

1750
00:36:30.954 --> 00:36:32.134
Nothing different there. Order

1751
00:36:32.134 --> 00:36:33.873
by descending looks great.

1752
00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:34.733
And now let's go

1753
00:36:34.733 --> 00:36:36.072
ahead and try to

1754
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.889
upload some. Okay, so

1755
00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:38.429
let's check this out.

1756
00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.528
Our UI got updated

1757
00:36:39.728 --> 00:36:41.726
CSV, JSON or JSON

1758
00:36:41.726 --> 00:36:42.567
L. That looks great.

1759
00:36:42.686 --> 00:36:43.226
We have a new

1760
00:36:43.226 --> 00:36:44.465
option. We can select

1761
00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:45.505
event analytics. That looks

1762
00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.264
good. Let's go ahead

1763
00:36:46.264 --> 00:36:46.884
and drag and drop

1764
00:36:46.884 --> 00:36:47.643
this in. On that

1765
00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:48.981
PR, it told us

1766
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:50.240
where exactly that was.

1767
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.139
Let's drag and drop

1768
00:36:51.139 --> 00:36:52.340
in that sample data.

1769
00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:53.079
This is gonna be

1770
00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:54.981
in test assets. So

1771
00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:55.681
we can quickly just

1772
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:57.481
find that app server

1773
00:36:57.521 --> 00:36:59.940
tests assets. Let's open

1774
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.601
and finder assets. Here
