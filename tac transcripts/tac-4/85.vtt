2040
00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.699
the loop. For example,

2041
00:42:30.719 --> 00:42:32.077
this is one workflow,

2042
00:42:32.117 --> 00:42:33.237
one Outloop system I

2043
00:42:33.237 --> 00:42:34.157
have set up. This

2044
00:42:34.157 --> 00:42:36.195
device now is always

2045
00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:37.195
running for me. If

2046
00:42:37.195 --> 00:42:37.954
I hop into this

2047
00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:39.425
box, and I kick

2048
00:42:39.465 --> 00:42:40.485
this trigger off again,

2049
00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:41.284
this codebase is

2050
00:42:41.284 --> 00:42:43.143
always listening to whatever

2051
00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:44.164
web hook I have

2052
00:42:44.164 --> 00:42:45.103
set up for any

2053
00:42:45.103 --> 00:42:46.302
codebase now, and

2054
00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:47.123
it will just start

2055
00:42:47.123 --> 00:42:48.242
solving the problem. After

2056
00:42:48.242 --> 00:42:49.222
the upfront, you know,

2057
00:42:49.262 --> 00:42:50.481
install, right? And you

2058
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.481
can encode all the

2059
00:42:51.481 --> 00:42:53.101
installation into a slash

2060
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.500
install command, right? After

2061
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.280
you get the setup,

2062
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.380
you have an agent

2063
00:42:56.539 --> 00:42:57.719
operating its own environment.

2064
00:42:57.719 --> 00:42:59.099
You can call using

2065
00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:01.277
an out loop system.
