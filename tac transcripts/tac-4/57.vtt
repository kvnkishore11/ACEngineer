1339
00:28:29.982 --> 00:28:30.722
What we have here

1340
00:28:30.722 --> 00:28:31.922
in this ADW is

1341
00:28:31.922 --> 00:28:33.121
that exactly. We're putting

1342
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:34.339
together these elements, these

1343
00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:36.397
composable units of agentic

1344
00:28:36.397 --> 00:28:37.797
engineering, and we're letting

1345
00:28:37.797 --> 00:28:39.414
the product build itself

1346
00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:40.554
with this new agentic

1347
00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:41.513
layer around the code

1348
00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:42.613
base. So let's just

1349
00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:43.071
walk through this. It's

1350
00:28:43.071 --> 00:28:45.050
relatively simple. Parsi arguments,

1351
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.305
hashed in, the issue

1352
00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:48.223
number. You can see

1353
00:28:48.223 --> 00:28:49.242
issue number 33 right

1354
00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:50.342
here. And you can

1355
00:28:50.342 --> 00:28:51.261
see the steps that

1356
00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:52.201
our agent is currently

1357
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:53.019
on. If we don't

1358
00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:53.999
have an ADW ID

1359
00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:55.058
passed in, this is

1360
00:28:55.058 --> 00:28:56.517
optional. We make one.

1361
00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:57.557
We're then setting up

1362
00:28:57.557 --> 00:28:58.695
our logger, checking the

1363
00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:00.374
environment variables, and then
