00:34:59.447 --> 00:35:00.646
reported based on our

1670
00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:02.326
PR review prompt. All

1671
00:35:02.326 --> 00:35:03.405
right, this looks great.

1672
00:35:03.405 --> 00:35:04.125
It handles all these

1673
00:35:04.125 --> 00:35:05.824
key features. Comprehensive test

1674
00:35:05.824 --> 00:35:06.822
coverage, love to see

1675
00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:07.342
that. And then we

1676
00:35:07.342 --> 00:35:08.181
can, of course, you

1677
00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:08.981
know, review all this

1678
00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:10.001
code, see the files

1679
00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:11.001
changed, see everything that's

1680
00:35:11.001 --> 00:35:12.519
changed. There's the front

1681
00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:13.838
end UI updated. Here

1682
00:35:13.838 --> 00:35:14.958
is some sample data,

1683
00:35:14.958 --> 00:35:15.858
just like we asked

1684
00:35:15.858 --> 00:35:16.836
for in our tests,

1685
00:35:16.836 --> 00:35:18.516
complex data, sample data,

1686
00:35:18.675 --> 00:35:19.775
and on and on

1687
00:35:19.775 --> 00:35:20.335
and on, all right?

1688
00:35:20.335 --> 00:35:21.175
And of course, very

1689
00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:22.813
importantly, here's the plan.

1690
00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:24.532
right? The planner created

1691
00:35:24.532 --> 00:35:25.851
the plan and outputted

1692
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:27.630
a concrete asset that

1693
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.329
we can use to

1694
00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:29.768
understand what our implementer

1695
00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:30.829
will do. This is
