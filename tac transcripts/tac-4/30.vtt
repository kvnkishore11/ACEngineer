644
00:14:59.828 --> 00:15:00.589
to clean up that

645
00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:01.349
I need to encode,

646
00:15:01.349 --> 00:15:01.869
right, we have a

647
00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:03.508
gentic developer workflow, that's

648
00:15:03.508 --> 00:15:04.628
just wrong. So this

649
00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:05.488
is something that I

650
00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.606
need to improve in

651
00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.346
my prompt to be

652
00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:08.567
clearer about what this

653
00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:09.226
is. But you can

654
00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:10.086
see here, if we

655
00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:11.485
go to files change,

656
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:12.989
we can see just

657
00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:13.947
those files we asked

658
00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.086
for to be updated.

659
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.086
There's the readme. We

660
00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:17.066
can quickly just scroll

661
00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:17.904
through this. I don't

662
00:15:17.904 --> 00:15:18.583
wanna get too hung

663
00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:19.423
up on the details

664
00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:20.543
here, but you can

665
00:15:20.543 --> 00:15:22.322
see we have changes

666
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:23.620
for the readme detailing

667
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.359
exactly how everything works.

668
00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.138
For the ADWs, there's

669
00:15:27.138 --> 00:15:28.437
the webhook that's running

670
00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:30.274
this workflow, cron, and
