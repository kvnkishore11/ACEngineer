1011
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.201
new feature we're going

1012
00:22:00.201 --> 00:22:01.122
to add json l

1013
00:22:01.122 --> 00:22:02.300
support if we upload

1014
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.240
you can see right

1015
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.820
now we can only

1016
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.401
do dot csv or

1017
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.961
dot json so let's

1018
00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.381
kick off this adw

1019
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:09.119
we're going to dive

1020
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.119
into here in just

1021
00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:11.519
a moment to operate

1022
00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:12.500
on this for us

1023
00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:13.500
and so let's go

1024
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.420
ahead and kick this

1025
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.380
off the first thing

1026
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:15.819
we need to do

1027
00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:17.838
of course is write

1028
00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:19.558
the prompt input right

1029
00:22:19.558 --> 00:22:20.398
this is step one

1030
00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:21.358
of the four elements

1031
00:22:21.598 --> 00:22:22.738
of outloop systems of

1032
00:22:22.817 --> 00:22:23.778
afk agents so i'm

1033
00:22:23.778 --> 00:22:24.518
just going to write

1034
00:22:24.518 --> 00:22:25.157
up a prompt here

1035
00:22:25.258 --> 00:22:25.758
this is what our

1036
00:22:25.758 --> 00:22:26.821
prompt is gonna end

1037
00:22:26.821 --> 00:22:27.662
up looking like here.

1038
00:22:27.662 --> 00:22:28.861
We're just adding details.

1039
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:29.540
This is a high
