1573
00:32:58.855 --> 00:33:00.778
making it observable. A

1574
00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.017
couple really key pieces

1575
00:33:02.017 --> 00:33:02.436
here that we're going

1576
00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:03.256
to look at in

1577
00:33:03.256 --> 00:33:04.556
upcoming lessons. We have

1578
00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:06.654
our system reporting individual

1579
00:33:06.674 --> 00:33:07.814
log files on a

1580
00:33:07.814 --> 00:33:09.394
Cloud Code session ID

1581
00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:10.853
basis. So we can

1582
00:33:10.853 --> 00:33:11.573
come in to this

1583
00:33:11.592 --> 00:33:13.592
system, this device, and

1584
00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:15.030
really understand what's going

1585
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:15.930
on here at a

1586
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.430
very, very detailed level.

1587
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.729
We activated this thanks

1588
00:33:18.729 --> 00:33:19.608
to Cloud Code hooks,

1589
00:33:19.608 --> 00:33:20.127
but there are many

1590
00:33:20.127 --> 00:33:21.268
mechanisms to tap into

1591
00:33:21.268 --> 00:33:22.846
this functionality. So that's

1592
00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:23.886
one mechanism in which

1593
00:33:23.886 --> 00:33:25.046
we can observe and

1594
00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:26.413
review. We also have

1595
00:33:26.573 --> 00:33:28.031
agents that run on

1596
00:33:28.031 --> 00:33:29.310
a AI developer workflow

1597
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.549
basis. This workflow has
