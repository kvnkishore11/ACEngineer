2165
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.150
planning and the reviewing.

2166
00:45:01.313 --> 00:45:02.432
Okay. By templating your

2167
00:45:02.432 --> 00:45:03.813
engineering, we increase our

2168
00:45:03.813 --> 00:45:05.452
planning velocity by encoding

2169
00:45:05.452 --> 00:45:07.050
solutions to classes of

2170
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.570
problems into the outer

2171
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.309
layer of our code

2172
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:10.809
base, the agentic layer.

2173
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:11.668
This is great, but

2174
00:45:11.668 --> 00:45:12.329
there is a massive

2175
00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.947
issue. These workflows, although

2176
00:45:13.947 --> 00:45:16.106
powerful, they require lots

2177
00:45:16.106 --> 00:45:17.367
and lots of reviewing

2178
00:45:17.405 --> 00:45:18.545
at some level. We'll

2179
00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:19.704
always need to review,

2180
00:45:19.824 --> 00:45:20.385
but wouldn't it be

2181
00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:21.085
great if we could

2182
00:45:21.164 --> 00:45:23.764
increase our review velocity

2183
00:45:23.764 --> 00:45:24.862
as we scale our

2184
00:45:24.862 --> 00:45:26.661
planning and building velocity

2185
00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:27.822
with our agents. In

2186
00:45:27.822 --> 00:45:28.740
the next lesson, we're

2187
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.880
going to do exactly

2188
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.699
that. We're going to
