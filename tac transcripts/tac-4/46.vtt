WEBVTT

1061
00:22:59.413 --> 00:23:00.711
trigger. All right. So

1062
00:23:00.711 --> 00:23:01.352
we're going to create

1063
00:23:01.352 --> 00:23:02.291
this issue here. And

1064
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.230
now we can reference

1065
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.891
this issue by pooling

1066
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.130
number 33. Let's first.

1067
00:23:07.509 --> 00:23:08.750
validate our environment by

1068
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.989
running this health check

1069
00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:11.009
command. This is something

1070
00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:12.189
I highly recommend you

1071
00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:13.088
build into your ADWs

1072
00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:14.808
before you run, you

1073
00:23:14.808 --> 00:23:16.208
know, your complex or

1074
00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:17.748
simplistic workflow. You just

1075
00:23:17.748 --> 00:23:18.268
want to know that

1076
00:23:18.268 --> 00:23:19.827
everything's configured properly. All

1077
00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:20.987
right. So we can

1078
00:23:20.987 --> 00:23:21.807
do this by opening

1079
00:23:21.807 --> 00:23:22.626
up our health check

1080
00:23:22.787 --> 00:23:24.126
and we can run

1081
00:23:24.267 --> 00:23:25.105
this command. So I'm

1082
00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:25.965
going to copy this

1083
00:23:26.185 --> 00:23:27.882
paste and Then I'm

1084
00:23:27.882 --> 00:23:28.820
gonna kick off this

1085
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.159
health check. These are
