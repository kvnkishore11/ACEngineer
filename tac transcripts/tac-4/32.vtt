694
00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:00.745
implementer agent. So you

695
00:16:00.745 --> 00:16:01.423
can see top to

696
00:16:01.423 --> 00:16:02.423
bottom there exactly what

697
00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:03.383
that looks like. So

698
00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:04.263
this is awesome. This

699
00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.922
all happened with Peter,

700
00:16:06.142 --> 00:16:07.780
the four elements of

701
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.980
AFK agents. For the

702
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.139
prompt input, we use

703
00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.437
GitHub issues. For the

704
00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:12.498
trigger, we set up

705
00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.096
a GitHub web hook.

706
00:16:14.297 --> 00:16:14.836
You can see that

707
00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:15.875
right here. I'm gonna

708
00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:16.914
blur out my URL

709
00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:17.735
here. You can set

710
00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:18.234
up your own web

711
00:16:18.234 --> 00:16:19.313
hook right here. And

712
00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:20.893
then our device operating

713
00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:22.091
right here picked up

714
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.510
on that and ran

715
00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:25.490
our ADW, our plan,

716
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.488
build a developer workflow

717
00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:28.586
and then it submitted

718
00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.225
a PR back to
