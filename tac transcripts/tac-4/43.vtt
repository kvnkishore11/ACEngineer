985
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:30.861
let me quickly refresh

986
00:21:30.861 --> 00:21:31.641
our memory here on

987
00:21:31.641 --> 00:21:32.560
this codebase. We

988
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.019
can execute it with

989
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.199
sh script start. All

990
00:21:36.199 --> 00:21:36.578
right, so this is

991
00:21:36.578 --> 00:21:37.318
going to kick off

992
00:21:37.318 --> 00:21:38.778
our backend and our

993
00:21:38.778 --> 00:21:39.857
front end. There it

994
00:21:39.857 --> 00:21:40.856
is. So let's go

995
00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:41.517
ahead and open this

996
00:21:41.517 --> 00:21:42.416
up. And as you

997
00:21:42.416 --> 00:21:43.415
can see, we have

998
00:21:43.415 --> 00:21:44.516
our classic natural language

999
00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:46.055
interface. We can upload

1000
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:46.875
test data, we can

1001
00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:48.753
get users. We can

1002
00:21:48.753 --> 00:21:49.814
then query these users,

1003
00:21:49.814 --> 00:21:51.452
users age descending. And

1004
00:21:51.452 --> 00:21:52.192
then that query will

1005
00:21:52.192 --> 00:21:53.392
come through here as

1006
00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:54.771
an SQL statement against

1007
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:56.371
our local SQLite database.

1008
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:56.951
It all looks good,

1009
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:57.609
right? So what we

1010
00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.021
wanna do here this

1011
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.201
new feature we're going
