1491
00:31:29.829 --> 00:31:30.650
up your ADWs, I

1492
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.929
highly recommend for your

1493
00:31:31.929 --> 00:31:33.969
build and implement steps,

1494
00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:34.647
right? You build and

1495
00:31:34.647 --> 00:31:35.428
implement, you use the

1496
00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:36.468
most powerful model you

1497
00:31:36.468 --> 00:31:38.527
can just for presentation

1498
00:31:38.527 --> 00:31:39.606
sake. I'm using Sonnet

1499
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:40.146
just cause it's going

1500
00:31:40.146 --> 00:31:40.446
to be a little

1501
00:31:40.446 --> 00:31:41.546
faster, but you're going

1502
00:31:41.546 --> 00:31:42.526
to want to throw

1503
00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:44.596
top models into the

1504
00:31:44.596 --> 00:31:45.977
most complex steps, which

1505
00:31:45.977 --> 00:31:46.356
are going to be

1506
00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:47.096
your plan and your

1507
00:31:47.096 --> 00:31:48.395
build step. Build plan,

1508
00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:49.036
you know, we're just

1509
00:31:49.036 --> 00:31:49.556
going to kick off

1510
00:31:49.556 --> 00:31:50.775
this slash command, run

1511
00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:51.714
some debugging logs, and

1512
00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:52.115
then we're going to

1513
00:31:52.115 --> 00:31:53.473
execute it, okay? And

1514
00:31:53.473 --> 00:31:53.894
all the way at

1515
00:31:53.894 --> 00:31:54.594
the bottom here, the

1516
00:31:54.594 --> 00:31:55.772
execute step is, of

1517
00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:57.272
course, in our agent

1518
00:31:57.432 --> 00:31:59.031
module, which is going

1519
00:31:59.031 --> 00:32:00.271
to build the prompt,
