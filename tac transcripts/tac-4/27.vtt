00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.416
encoding them into our

571
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:33.014
templates and then chaining

572
00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:34.394
our templates, our meta

573
00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:35.774
prompts and our reusable

574
00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.732
prompts together, we get

575
00:13:37.812 --> 00:13:38.952
an ADW that can

576
00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.451
do work like this,

577
00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:41.272
okay? You can see

578
00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:42.551
the solution was implemented

579
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:43.951
and now we're committing

580
00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:46.029
the implementation. Our agent

581
00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:46.928
working on its own

582
00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:48.607
device here is running

583
00:13:48.607 --> 00:13:50.567
through this ADW, this

584
00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:51.785
AI developer workflow. It's

585
00:13:51.785 --> 00:13:53.205
creating a PR. All

586
00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:54.104
this work is happening

587
00:13:54.104 --> 00:13:55.883
without us. Okay. But

588
00:13:55.883 --> 00:13:57.282
it's happening as if

589
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:58.302
we were building it

590
00:13:58.302 --> 00:13:59.880
because we've templated our

591
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.038
engineering. Okay. Success is
