1291
00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:30.804
the right context. Again,

1292
00:27:30.804 --> 00:27:31.284
we did this in

1293
00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:32.502
our previous lesson with

1294
00:27:32.502 --> 00:27:33.782
the slash implement command.

1295
00:27:33.782 --> 00:27:34.382
You can see that

1296
00:27:34.382 --> 00:27:35.382
right here. We're going

1297
00:27:35.382 --> 00:27:36.300
to pass the plan

1298
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.201
in as an argument

1299
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:38.500
and then it executes.

1300
00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:39.180
All right. And then

1301
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.359
finally, of course we

1302
00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.778
create a PR. So

1303
00:27:41.959 --> 00:27:43.518
right here, we're automating

1304
00:27:43.518 --> 00:27:44.916
the first two steps

1305
00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:46.057
of the software developer

1306
00:27:46.057 --> 00:27:47.236
life cycle plan and

1307
00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:48.415
build plan and code

1308
00:27:48.415 --> 00:27:50.474
with this ADW right?

1309
00:27:50.674 --> 00:27:52.413
A developer workflow plan,

1310
00:27:52.577 --> 00:27:53.497
build. Let's break this

1311
00:27:53.497 --> 00:27:54.057
down. You can see

1312
00:27:54.057 --> 00:27:54.796
here at the top,

1313
00:27:54.796 --> 00:27:55.935
we have different agents

1314
00:27:55.935 --> 00:27:57.894
for different specific tasks.

1315
00:27:58.193 --> 00:27:59.452
Let's go ahead, collapse

1316
00:27:59.452 --> 00:28:00.892
everything and just run
