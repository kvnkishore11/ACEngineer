132
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:30.396
models will improve and

133
00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:32.257
tools will change. This

134
00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:34.037
means over time, your

135
00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:34.896
agents will be able

136
00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.316
to solve more and

137
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.096
more problems with every

138
00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:39.515
improvement. When you stay

139
00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:40.415
out the loop, you

140
00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:42.116
leverage this fact, enabling

141
00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.015
you to focus on

142
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:44.634
scaling up what your

143
00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.235
agents can do instead

144
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:47.495
of wasting time doing

145
00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:48.694
the work yourself. You

146
00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.094
build the system that

147
00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:52.014
builds the system. This

148
00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:52.533
is where we need

149
00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.794
to focus. Why is

150
00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:54.957
that? It's because this

151
00:03:54.957 --> 00:03:57.037
directly ties into our

152
00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:58.515
ability to improve our

153
00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.414
agentic coding KPIs. We
