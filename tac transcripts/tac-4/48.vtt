1109
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.059
sense in a moment

1110
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:00.880
here. So let's run

1111
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.079
this health check. This

1112
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:02.559
is going to be

1113
00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:03.419
on issue. What was

1114
00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:04.118
that? 33. Okay. So

1115
00:24:04.118 --> 00:24:05.259
we're going to run

1116
00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:07.459
on issue 33 and

1117
00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:08.759
let's see if we

1118
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:09.378
have everything set up

1119
00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:11.478
properly. So environment path

1120
00:24:11.518 --> 00:24:12.857
is set up. GitHub

1121
00:24:12.857 --> 00:24:14.534
repository looks good. We

1122
00:24:14.534 --> 00:24:15.314
do get a warning.

1123
00:24:15.314 --> 00:24:16.013
This is a warning

1124
00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:17.593
for you, the viewer.

1125
00:24:17.593 --> 00:24:18.353
If you're still pointing

1126
00:24:18.353 --> 00:24:20.051
toward the original attack

1127
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:20.852
for less encodebase,

1128
00:24:20.852 --> 00:24:21.311
you're going to need

1129
00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:22.271
to update this, right?

1130
00:24:22.271 --> 00:24:22.652
So that you have

1131
00:24:22.652 --> 00:24:23.590
access to your own

1132
00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:25.050
pull requests and you

1133
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.490
know, issues and whatnot.

1134
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.650
So that's good. We

1135
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.529
can see Claude Code

1136
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.170
runs properly. We posted
