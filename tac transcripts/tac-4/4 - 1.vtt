00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.451
consistent results in complex

70
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:04.052
codebases across hundreds

71
00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:05.691
of agent executions and

72
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.891
now here in lesson

73
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:09.031
four you stay out

74
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.191
the loop what does

75
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:11.151
it mean to stay

76
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.050
out the loop there

77
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.849
are two types of

78
00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.729
agentic coding both powerful

79
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.250
both relevant but one

80
00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.150
lets you hand off

81
00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.808
exponentially more work to

82
00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:20.028
your agents. You've of

83
00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:21.449
course heard of human

84
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:22.408
in the loop. When

85
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.288
it comes to agentic

86
00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:24.147
coding, this is what

87
00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:25.527
most engineers are doing

88
00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:26.707
right now. The tech

89
00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:28.527
ecosystem has become obsessed

90
00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:29.287
with human in the

91
00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.727
loop systems and most
