520
00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:31.895
prompt to classify this

521
00:12:31.895 --> 00:12:33.015
work for spending up

522
00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:33.635
a new branch. And

523
00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:34.556
then of course we

524
00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:35.716
have an implementation plan.

525
00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:36.716
And so our planner,

526
00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:37.176
you can see our

527
00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:38.434
planner is completely done.

528
00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:39.875
It's committed its work

529
00:12:39.914 --> 00:12:40.934
right here. We can

530
00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:41.654
see that it's created

531
00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:42.774
a brand new spec

532
00:12:42.774 --> 00:12:44.553
file agentically. And now

533
00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:45.894
our implementer agent is

534
00:12:45.894 --> 00:12:47.354
going to start implementing

535
00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:48.885
the solution. So its

536
00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:50.405
context window is completely

537
00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:51.884
free. We can select

538
00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:53.184
a more powerful model,

539
00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:54.144
which I recommend you

540
00:12:54.144 --> 00:12:55.225
do for the implementation.

541
00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:55.804
And we can, of

542
00:12:55.804 --> 00:12:57.365
course, use the plan

543
00:12:57.404 --> 00:12:58.605
that was created by

544
00:12:58.605 --> 00:13:00.024
our planner as the
