741
00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:01.485
a composition of key

742
00:17:01.485 --> 00:17:02.385
primitives that we can

743
00:17:02.385 --> 00:17:03.485
work with to build

744
00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:05.424
an agentic layer around

745
00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:06.784
any codebase you

746
00:17:06.784 --> 00:17:07.863
operate in. So keep

747
00:17:07.863 --> 00:17:08.663
in mind as we

748
00:17:08.663 --> 00:17:09.603
work through this that

749
00:17:09.643 --> 00:17:11.781
these four elements They

750
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.921
can be anything, right?

751
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:13.661
I'm not here to

752
00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:14.601
tell you what tool

753
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:15.619
or what environments to

754
00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.798
use, right? What sandboxes

755
00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:18.598
to put your agents

756
00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:19.278
in. I'm here to

757
00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:20.198
give you a top-notch

758
00:17:20.198 --> 00:17:21.617
framework and tactics you

759
00:17:21.617 --> 00:17:22.477
need so that you

760
00:17:22.477 --> 00:17:23.457
can build a system

761
00:17:23.596 --> 00:17:24.596
that works for your

762
00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:26.195
codebases, your products,

763
00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:27.355
and your team. You

764
00:17:27.355 --> 00:17:28.214
will, and you should

765
00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.174
have opinions about how

766
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.473
to structure your AFK
