WEBVTT

1363
00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:00.374
environment variables, and then

1364
00:29:00.374 --> 00:29:01.452
we're getting our GitHub

1365
00:29:01.452 --> 00:29:02.771
repo. We have different

1366
00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:03.891
modules, of course, that

1367
00:29:03.891 --> 00:29:04.730
we're pulling in data

1368
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.628
types, GitHub and agent.

1369
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:07.548
Then we fetch the

1370
00:29:07.548 --> 00:29:09.247
issue from GitHub, right?

1371
00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:09.626
So this is gonna

1372
00:29:09.646 --> 00:29:11.241
pull in. title, our

1373
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:12.161
description so that we

1374
00:29:12.161 --> 00:29:13.320
have the actual issue

1375
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:13.881
and we can see

1376
00:29:13.881 --> 00:29:15.079
this type very plainly

1377
00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:16.000
here, right? We've just

1378
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.858
got this all typed

1379
00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:17.659
out. The key thing

1380
00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:19.058
here is the title

1381
00:29:19.058 --> 00:29:20.238
and body. All right.

1382
00:29:20.238 --> 00:29:20.938
And then we have

1383
00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.517
this pattern of either

1384
00:29:22.517 --> 00:29:23.656
reporting the issue. You

1385
00:29:23.656 --> 00:29:24.375
can see all the

1386
00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:25.655
issue comments here and

1387
00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:26.455
by issue, I mean

1388
00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:27.875
the issue comment, right?

1389
00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:28.934
So we're adding a

1390
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.034
comment on the GitHub
