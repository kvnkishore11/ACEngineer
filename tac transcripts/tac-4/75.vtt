1800
00:37:29.043 --> 00:37:30.143
that exact same naming

1801
00:37:30.143 --> 00:37:32.757
convention as specified. This

1802
00:37:32.757 --> 00:37:33.876
was a feature that

1803
00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:34.835
an engineer may have

1804
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:35.554
taken up, may have

1805
00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:36.791
picked up themselves, and

1806
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.570
it was completely unnecessary,

1807
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.867
okay? I can guarantee

1808
00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:41.385
you right now, you

1809
00:37:41.385 --> 00:37:42.284
or an engineer on

1810
00:37:42.284 --> 00:37:43.523
your team, you're working

1811
00:37:43.523 --> 00:37:44.521
on things, you can

1812
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:46.280
fully automate by creating

1813
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.858
an agentic layer around

1814
00:37:47.858 --> 00:37:48.836
your codebase that

1815
00:37:48.836 --> 00:37:49.835
is driven by the

1816
00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:51.474
four elements of AFK

1817
00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:53.132
agents. Right. And doing

1818
00:37:53.132 --> 00:37:54.092
all this will help

1819
00:37:54.092 --> 00:37:55.291
you stay out the

1820
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:56.170
loop. There is no

1821
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.130
reason to do engineering

1822
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.248
work like this. And

1823
00:37:58.248 --> 00:37:59.887
this trend will continue.
