766
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.473
to structure your AFK

767
00:17:30.473 --> 00:17:31.653
agents. Don't read into

768
00:17:31.653 --> 00:17:32.492
how this is configured

769
00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:34.011
too much. Focus on

770
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.692
the composable units. All

771
00:17:35.692 --> 00:17:36.951
right, so let's dive

772
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:37.931
into this. Let's run

773
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:39.190
this again, only this

774
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.382
time, Let me go

775
00:17:40.382 --> 00:17:41.421
ahead and kill the

776
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:42.000
web hook so we

777
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.799
don't get this kicked

778
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:43.400
off. So I'm going

779
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.459
to disable this agent

780
00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.057
here because this time

781
00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:47.178
we're going to update

782
00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:48.676
so that our environment

783
00:17:48.896 --> 00:17:50.195
is my local device

784
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:51.275
and my trigger will

785
00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:52.134
be a local script

786
00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.094
will run right out

787
00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:53.913
of the TAC 4

788
00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:55.073
codebase. So let's

789
00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:55.512
go ahead and open

790
00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:56.392
up the terminal. And

791
00:17:56.392 --> 00:17:56.811
this is a great

792
00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:57.711
place to follow along

793
00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:58.871
if you're interested. If

794
00:17:58.871 --> 00:17:59.550
we type ls, you

795
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.190
can see we have
