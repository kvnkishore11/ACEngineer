1824
00:38:00.047 --> 00:38:01.146
OK, this is not

1825
00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:01.985
specific to this code

1826
00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:03.405
base. Yes. Right now

1827
00:38:03.405 --> 00:38:04.304
it is small, but

1828
00:38:04.304 --> 00:38:05.242
it doesn't matter. The

1829
00:38:05.242 --> 00:38:07.021
size only matters so

1830
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:08.500
much. OK. And every

1831
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.400
time you miss something,

1832
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.039
what do you do?

1833
00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:10.777
You don't fix the

1834
00:38:10.777 --> 00:38:12.420
issue. you fix the

1835
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.858
system that caused the

1836
00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.757
issue, right? You fix

1837
00:38:14.757 --> 00:38:15.914
your templates, you fix

1838
00:38:15.914 --> 00:38:17.373
your ADW. Okay, so

1839
00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:18.590
anyway, let's finish testing

1840
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.688
this. Sample data, all

1841
00:38:20.688 --> 00:38:23.422
rows, age between 10

1842
00:38:23.422 --> 00:38:24.998
and 50. Okay, so

1843
00:38:25.157 --> 00:38:25.998
just a random query

1844
00:38:25.998 --> 00:38:27.297
to just showcase that

1845
00:38:27.317 --> 00:38:28.257
all of our data

1846
00:38:28.257 --> 00:38:29.257
is here. This feature

1847
00:38:29.257 --> 00:38:30.556
was created in one
