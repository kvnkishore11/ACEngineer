00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:01.277
an out loop system.

2066
00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:03.317
This is massive impact.

2067
00:43:03.336 --> 00:43:04.197
I recommend you take

2068
00:43:04.197 --> 00:43:05.177
action on this now.

2069
00:43:05.177 --> 00:43:06.335
Like don't wait, the

2070
00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:08.255
ROI here is insane.

2071
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:08.675
I want you to

2072
00:43:08.675 --> 00:43:09.815
get to the aha

2073
00:43:09.894 --> 00:43:11.135
light bulb moment you'll

2074
00:43:11.135 --> 00:43:12.315
get when you run

2075
00:43:12.394 --> 00:43:13.054
one of these end

2076
00:43:13.054 --> 00:43:13.733
to end, all right?

2077
00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:14.614
Start with something simple,

2078
00:43:14.653 --> 00:43:15.153
you know, get everything

2079
00:43:15.153 --> 00:43:16.313
configured and fire off

2080
00:43:16.313 --> 00:43:17.132
a chore. What you

2081
00:43:17.132 --> 00:43:17.932
wanna do is understand

2082
00:43:17.932 --> 00:43:20.211
how controllable this is.

2083
00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:21.132
Yes, it's true. There

2084
00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:22.610
are cloud-based tools that

2085
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.170
do this workflow, but

2086
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.471
that's not exactly true.

2087
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.789
These tools are not

2088
00:43:26.789 --> 00:43:29.144
running your templates, right?

2089
00:43:29.144 --> 00:43:30.204
They're not running your
