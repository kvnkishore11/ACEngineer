you to trigger your

12
00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.786
agents to run in

13
00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.585
their own environment. By

14
00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:33.985
the end of this

15
00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:35.585
lesson, you'll know exactly

16
00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.003
how to replace and

17
00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:40.302
outperform modern cloud-based agentic

18
00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:42.301
coding tools like Copilot,

19
00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.180
Devon, Jules, Codex, and

20
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.460
other in-the-cloud coding agents.

21
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.380
These tools are great.

22
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.420
I've used them all,

23
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.159
but they lack the

24
00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.439
detail needed to ship

25
00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:52.357
end-to-end in your code

26
00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:53.978
base with your engineering

27
00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:56.936
practices for your domain-specific

28
00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:58.396
problem. They all have

29
00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.716
natural limits because they're

30
00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.774
literally designed for everyone's
