1441
00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:30.101
same process, right? Git

1442
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:31.900
branch is created by

1443
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.578
our branch PR. Notice

1444
00:30:33.578 --> 00:30:35.239
how with every one

1445
00:30:35.239 --> 00:30:36.518
of these templates, we're

1446
00:30:36.518 --> 00:30:39.096
encoding our engineering into

1447
00:30:39.096 --> 00:30:40.317
reusable prompts that our

1448
00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:41.556
agent can tap into,

1449
00:30:41.615 --> 00:30:42.836
okay? And this is

1450
00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:43.955
all about that same

1451
00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:45.154
idea, that same tactic.

1452
00:30:45.234 --> 00:30:46.035
We need to adopt

1453
00:30:46.035 --> 00:30:47.773
our agent's perspective behind

1454
00:30:47.773 --> 00:30:48.617
that We need to

1455
00:30:48.617 --> 00:30:49.678
give our agent our

1456
00:30:49.678 --> 00:30:51.057
perspective, right? They need

1457
00:30:51.057 --> 00:30:51.717
to see what we

1458
00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:52.696
would see when we're

1459
00:30:52.696 --> 00:30:54.576
solving that specific step

1460
00:30:54.737 --> 00:30:55.636
of the AI developer

1461
00:30:55.636 --> 00:30:57.616
workflow, right? Because previously,

1462
00:30:57.676 --> 00:30:58.476
these are just developer

1463
00:30:58.476 --> 00:30:59.316
workflows. This is what

1464
00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:00.056
you and I are
