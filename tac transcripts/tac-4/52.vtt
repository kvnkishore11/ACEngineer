WEBVTT

1216
00:25:58.381 --> 00:26:00.200
done, we've already encoded

1217
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.519
into our codebase

1218
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.419
via our reasonable prompts,

1219
00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:04.218
our templates and our

1220
00:26:04.218 --> 00:26:05.337
meta prompts, right? That's

1221
00:26:05.337 --> 00:26:06.497
all here. We'll walk

1222
00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:07.297
through these in just

1223
00:26:07.297 --> 00:26:08.176
a moment here. So

1224
00:26:08.237 --> 00:26:08.915
if we hop back

1225
00:26:08.915 --> 00:26:10.256
to the issue, you

1226
00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:11.095
can see our agent

1227
00:26:11.095 --> 00:26:12.194
is updating this live,

1228
00:26:12.194 --> 00:26:13.634
just like our previous.

1229
00:26:13.634 --> 00:26:14.253
The issue has been

1230
00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:15.972
classified as a feature.

1231
00:26:16.012 --> 00:26:16.752
So instead of running

1232
00:26:16.752 --> 00:26:17.791
the chore, it's going

1233
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.050
to run the feature

1234
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.049
here. This feature template

1235
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.709
meta prompt is going

1236
00:26:21.709 --> 00:26:22.409
to build out a

1237
00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:24.366
entirely different set of

1238
00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:26.226
instructions and a different

1239
00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:27.565
template for our agent

1240
00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.403
to fill out and

1241
00:26:28.403 --> 00:26:29.542
operate on. We can

1242
00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:31.241
target specific classes of
