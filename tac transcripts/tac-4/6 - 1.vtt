00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.758
course Outloop. Outloop agentic

112
00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.257
coding is off-device agentic

113
00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:04.195
coding. It's when you

114
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:05.514
write high to low-level

115
00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:07.014
prompts that you pass

116
00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:08.133
off to your agentic

117
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.072
pipeline, then you go

118
00:03:10.132 --> 00:03:12.211
AFK, away from keyboard.

119
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.930
You walk away from

120
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.068
your keyboard, or maybe

121
00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.128
you were never there

122
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.168
in the first place.

123
00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:16.787
Maybe you sent the

124
00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:17.887
prompt right from your

125
00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:19.844
phone on GitHub, Slack,

126
00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.443
Notion, Jira, a text

127
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:23.143
message, or any third-party

128
00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:24.102
tool. Stay out the

129
00:03:24.102 --> 00:03:25.538
loop, is a tactic

130
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.978
of agentic coding that

131
00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.796
reinforces the fact that

132
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:30.396
models will improve and
