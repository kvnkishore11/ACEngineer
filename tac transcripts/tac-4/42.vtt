957
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:00.579
not work right away.

958
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:01.039
So you need to

959
00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.999
run something like this,

960
00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:04.602
which cloud copy this

961
00:21:04.801 --> 00:21:05.800
and just paste this

962
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.141
in your environment variable

963
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:08.240
right here. I'm going

964
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.880
to set these up.

965
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.380
I'm going to cut

966
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:09.779
this part of the

967
00:21:09.779 --> 00:21:11.460
video, obviously. So the

968
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.398
environment variables are set

969
00:21:12.398 --> 00:21:13.078
up for the top

970
00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:14.098
level. That's great. Now,

971
00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:14.917
before we dive into

972
00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:16.077
this, let's go ahead

973
00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:17.758
and create a prompt

974
00:21:17.817 --> 00:21:18.977
input for this workflow

975
00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:19.997
to run on this

976
00:21:19.997 --> 00:21:20.777
device. So we'll go

977
00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:22.056
ahead, open up GitHub

978
00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:23.236
issues. We'll hit new

979
00:21:23.236 --> 00:21:24.954
issue here and let's

980
00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:25.875
have our agent build

981
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:26.815
out a new feature

982
00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:27.434
for us. So I'm

983
00:21:27.434 --> 00:21:28.554
going to type just

984
00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:29.981
on L support. And

985
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:30.861
let me quickly refresh
