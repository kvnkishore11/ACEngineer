2114
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.030
and your ADW and

2115
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.168
your system that you're

2116
00:44:01.168 --> 00:44:02.586
building. Start templating out

2117
00:44:02.586 --> 00:44:03.467
the chore for your

2118
00:44:03.467 --> 00:44:04.405
codebase, then move

2119
00:44:04.405 --> 00:44:05.344
up to bugs. And

2120
00:44:05.344 --> 00:44:06.943
then eventually, you know,

2121
00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:07.623
you'll get to the

2122
00:44:07.623 --> 00:44:08.561
feature level. Right. But

2123
00:44:08.561 --> 00:44:09.400
you can definitely start

2124
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.300
small with just the

2125
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.518
chore. You know, these

2126
00:44:11.518 --> 00:44:13.293
are simple tasks. You

2127
00:44:13.293 --> 00:44:13.954
know you can hand

2128
00:44:13.954 --> 00:44:14.713
off, then move to

2129
00:44:14.713 --> 00:44:16.293
bugs, and then full-on

2130
00:44:16.293 --> 00:44:17.831
features. Use this code

2131
00:44:17.831 --> 00:44:18.751
base as a great

2132
00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:20.110
starting point for understanding

2133
00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.150
how you can build

2134
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:22.530
ADWs in your code

2135
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:23.989
base, right? There's engineering

2136
00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:24.768
work that you just

2137
00:44:24.789 --> 00:44:26.248
truly don't need to

2138
00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:27.807
do anymore. So template

2139
00:44:27.807 --> 00:44:29.447
your engineering and stay

2140
00:44:29.507 --> 00:44:30.806
out the loop. Focus
