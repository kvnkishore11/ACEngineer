272
00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:01.956
engineering, the ADW is

273
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.355
how you create this

274
00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:05.793
new agentic layer around

275
00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:06.973
your codebase. It's

276
00:07:06.973 --> 00:07:08.812
the synthesis of previous

277
00:07:08.812 --> 00:07:11.351
generation deterministic code and

278
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.250
new generation non-deterministic language

279
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.009
models, prompt chains, and

280
00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:17.848
now agents. The ADW

281
00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:19.067
can be thought of

282
00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:20.687
as an agentic pipeline

283
00:07:20.747 --> 00:07:22.504
or very loosely speaking

284
00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:24.303
an agentic workflow. In

285
00:07:24.303 --> 00:07:25.762
the future these will

286
00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:26.262
just be known as

287
00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:28.060
scripts and will fully

288
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.759
expect agentic behavior by

289
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.899
default. We're creating a
