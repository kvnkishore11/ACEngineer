591
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.038
engineering. Okay. Success is

592
00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:03.339
absolutely planned. You can

593
00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:04.738
plan success into your

594
00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:06.136
codebase by templating

595
00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.155
your engineering. Here comes

596
00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:08.355
the PR. There it

597
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.653
is. Okay. So ADW.

598
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:12.278
completed. If we scroll

599
00:14:12.278 --> 00:14:12.658
up, we can see

600
00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:13.437
how long that took.

601
00:14:13.496 --> 00:14:15.014
This simple task took

602
00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:15.773
a total of five

603
00:14:15.773 --> 00:14:16.591
minutes. And you can

604
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:17.849
see our agents did

605
00:14:17.908 --> 00:14:18.706
all the work there.

606
00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:19.485
All we did was

607
00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:20.364
define the work that

608
00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:21.621
we want done. and

609
00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:22.260
gave it a little

610
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.100
bit of detail, right?

611
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.421
So this is a

612
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:24.639
high level prompt that

613
00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:25.458
gets turned into a

614
00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:26.717
plan, right? So it's

615
00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:28.596
expanded. Our agent is

616
00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:29.796
filling in the details

617
00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:30.894
of our chore, just
