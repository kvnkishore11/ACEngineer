1085
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.159
health check. These are

1086
00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:32.057
all single file scripts,

1087
00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:32.836
by the way. The

1088
00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:34.374
ADW directory is really

1089
00:23:34.374 --> 00:23:36.251
important because it operates

1090
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.490
as a unit around

1091
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.409
your codebase. Notice

1092
00:23:38.409 --> 00:23:39.988
how app is completely

1093
00:23:39.988 --> 00:23:41.306
untouched here. We're not

1094
00:23:41.306 --> 00:23:43.344
combining or conflating the

1095
00:23:43.344 --> 00:23:44.862
functionality between these two.

1096
00:23:44.981 --> 00:23:46.801
the ADWs combined with

1097
00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:47.981
your prompts, as you'll

1098
00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:48.541
see in a moment

1099
00:23:48.582 --> 00:23:49.461
here, you can see

1100
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.300
all of these reusable

1101
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.181
prompts that feel the

1102
00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:53.641
ADWs, these two directories

1103
00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:55.240
and their content form

1104
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.099
the agentic layer around

1105
00:23:56.099 --> 00:23:57.160
your codebase. So

1106
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.680
let's run the health

1107
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.779
check. We'll dive into

1108
00:23:58.779 --> 00:23:59.480
this. It'll all make

1109
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.059
sense in a moment
