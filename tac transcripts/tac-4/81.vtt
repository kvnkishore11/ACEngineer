1947
00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:30.717
workflows, your agent can

1948
00:40:30.717 --> 00:40:32.617
solve many, many problems

1949
00:40:32.617 --> 00:40:33.677
that you and others

1950
00:40:33.777 --> 00:40:35.137
are still wasting your

1951
00:40:35.157 --> 00:40:36.956
time building. Okay. I

1952
00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:38.036
want to be really

1953
00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:38.597
blunt here. I want

1954
00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:39.157
to help you get

1955
00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:40.135
ahead. And that means

1956
00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:41.976
addressing the faults of

1957
00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:42.956
where we currently are.

1958
00:40:42.956 --> 00:40:44.076
All right. In loop

1959
00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:45.476
agentic coding is great

1960
00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.974
for experimentation. It's great

1961
00:40:46.974 --> 00:40:48.655
for exploring new territory

1962
00:40:48.795 --> 00:40:49.735
and it's great for

1963
00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:51.135
very, very hard, very

1964
00:40:51.135 --> 00:40:53.253
specific problems. Okay. But

1965
00:40:53.253 --> 00:40:54.313
let's be real. Most

1966
00:40:54.313 --> 00:40:55.634
of engineering is not

1967
00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:57.213
that. So, If you

1968
00:40:57.213 --> 00:40:58.273
invest a little bit

1969
00:40:58.273 --> 00:40:59.391
of time here, setting

1970
00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:00.869
up your reusable prompts,
