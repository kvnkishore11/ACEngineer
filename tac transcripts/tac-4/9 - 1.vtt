00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.521
Here in TAC, Tactical

174
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.721
Agent of Coding, we're

175
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.740
obviously capitalizing on this

176
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.478
opportunity before it hits

177
00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:36.358
the masses. We're not

178
00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:37.737
playing today's game, we're

179
00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:39.317
playing tomorrow's. You might

180
00:04:39.317 --> 00:04:40.197
be thinking about how

181
00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:42.036
error-prone LLMs and agents

182
00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:43.454
can be or how

183
00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.514
AI can't possibly ship

184
00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:47.452
your special snowflake work

185
00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:48.651
end to end. Let

186
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:49.692
me say this bluntly

187
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.230
and clearly. If you

188
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.670
are not wrong now,

189
00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:53.942
you will be. It's

190
00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:55.380
only a matter of

191
00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:57.199
time. Remember, tools will

192
00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.959
change and models will

193
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.197
improve. That means engineers,
