694
00:17:29.772 --> 00:17:31.192
and fire off Claude Code

695
00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:31.852
from one of these

696
00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:32.691
scripts. I'm going to

697
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.411
go ahead and run

698
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.210
Python with Astral UV.

699
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.690
I'm just going to

700
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.789
copy this. I'm going

701
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:37.388
to open up a

702
00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:38.949
brand new terminal instance

703
00:17:38.949 --> 00:17:40.167
back into main. If

704
00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:41.688
we open up programmable

705
00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:42.807
you'll see these three

706
00:17:42.807 --> 00:17:44.008
scripts and you'll also

707
00:17:44.048 --> 00:17:44.988
have the prompt that's

708
00:17:44.988 --> 00:17:46.087
going to run inside

709
00:17:46.087 --> 00:17:47.087
of every one of

710
00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:48.247
these scripts that's going

711
00:17:48.247 --> 00:17:49.507
to call clog code

712
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.007
in a programmable fashion

713
00:17:51.007 --> 00:17:51.626
you can see here's

714
00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:52.826
the python version here's

715
00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:54.086
the shell version and

716
00:17:54.086 --> 00:17:55.507
here's the bun typescript

717
00:17:55.547 --> 00:17:56.547
version so before we

718
00:17:56.547 --> 00:17:57.267
kick this off let's

719
00:17:57.267 --> 00:17:58.106
go ahead clear up

720
00:17:58.106 --> 00:17:59.047
that branch and run

721
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.166
git branch we can
