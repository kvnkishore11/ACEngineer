441
00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:30.216
So let's open up

442
00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:31.456
Cloud Code here, copy

443
00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:32.416
the contents from the

444
00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:33.835
AI coding prompt, paste

445
00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:34.774
it right in, fire

446
00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:35.855
it off. This first

447
00:11:35.855 --> 00:11:37.833
prompt represents what can

448
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.778
be done with AI

449
00:11:38.778 --> 00:11:40.836
coding at a foundational

450
00:11:40.856 --> 00:11:42.177
level. You've seen this

451
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:43.216
a million times already.

452
00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:44.316
Claude Code here is

453
00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:45.255
just going to create

454
00:11:45.255 --> 00:11:46.135
this file. We now

455
00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:47.196
have this new main

456
00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:48.955
file with the print

457
00:11:49.034 --> 00:11:50.355
that we expect. This

458
00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:51.494
is nothing new. This

459
00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:52.813
is AI coding. We

460
00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:53.313
can do this at

461
00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.432
scale. We can get

462
00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.572
tons of files generated

463
00:11:55.572 --> 00:11:56.413
for us. We can

464
00:11:56.413 --> 00:11:57.273
have our agents and

465
00:11:57.273 --> 00:11:58.912
our LLMs generate code

466
00:11:58.912 --> 00:12:00.511
for us. This represents
