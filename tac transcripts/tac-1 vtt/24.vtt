466
00:11:58.912 --> 00:12:00.511
for us. This represents

467
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.870
phase one. Let's talk

468
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.971
about phase two and

469
00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:03.850
what's different. If we

470
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.211
scroll down here, you'll

471
00:12:05.211 --> 00:12:07.230
see the Agentic Coding

472
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.352
prompt. Let's go ahead,

473
00:12:08.472 --> 00:12:09.371
copy this and do

474
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:10.011
the same thing. Just

475
00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:11.650
kick this off. You're

476
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.230
likely already familiar with

477
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.729
this log code, setting

478
00:12:14.729 --> 00:12:16.008
up a checklist, setting

479
00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:17.147
up a plan for

480
00:12:17.147 --> 00:12:17.846
what we're going to

481
00:12:17.846 --> 00:12:18.566
do. And then it's

482
00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.144
executed all of these

483
00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:21.543
steps one by one

484
00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:22.922
by one. This second

485
00:12:22.922 --> 00:12:24.561
prompt represents what can

486
00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:26.039
be done with agentic

487
00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:27.538
coding at a foundational

488
00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:29.197
level. You've likely already

489
00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:30.956
been running Agentic Coding
