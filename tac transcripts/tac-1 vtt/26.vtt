511
00:12:59.486 --> 00:13:00.866
new main tack file.

512
00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:01.527
We can open that

513
00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:03.225
up, main tack. We

514
00:13:03.225 --> 00:13:04.662
have a print. hello

515
00:13:04.662 --> 00:13:06.201
agentic coding world. And

516
00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:06.860
we have a print

517
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:08.841
describing what AI agents

518
00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:09.860
are. We then ran

519
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.840
our previous AI coding

520
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.058
prompt, got the output,

521
00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:13.379
goodbye AI coding. And

522
00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:14.119
then we ran our

523
00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:15.258
main tack files. You

524
00:13:15.258 --> 00:13:15.937
can see the output

525
00:13:15.937 --> 00:13:17.298
there, git add, git

526
00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:18.836
commit, Claude Code, cleaned

527
00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:19.756
up the to-do list

528
00:13:19.777 --> 00:13:20.995
and reported what's been

529
00:13:20.995 --> 00:13:23.056
done. This is Agentic

530
00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:24.414
Coding. With AI coding,

531
00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:25.894
you've been interacting with

532
00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:27.774
the big three, context,

533
00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:29.660
model, prompt. This is

534
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.581
a principle of AI
