786
00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:30.615
you can see there's

787
00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:31.815
our output there. In

788
00:19:31.815 --> 00:19:33.095
our prompt, we requested

789
00:19:33.095 --> 00:19:33.953
a full report of

790
00:19:33.953 --> 00:19:34.993
the outputs, and that's

791
00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:35.893
exactly what we got

792
00:19:35.893 --> 00:19:36.872
here. The fact that

793
00:19:36.872 --> 00:19:38.412
Cloud Code runs in

794
00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:39.770
the terminal means we

795
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.690
can run it across

796
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:43.108
all developer environments, including

797
00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:45.508
full agentic environments where

798
00:19:45.508 --> 00:19:47.146
we're not even present.

799
00:19:47.146 --> 00:19:47.546
We're gonna be talking

800
00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.365
about agentic triggers in

801
00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:50.464
this course, but in

802
00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:51.703
addition to that, Cloud

803
00:19:51.703 --> 00:19:53.442
Code can be embedded

804
00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:54.981
inside of your code

805
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:56.901
base firing off when

806
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:57.601
it needs to doing

807
00:19:57.621 --> 00:19:58.361
the right thing at

808
00:19:58.361 --> 00:19:59.420
the right time. So

809
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.619
these files got created,
