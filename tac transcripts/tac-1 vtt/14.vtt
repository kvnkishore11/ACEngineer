249
00:06:57.495 --> 00:07:00.733
complete clarity. Stop coding.

250
00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:02.137
This is the not

251
00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:04.336
so controversial, controversial thing

252
00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:05.096
to say in the

253
00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:06.617
tech ecosystem, but you

254
00:07:06.617 --> 00:07:08.336
might understand this already.

255
00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.475
Most engineers AI coding

256
00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:12.995
have internalized this tactic

257
00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:14.396
at some level, but

258
00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:15.516
we have to take

259
00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:16.634
it all the way.

260
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:17.894
Let's end the debate

261
00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:19.774
right now. Your hands

262
00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:20.875
and your mind are

263
00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:22.495
no longer the best

264
00:07:22.514 --> 00:07:24.014
tool for the job

265
00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:25.894
of writing code full

266
00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:28.302
stop. Powerful language models

267
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.920
called the Agentic Loops
