230
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.331
a year into making

231
00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:33.031
this insane goal achievable

232
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:34.550
for you here across

233
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:36.009
eight lessons. If you

234
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:36.509
can put in the

235
00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.790
work to study each

236
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.958
tactic. If you like

237
00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:39.937
this plan, if you

238
00:06:39.937 --> 00:06:40.577
like where this is

239
00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:41.956
going, let's dive in

240
00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:43.317
to the first tactic

241
00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:44.797
that pulls your future

242
00:06:44.797 --> 00:06:46.956
abilities into the present.

243
00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:48.315
Brace yourself. The first

244
00:06:48.336 --> 00:06:49.815
tactic is dead simple,

245
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.156
is mission critical, and

246
00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:54.574
potentially uncomfortable. Stop coding.

247
00:06:56.194 --> 00:06:56.694
Let me say that

248
00:06:56.694 --> 00:06:57.495
one more time for

249
00:06:57.495 --> 00:07:00.733
complete clarity. Stop coding.
