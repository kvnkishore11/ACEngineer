765
00:18:58.807 --> 00:19:00.247
development lifecycle. This is

766
00:19:00.247 --> 00:19:03.006
a critical distinguishing feature

767
00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:04.560
from Cloud Code. We

768
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.060
need to be able

769
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.919
to embed our tooling

770
00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:09.097
across the terminal, across

771
00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:10.676
developer environments to drive

772
00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:12.974
real engineering outcomes with

773
00:19:13.154 --> 00:19:14.194
and without our oversight.

774
00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:14.913
I hope this is

775
00:19:14.913 --> 00:19:15.913
all adding up. I

776
00:19:15.913 --> 00:19:16.972
hope your engineering mind

777
00:19:16.972 --> 00:19:18.152
is starting to turn

778
00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:19.931
at how important this

779
00:19:19.931 --> 00:19:21.569
capability is. It's not

780
00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:22.909
just about the agentic

781
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:24.747
prompt. It's about where

782
00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:25.906
we can use the

783
00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:27.337
agentic prompt. and the

784
00:19:27.337 --> 00:19:28.336
fact that Cloud Code

785
00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:29.656
runs in the terminal,

786
00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:30.615
you can see there's
