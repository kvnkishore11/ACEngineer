310
00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:30.677
going to be sharp

311
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.815
sometimes, and I'm gonna

312
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:33.154
say things you might

313
00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:34.095
not wanna hear, but

314
00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:34.913
this is why you're

315
00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:35.793
here. It's up to

316
00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:37.652
you to accept, trust,

317
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:38.630
and bet on the

318
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.971
tactics we'll break down

319
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.548
lesson by lesson. Now,

320
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.808
this of course doesn't

321
00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:44.048
mean you don't generate

322
00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:45.447
code. After all, code

323
00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:45.927
is one of the

324
00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:47.804
primary assets that generates

325
00:08:47.804 --> 00:08:50.004
features, that generates products.

326
00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:51.363
Code understanding is still

327
00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:53.221
critically important. But we're

328
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:54.760
not coding anymore. To

329
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.240
scale into this new

330
00:08:56.418 --> 00:08:58.038
phase two role, we

331
00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.018
need to allocate our

332
00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:00.716
engineering cycles to planning,
