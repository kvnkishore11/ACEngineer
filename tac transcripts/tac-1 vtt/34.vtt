WEBVTT

673
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.480
now more capable than

674
00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.278
ever before. Now we

675
00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:03.158
have to make one

676
00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:04.298
more important call out

677
00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:06.598
about Claude Code. Not

678
00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:07.557
only can it run

679
00:17:07.817 --> 00:17:09.218
massive, and I mean

680
00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:11.681
massive, Agentic Coding prompts,

681
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.800
which we'll explore in

682
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.460
upcoming lessons. Claude Code is

683
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.798
also a programmable Agentic

684
00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.038
Coding tool. What does

685
00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:18.778
this mean? It means

686
00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:19.478
we can run it

687
00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:21.057
from any programming language

688
00:17:21.196 --> 00:17:22.736
that has terminal access.

689
00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:23.536
Go ahead, choose your

690
00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:24.994
favorite scripting language out

691
00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:26.255
of these three, shell,

692
00:17:26.273 --> 00:17:27.814
TypeScript with Bunn, or

693
00:17:27.814 --> 00:17:29.772
Python with Astral UV,

694
00:17:29.772 --> 00:17:31.192
and fire off Claude Code
