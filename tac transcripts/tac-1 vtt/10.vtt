173
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.410
first tactic soon. We'll

174
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.269
start agentic coding, but

175
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:03.161
We really need to

176
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.060
set expectations here and

177
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.500
we really need to

178
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.899
break down what it

179
00:05:06.918 --> 00:05:08.237
means to win. If

180
00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:09.276
we set the foundation

181
00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.716
right, everything else will

182
00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:12.295
fall into its place.

183
00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:14.112
In every software revolution,

184
00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:15.932
there's an opportunity for

185
00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:17.071
you to become the

186
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:19.788
fabled 10x engineer, not

187
00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:20.968
by spending 10x the

188
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.367
time or effort, but

189
00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:23.966
by achieving 10x the

190
00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:25.637
leverage this number is

191
00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:27.396
arbitrary it's 2x it's

192
00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:29.016
10x it's 100x it

193
00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:29.815
all depends on the

194
00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:31.235
leverage points you can
