596
00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.182
reason when needed, the

597
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.561
ability to consistently call

598
00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:04.278
long chains of tools

599
00:15:04.318 --> 00:15:05.518
and the right agent

600
00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:07.017
architecture. This is a

601
00:15:07.017 --> 00:15:09.336
differentiating factor of cloud

602
00:15:09.336 --> 00:15:10.933
code that will and

603
00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:12.432
is being copied by

604
00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:13.672
other tools. Why is

605
00:15:13.672 --> 00:15:14.792
that? It's because this

606
00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:16.769
capability unlocks the core

607
00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:18.149
four and the core

608
00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.767
four unlocks the Agentic

609
00:15:20.947 --> 00:15:23.570
Coding prompt. Now, these

610
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.208
are just known as

611
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:25.808
prompts. Okay, everyone knows

612
00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:26.668
these as just plain

613
00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:27.447
old prompts now that

614
00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:28.947
can call tools. People

615
00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:29.846
don't think about this.

616
00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.385
People don't really invest
