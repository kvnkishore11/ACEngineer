00:20:29.249 --> 00:20:30.367
AI coding and agentic

830
00:20:30.367 --> 00:20:32.167
coding will ripple throughout

831
00:20:32.347 --> 00:20:34.007
every lesson moving forward.

832
00:20:34.227 --> 00:20:35.987
Agentic coding is not

833
00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.526
about us writing code.

834
00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:39.346
It's about building systems

835
00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:41.204
that build systems on

836
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.545
our behalf. The contradicting

837
00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:44.604
truth about what you'll

838
00:20:44.624 --> 00:20:46.263
learn in tactical agentic

839
00:20:46.263 --> 00:20:47.682
coding is this. To

840
00:20:47.682 --> 00:20:50.083
become an irreplaceable engineer,

841
00:20:50.303 --> 00:20:52.541
you will replace yourself.

842
00:20:53.026 --> 00:20:54.285
You won't see any

843
00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:56.184
vibe coders replicating what

844
00:20:56.184 --> 00:20:57.104
you'll be able to

845
00:20:57.104 --> 00:20:58.604
do when you finish

846
00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:01.143
tactical agentic coding. Evolution
