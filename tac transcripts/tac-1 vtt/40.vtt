809
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.619
these files got created,

810
00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:01.659
all of this work

811
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.598
ran. Here's the prompt.

812
00:20:03.878 --> 00:20:05.038
You have access to

813
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.357
all of this. This

814
00:20:06.377 --> 00:20:07.936
single code base, this

815
00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:09.556
hyper simple code base

816
00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:11.474
sets up and frames

817
00:20:11.494 --> 00:20:12.315
everything we're going to

818
00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:14.054
do in tactical agentic

819
00:20:14.054 --> 00:20:14.653
coding. We're going to

820
00:20:14.653 --> 00:20:16.353
take this idea of

821
00:20:16.353 --> 00:20:17.712
the agentic prompt and

822
00:20:17.712 --> 00:20:18.751
we're going to scale

823
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:20.172
it to the max.

824
00:20:21.671 --> 00:20:22.931
Great work here. This

825
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.230
was a dense lesson

826
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.730
one. But this essential

827
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.848
tactic, stop coding, and

828
00:20:27.848 --> 00:20:29.249
the key difference between

829
00:20:29.249 --> 00:20:30.367
AI coding and agentic
