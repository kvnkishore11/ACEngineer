00:09:57.989 --> 00:10:00.827
type Claude. Throughout Tactical

375
00:10:00.827 --> 00:10:02.567
Agentic Coding, Claude Code

376
00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:03.788
will be our primary

377
00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:05.168
Agentic Coding tool. We're

378
00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:06.067
going to be using

379
00:10:06.447 --> 00:10:07.927
millions and millions of

380
00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:09.006
tokens. So make sure

381
00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.086
you have the funds

382
00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:11.126
or the Claude plan

383
00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:12.126
to support it. We're

384
00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:14.206
going for maximum return

385
00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:15.405
on investment in order

386
00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:16.125
to tap into these

387
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:17.597
capabilities We have to

388
00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:19.056
pay to play. Now,

389
00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:20.474
just as ADER was

390
00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:21.533
for the AI coding

391
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:23.032
phase one era, Claude

392
00:10:23.032 --> 00:10:24.529
Code represents the best

393
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.927
phase two Agentic Coding

394
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:28.826
tool to teach execute

395
00:10:28.826 --> 00:10:29.945
and tap into the

396
00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:31.644
next generation of engineering.
