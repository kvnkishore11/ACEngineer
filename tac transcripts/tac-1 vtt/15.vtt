268
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.800
running on powerful supercomputers

269
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.360
are now vastly superior

270
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.759
coders than you and

271
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.838
I are. Don't be

272
00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:38.278
the engineer that can't

273
00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:39.237
let go of the

274
00:07:39.237 --> 00:07:40.997
past. So stop coding

275
00:07:40.997 --> 00:07:42.456
and use the best

276
00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:43.697
tool for the job.

277
00:07:43.836 --> 00:07:44.757
Trust me, I miss

278
00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:45.836
coding too. I've spent

279
00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.196
over a decade working

280
00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:49.074
at startups, large companies,

281
00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:50.134
typing code by hand,

282
00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:51.675
honing my craft, mastering

283
00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:54.473
languages, understanding syntax, algorithms,

284
00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:55.733
data structures, doing it

285
00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:56.872
all by hand. But

286
00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:58.670
remember, you're an engineer,

287
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.771
not a coder. The

288
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.949
difference is massive. Throughout
