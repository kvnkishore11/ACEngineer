746
00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:30.394
tools. This is super,

747
00:18:30.394 --> 00:18:31.574
super critical, right? We

748
00:18:31.574 --> 00:18:33.753
need this capability of

749
00:18:33.753 --> 00:18:36.012
having a programmable agentic

750
00:18:36.053 --> 00:18:37.192
coding tool. Why is

751
00:18:37.192 --> 00:18:38.232
that? It's because we

752
00:18:38.232 --> 00:18:39.751
wanna be building systems

753
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.432
that build systems for

754
00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:42.891
us. And with this,

755
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:43.391
you can see these

756
00:18:43.391 --> 00:18:44.351
files are getting created,

757
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.030
our branch just changed.

758
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.309
With this capability, with

759
00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:50.049
the agentic coding tool

760
00:18:50.049 --> 00:18:51.229
that we can program,

761
00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:53.048
we can embed our

762
00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:54.147
own agents, our own

763
00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:56.008
workflows, our own agentic

764
00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:58.807
prompts across the software

765
00:18:58.807 --> 00:19:00.247
development lifecycle. This is
