00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:30.435
when you finish this

152
00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:31.475
course and when you

153
00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:32.754
do your part and

154
00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:33.754
put these tactics to

155
00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:35.413
work, you'll become an

156
00:04:35.473 --> 00:04:38.432
irreplaceable engineer. Only ambitious

157
00:04:38.432 --> 00:04:39.773
goals are worth having.

158
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.192
I built this course

159
00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.413
with this goal so

160
00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:43.492
that even if you

161
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.791
or I fall short,

162
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:46.112
you'll still land on

163
00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:47.432
Mars or the moon

164
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.831
far ahead of the

165
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.711
rest. I want to

166
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:51.711
be absolutely clear. What

167
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:52.690
does it mean to

168
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.471
be an irreplaceable engineer

169
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.031
in phase two with

170
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:57.271
agentic coding as your

171
00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:58.930
new tool of engineering?

172
00:04:58.949 --> 00:04:59.410
We'll get to the

173
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.410
first tactic soon. We'll
