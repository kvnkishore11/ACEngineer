396
00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:31.644
next generation of engineering.

397
00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:32.942
As we progress through

398
00:10:32.942 --> 00:10:34.581
each lesson, you'll understand

399
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:35.682
exactly what I mean.

400
00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:37.380
So your Claude Code UI

401
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.519
might look different. You

402
00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.580
might be using newer

403
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.058
models. That's all great.

404
00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:42.357
That's fantastic. We know

405
00:10:42.357 --> 00:10:43.557
that tools will change

406
00:10:43.557 --> 00:10:44.897
and models will improve.

407
00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:45.735
Don't let that distract

408
00:10:45.735 --> 00:10:46.895
you from the value

409
00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:48.134
embedded in each lesson

410
00:10:48.134 --> 00:10:49.293
here. Claude Code is our

411
00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:50.653
primary agentic coding tool

412
00:10:50.653 --> 00:10:52.092
for many reasons we'll

413
00:10:52.092 --> 00:10:53.772
explore throughout the course.

414
00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:54.691
But keep in mind,

415
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.149
these tactics are transferable.

416
00:10:57.346 --> 00:10:58.505
to the right Agentic

417
00:10:58.505 --> 00:10:59.684
Coding tools that have
