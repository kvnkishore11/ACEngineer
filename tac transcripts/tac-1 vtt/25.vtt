489
00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:30.956
been running Agentic Coding

490
00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:32.674
prompts, which are prompts

491
00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:34.173
that can call tools.

492
00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:35.734
Big whoop, who cares?

493
00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:37.153
Let's slow down here

494
00:12:37.153 --> 00:12:38.513
because the difference between

495
00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:39.592
these two prompts is

496
00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.511
monumental. It's absolutely massive.

497
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:42.511
Okay, let's set up

498
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:43.791
the groundwork that we're

499
00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:45.171
going to walk, run,

500
00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:46.671
and then blast off

501
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.210
from. Claude Code is

502
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.230
not just writing code.

503
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.208
It's calling tools. It's

504
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:54.048
doing engineering work. You

505
00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:54.908
can see here, we

506
00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:55.687
checked out a brand

507
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:56.388
new branch. You can

508
00:12:56.388 --> 00:12:57.048
see we're on this

509
00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:58.547
demo Agentic Coding branch

510
00:12:58.547 --> 00:12:59.486
now. We wrote this

511
00:12:59.486 --> 00:13:00.866
new main tack file.
