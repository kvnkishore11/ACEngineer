00:05:59.468 --> 00:06:01.026
become is the engineer

214
00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.946
that transforms their code

215
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.144
bases into self-operating machines.

216
00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:07.244
This course teaches you

217
00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:08.562
the tactics of agentic

218
00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:10.362
coding to maximize your

219
00:06:10.362 --> 00:06:12.374
leverage so much so

220
00:06:12.374 --> 00:06:13.814
that your code base

221
00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.612
literally runs itself. You'll

222
00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:17.353
learn how to invest

223
00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:18.372
your time in the

224
00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:20.572
right places and repeatedly

225
00:06:20.572 --> 00:06:23.031
extract value by using

226
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.012
the right compute across

227
00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:26.732
your tools, products, and

228
00:06:26.732 --> 00:06:28.031
codebases. This is

229
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:29.850
ambitious. I've poured over

230
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.331
a year into making
