534
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.581
a principle of AI

535
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:32.080
coding. It's always there

536
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.879
even if you can't

537
00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.298
see it. Agentic Coding

538
00:13:34.457 --> 00:13:35.777
is a superset of

539
00:13:35.817 --> 00:13:37.296
AI coding. Agentic Coding

540
00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:38.754
expands on the big

541
00:13:38.754 --> 00:13:40.673
three by adding one

542
00:13:40.894 --> 00:13:42.692
new dimension. You already

543
00:13:42.692 --> 00:13:43.251
know what this new

544
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:44.412
dimension is. It's been

545
00:13:44.412 --> 00:13:45.811
hiding in plain sight

546
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:47.029
and becoming more and

547
00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:48.448
more capable over time.

548
00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:49.648
The new element that

549
00:13:49.668 --> 00:13:51.846
transforms the big three

550
00:13:51.846 --> 00:13:53.121
of AI coding to

551
00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:54.600
Agentic Coding is

552
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.739
prompts that can reliably

553
00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:58.898
execute long chains of

554
00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.037
tools. When you add
