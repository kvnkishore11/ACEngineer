554
00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.037
tools. When you add

555
00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:01.556
tools, we upgrade the

556
00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:02.913
big three to the

557
00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:05.044
core Now, I know

558
00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.044
what you're thinking. Tool

559
00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:07.144
calling has been around

560
00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:07.962
for a while. This

561
00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:09.543
is not new. Nearly

562
00:14:09.602 --> 00:14:11.581
every modern AI application

563
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:12.740
is connected to some

564
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.820
type of tool now

565
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.840
where we can do

566
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.219
web searches, run Git

567
00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:17.998
commands, and arbitrary tool

568
00:14:17.998 --> 00:14:19.557
calls via the model

569
00:14:19.557 --> 00:14:21.914
context protocol. You're 100%

570
00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:22.894
right about that. But

571
00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:24.153
that's not the only

572
00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:25.793
new primitive of agentic

573
00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:26.913
coding. And it's not

574
00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:28.052
a question of new.

575
00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:29.091
It's a question of

576
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:31.470
scale and performance. So
