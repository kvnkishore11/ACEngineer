653
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.440
TAC is built upon

654
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.159
this core idea you

655
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:33.440
can see right in

656
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.860
this readme with just

657
00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:37.259
35 lines. Okay. Everything

658
00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.099
is about this difference,

659
00:16:39.158 --> 00:16:40.219
right? It's about this

660
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:41.778
capability here, the Agentic

661
00:16:41.778 --> 00:16:42.719
Coding prompt. We can

662
00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:43.597
also just shorten this

663
00:16:43.597 --> 00:16:44.957
to just be the

664
00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:46.878
Agentic prompt. A prompt

665
00:16:47.142 --> 00:16:48.682
contains a sequence of

666
00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:50.421
tool calls. Again, these

667
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:50.941
are just known as

668
00:16:50.941 --> 00:16:52.341
prompts, but it's important

669
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.740
to distinguish these because

670
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.061
with the right context,

671
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.659
model, prompt, and now

672
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.860
tools, these prompts are

673
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.480
now more capable than
