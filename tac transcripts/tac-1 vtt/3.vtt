44
00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:30.865
the birth of VibeCoders

45
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.521
and the complete commoditization

46
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:34.680
of code. We learn

47
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.099
the principles of AI

48
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.299
coding and use the

49
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.959
big three context model

50
00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.337
prompt to build faster

51
00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:44.076
than ever. Agentic coding

52
00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:47.275
marks phase two. This

53
00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:48.594
is where real engineers

54
00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.674
strike back. They uplevel

55
00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:52.254
once again and turn

56
00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:53.673
their codebases into

57
00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:57.272
increasingly self-operating machines. We

58
00:01:57.272 --> 00:01:58.710
have one mission in

59
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.998
Tactical Agentic Coding. Transform
