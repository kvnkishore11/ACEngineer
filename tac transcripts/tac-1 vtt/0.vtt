00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:01.239
Here's what most engineers

2
00:00:01.298 --> 00:00:03.301
miss. AI coding was

3
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.301
just the beginning. Vibe

4
00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:06.562
coding is the lowest

5
00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:09.666
hanging fruit. 95% of

6
00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:10.867
all codebases are

7
00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:13.169
now outdated and inefficient.

8
00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.791
You, the engineer, are

9
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.192
the bottleneck, not the

10
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:18.812
models, not the tools,

11
00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:20.835
not the agents. And

12
00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.016
most importantly, right now,

13
00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:24.358
in this exact moment,

14
00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:26.359
a single AI agent

15
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.821
is doing someone's job

16
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:29.341
better than they can.
