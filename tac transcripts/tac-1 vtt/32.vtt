635
00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.597
with and without your

636
00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:02.317
oversight. What we'll explore

637
00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:03.517
throughout this course is

638
00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:05.615
the scale of engineering

639
00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:06.674
work that you can

640
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.553
accomplish with the Agentic

641
00:16:08.754 --> 00:16:11.013
Coding prompt firing off

642
00:16:11.192 --> 00:16:12.413
in the right Agentic

643
00:16:12.413 --> 00:16:14.211
Coding tool over and

644
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.890
over and over with

645
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.150
the right triggers, with

646
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.110
the right leverage at

647
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.162
the right time in

648
00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:22.501
a highly performant, self-validating

649
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.541
fashion. Reliable Agentic Coding

650
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.441
at scale was not

651
00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:28.181
possible before Claude Code.

652
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.061
Everything we do in

653
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.440
TAC is built upon
