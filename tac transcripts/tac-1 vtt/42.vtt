00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:01.143
tactical agentic coding. Evolution

847
00:21:01.143 --> 00:21:02.481
is hard. It's challenging.

848
00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:03.162
We're going to push

849
00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:04.662
through hard concepts. On

850
00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:06.760
lesson one, I've already

851
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.619
requested that you stop

852
00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:09.960
coding, right? We're using

853
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.818
the best tool for

854
00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:12.578
the job. Evolution forces

855
00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:13.718
us to leave skills

856
00:21:13.718 --> 00:21:15.349
behind to adapt new

857
00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:16.709
ones and bet on

858
00:21:16.769 --> 00:21:18.528
potential futures. But in

859
00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.028
the tech industry, this

860
00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:20.928
is where all the

861
00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:22.386
alpha lies. This is

862
00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:24.346
where your asymmetric engineering

863
00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:26.445
advantage exists. It's in

864
00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:27.704
the future. It's in

865
00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:29.865
pushing what's possible forward.

866
00:21:29.904 --> 00:21:31.384
Let's start scaling the
