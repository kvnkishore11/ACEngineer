288
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.949
difference is massive. Throughout

289
00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:03.827
TAC, Tactical Agentic Coding,

290
00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:04.567
we're not going to

291
00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.447
type a single line

292
00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:07.865
of code. I need

293
00:08:07.865 --> 00:08:08.985
you on board with

294
00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:10.704
this uncomfortable tactic. This

295
00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:11.884
is the first and

296
00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:13.882
most foundational tactic. Imagine

297
00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:15.862
eight tactics stacked up

298
00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:16.461
on each other. We're

299
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.221
gonna break through them

300
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:18.459
one by one. Some

301
00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:19.639
are required. Some will

302
00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.399
accelerate your capabilities. If

303
00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.718
you're still typing code,

304
00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:24.321
you have no chance

305
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.180
of keeping up. I'm

306
00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.579
gonna say exactly what

307
00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:27.379
I need to say

308
00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:28.237
in this course to

309
00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:29.937
transform your engineering. It's

310
00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:30.677
going to be sharp
