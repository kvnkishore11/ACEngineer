418
00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:01.965
the right capabilities. Don't

419
00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:03.225
get stuck on any

420
00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:04.224
one tool. In this

421
00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:04.823
codebase, you'll see

422
00:11:04.823 --> 00:11:05.903
one file and two

423
00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:08.024
directories. Inside of .claude,

424
00:11:08.144 --> 00:11:09.503
we have our permissions

425
00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:10.702
for Claude Code. I

426
00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:11.883
highly recommend you always

427
00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:12.663
check out the settings

428
00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:13.442
so you know what

429
00:11:13.442 --> 00:11:14.721
Claude Code has access

430
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:15.642
to. We have a

431
00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.421
programmable directory we're gonna

432
00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:18.421
discuss in a moment.

433
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.181
Let's go ahead and

434
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:20.320
open up the readme

435
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.580
and let's run an

436
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.879
AI coding prompt and

437
00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.899
then an agentic coding

438
00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:26.038
prompt to really understand

439
00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.738
what's different between AI

440
00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:29.496
coding and agentic coding.

441
00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:30.216
So let's open up
