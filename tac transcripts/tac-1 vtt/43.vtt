866
00:21:29.904 --> 00:21:31.384
Let's start scaling the

867
00:21:31.384 --> 00:21:33.003
core for the Identic

868
00:21:33.003 --> 00:21:34.583
Prompt and Cloud Code

869
00:21:34.603 --> 00:21:36.461
into real engineering work

870
00:21:36.741 --> 00:21:38.422
across worlds. the software

871
00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.121
development lifecycle. Next up,

872
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.440
we'll explore the most

873
00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:43.358
important leverage points of

874
00:21:43.398 --> 00:21:44.597
agentic coding so that

875
00:21:44.617 --> 00:21:45.396
10 minutes of your

876
00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:46.696
work is equivalent to

877
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:48.435
60 minutes or more

878
00:21:48.435 --> 00:21:49.815
of another engineer's work.

879
00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:51.453
Great job here. I'll

880
00:21:51.453 --> 00:21:52.073
see you in lesson

881
00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:52.553
two.
