10
00:00:29.257 --> 00:00:31.435
you've realized something critical.

11
00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.213
AI coding is not

12
00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:35.231
enough. Engineering is about

13
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:37.131
much more than just

14
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:38.686
writing code. In your

15
00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:39.965
first lesson, we're going

16
00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.005
to set the stage

17
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:42.304
and discuss the one

18
00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:43.723
idea you need to

19
00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:45.944
transform from a phase

20
00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:48.103
one AI coding engineer

21
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:50.002
into an entirely new

22
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.061
role of engineering. If

23
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:53.600
you understand the concepts

24
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.981
in this lesson, you're

25
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.180
setting yourself up to

26
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.380
maximize the value of

27
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.478
TAC, Tactical Agentic Coding.
