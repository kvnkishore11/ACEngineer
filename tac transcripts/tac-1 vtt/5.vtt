79
00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:30.527
your little brother can

80
00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:31.646
build an app with

81
00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:33.545
one prompt? The answer

82
00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:34.545
is simple. We do

83
00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:35.745
what we always do

84
00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:37.905
in technological revolutions. We

85
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:39.264
move up the stack

86
00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:40.742
once again. We become

87
00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:42.402
a commander of compute

88
00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:43.461
and you don't just

89
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:45.281
prompt to generate code.

90
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.379
That's phase one engineering.

91
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.219
AI coding is not

92
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.979
enough. You know this.

93
00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.078
You take this compute

94
00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:53.117
and you use it

95
00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.186
to build systems that

96
00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:57.504
build systems. Once you

97
00:02:57.504 --> 00:02:58.145
learn how to do

98
00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.625
this, you will become

99
00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:02.224
a phase two Agentic
