332
00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:00.716
engineering cycles to planning,

333
00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:02.955
reviewing, and creating closed

334
00:09:03.054 --> 00:09:04.952
loop structures. More on

335
00:09:04.952 --> 00:09:06.052
that in upcoming lessons.

336
00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:07.192
So it's important to

337
00:09:07.192 --> 00:09:08.811
discuss what's enabled all

338
00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:10.330
this. What exactly has

339
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.048
changed in the transition

340
00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:13.746
from AI coding to

341
00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:15.066
Agentic Coding? Let's keep

342
00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:16.684
it simple and focus

343
00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:18.244
on the primitives of

344
00:09:18.244 --> 00:09:20.363
Agentic Coding that changes

345
00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:22.077
everything. To understand these

346
00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:23.957
primitives, let's first get

347
00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:25.076
set up with the

348
00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:27.116
essential tools for tactical

349
00:09:27.157 --> 00:09:28.917
Agentic Coding. I'll list

350
00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:29.636
them on the screen

351
00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.657
right now. If you're
