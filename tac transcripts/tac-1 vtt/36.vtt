721
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:00.166
git branch we can

722
00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:01.105
see that branch that

723
00:18:01.105 --> 00:18:01.986
was generated by the

724
00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:03.066
initial run i'm just

725
00:18:03.066 --> 00:18:04.405
going to get branch

726
00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:05.566
delete this and then

727
00:18:05.566 --> 00:18:06.226
i'm going to run

728
00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:07.506
the python version of

729
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:08.417
this I'm gonna go

730
00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:09.038
ahead and kick this

731
00:18:09.038 --> 00:18:09.917
off and it's going

732
00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:10.897
to rerun that workflow.

733
00:18:10.897 --> 00:18:11.656
Here's the prompt it's

734
00:18:11.656 --> 00:18:13.576
running. And here is

735
00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:15.416
programmable.python. So you can

736
00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:16.356
see this exactly what's

737
00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:17.436
running. If we open

738
00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:19.615
up.py, you can see

739
00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:20.615
exactly what this looks

740
00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:21.576
like. This is a

741
00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:22.915
key element, is a

742
00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:24.795
key advantage of Claude

743
00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:26.154
code that once again,

744
00:18:26.154 --> 00:18:27.894
differentiates it from all

745
00:18:27.894 --> 00:18:29.035
the other agentic coding

746
00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:30.394
tools. This is super,
