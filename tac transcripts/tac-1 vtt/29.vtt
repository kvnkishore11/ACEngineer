576
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:31.470
scale and performance. So

577
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.649
what's the difference here?

578
00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:33.268
Why is this so

579
00:14:33.268 --> 00:14:34.207
important? Why am I

580
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.105
differentiating between the AI

581
00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:37.205
coding prompt and the

582
00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:38.423
Agentic Coding prompt? The

583
00:14:38.423 --> 00:14:39.763
big difference here is

584
00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.042
that tools have changed

585
00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:42.960
and models have improved.

586
00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:43.958
We need to take

587
00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.118
into account a new

588
00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.057
form factor of engineering.

589
00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:47.735
We need to take

590
00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:50.073
into account Claude Code.

591
00:14:50.234 --> 00:14:51.092
Claude Code is the

592
00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:53.250
first Agentic Coding tool

593
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.725
to properly combine three

594
00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:57.504
essential elements, a powerful

595
00:14:57.524 --> 00:14:58.563
language model that can

596
00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.182
reason when needed, the
