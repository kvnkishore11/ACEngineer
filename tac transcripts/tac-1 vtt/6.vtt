00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:02.224
a phase two Agentic

100
00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:04.783
Engineer. Engineering was never

101
00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:06.223
about writing code. It's

102
00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:07.723
about building systems of

103
00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:10.383
leverage that produce valuable

104
00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:12.263
outcomes for your users

105
00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.163
and your customers. Great.

106
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:15.562
So we understand the

107
00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.342
mission and the strategy

108
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.622
of Tactical Agentic Coding,

109
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.098
become an irreplaceable engineer.

110
00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.117
But how does this

111
00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:24.377
course help you get

112
00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:26.195
there? Throughout eight lessons,

113
00:03:26.294 --> 00:03:27.394
we'll break down eight

114
00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:29.891
tactics of Agentic Coding.

115
00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:31.270
As you progress through
