00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.385
People don't really invest

617
00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:32.485
the time to understand

618
00:15:32.485 --> 00:15:33.764
what this means. But

619
00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:35.144
don't turn your brain

620
00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:36.543
off in thinking you

621
00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:38.342
understand the scale in

622
00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:39.682
which the core four

623
00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:41.162
and the Agentic prompt

624
00:15:41.162 --> 00:15:43.880
changes engineering work forever.

625
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.740
When you take the

626
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.240
core four and wrap

627
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.519
it in an Agentic

628
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:48.839
Coding tool like Claude

629
00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:50.398
Code, you can create

630
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:51.341
As you'll see in

631
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.140
this course, long running

632
00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:55.159
end to end AI

633
00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:57.139
developer workflows that run

634
00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:59.097
for minutes to hours

635
00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.597
