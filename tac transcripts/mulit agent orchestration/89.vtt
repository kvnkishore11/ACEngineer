1949
00:44:29.507 --> 00:44:31.268
superior to agent handoffs.

1950
00:44:31.467 --> 00:44:32.367
It's more superior to

1951
00:44:32.947 --> 00:44:34.409
a blind sub agents.

1952
00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:35.628
We have a primary

1953
00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:36.849
agent here that has

1954
00:44:36.869 --> 00:44:38.309
been given context. It

1955
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:40.030
can reference other files.

1956
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:41.949
It is less ephemeral.

1957
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.170
We can reprompt. We

1958
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.710
can run continuation prompts

1959
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.271
through our orchestrator agent,

1960
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:46.771
so on and so

1961
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:47.610
forth. Right? So let's

1962
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:47.992
just go ahead and

1963
00:44:48.012 --> 00:44:49.032
finish up checking out

1964
00:44:49.052 --> 00:44:49.791
this prompt, right? So

1965
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:50.813
we have, our build

1966
00:44:50.992 --> 00:44:51.632
and then we have

1967
00:44:51.793 --> 00:44:52.815
our final, right? But

1968
00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:53.275
if we just scroll

1969
00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:53.835
back up to the

1970
00:44:53.876 --> 00:44:54.936
top here, right? We

1971
00:44:55.016 --> 00:44:56.978
are running an orchestration

1972
00:44:57.059 --> 00:44:58.440
prompt. So our high

1973
00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.842
level agent is kicking

1974
00:44:59.902 --> 00:45:01.184
off three agents and
