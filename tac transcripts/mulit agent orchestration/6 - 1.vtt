108
00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:00.055
about what you can

109
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.389
do anymore it's about

110
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.251
where you can teach

111
00:03:02.512 --> 00:03:03.592
your agents to do

112
00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:05.556
for you there's one

113
00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:08.260
more level one giant

114
00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:09.622
leap forward I'm going

115
00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:10.304
to share with you

116
00:03:10.604 --> 00:03:12.481
in this lesson Engineers

117
00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:13.402
like you and I

118
00:03:13.683 --> 00:03:15.284
using agents every single

119
00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.885
day, we're all thinking

120
00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:18.167
about the same thing

121
00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:19.367
and the votes for

122
00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:21.150
agentic horizon show it.

123
00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.531
In order to scale

124
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:23.951
your agents, you need

125
00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:25.713
to manage your fleets

126
00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:28.855
of agents. Multi-agent orchestration

127
00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.477
is the next step
