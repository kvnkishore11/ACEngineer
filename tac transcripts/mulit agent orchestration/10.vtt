WEBVTT

176
00:04:59.673 --> 00:05:01.194
interface. It has useful

177
00:05:01.254 --> 00:05:03.117
metadata about the capabilities

178
00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:04.276
of this codebase

179
00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:04.997
we'll cover in a

180
00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:06.019
moment. We'll just start

181
00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.379
with a simple ping

182
00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.201
prompt. Our orchestrator agent

183
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.041
is going to of

184
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:10.762
course give us a

185
00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:12.644
quick response. Now let's

186
00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:14.245
spin up some agents.

187
00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:15.687
Here we're gonna create

188
00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:17.810
three individual agents. We're

189
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.769
gonna have them summarize

190
00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:19.730
the codebase, build

191
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:21.392
an application structure summary

192
00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:22.593
inside of a markdown

193
00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:24.797
file with mermaid tables.

194
00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:25.798
We're gonna fire this

195
00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:27.478
off and truly show

196
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:28.740
off the potential and

197
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.122
the capability of an
