2191
00:49:29.641 --> 00:49:30.461
be a great direction

2192
00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:31.222
to go. I should

2193
00:49:31.242 --> 00:49:31.782
be able to just

2194
00:49:31.842 --> 00:49:33.121
quickly start a new

2195
00:49:33.242 --> 00:49:34.742
agent or reference previous

2196
00:49:34.882 --> 00:49:36.623
orchestration agents and their

2197
00:49:36.722 --> 00:49:38.302
related agents so that

2198
00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.322
we can work on

2199
00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:40.784
multiple systems, multiple code

2200
00:49:40.824 --> 00:49:42.605
bases throughout single interface

2201
00:49:42.784 --> 00:49:43.847
with a single UI.

2202
00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.188
Right now, if we

2203
00:49:45.268 --> 00:49:46.630
hop into the code

2204
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.911
here, this server is

2205
00:49:47.972 --> 00:49:49.454
actually pointed toward one

2206
00:49:49.554 --> 00:49:50.976
specific codebase at

2207
00:49:50.996 --> 00:49:51.998
a time. I think

2208
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.550
This is a great

2209
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.391
place to start, but

2210
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:54.331
we can push this

2211
00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.333
further. Something else that's

2212
00:49:55.373 --> 00:49:56.393
missing. If we want

2213
00:49:56.454 --> 00:49:57.974
to fork an agent's

2214
00:49:58.034 --> 00:49:59.777
context window and basically
