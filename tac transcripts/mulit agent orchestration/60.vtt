1292
00:29:58.422 --> 00:30:00.061
all here. This is

1293
00:30:00.266 --> 00:30:01.587
the next level of

1294
00:30:01.647 --> 00:30:03.250
agentic engineering. We start

1295
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:04.230
at base, we add

1296
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.432
better, we add more,

1297
00:30:05.573 --> 00:30:07.095
we customize them, and

1298
00:30:07.134 --> 00:30:08.817
then we orchestrate all

1299
00:30:08.876 --> 00:30:09.518
of them. Okay, I

1300
00:30:09.518 --> 00:30:10.680
don't care what user

1301
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.961
interface you use. Of

1302
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.642
course, I'm gonna make

1303
00:30:12.642 --> 00:30:13.583
this available to you,

1304
00:30:14.023 --> 00:30:15.465
but the idea is

1305
00:30:15.546 --> 00:30:16.727
the same. We need

1306
00:30:16.807 --> 00:30:18.769
multi-agent orchestration, and the

1307
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.551
orchestrator agent is one

1308
00:30:20.692 --> 00:30:21.313
way for you to

1309
00:30:21.373 --> 00:30:22.875
accomplish that task, all

1310
00:30:22.895 --> 00:30:23.516
right? There is a

1311
00:30:23.516 --> 00:30:24.798
feeling you're gonna get

1312
00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:25.738
once you get this

1313
00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:26.558
up and running, once

1314
00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:27.440
you start using this,

1315
00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:29.560
that is differentiated. I've

1316
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.201
come back to this
