392
00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:00.990
opportunity to actually talk

393
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.149
about the codebase

394
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.611
architecture. And to be

395
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:05.253
completely clear here, our

396
00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:07.094
multi-agent application here, our

397
00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:08.355
agents, our Oracle Shure

398
00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:09.796
agent, this codebase

399
00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:11.477
is pointed back at

400
00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.010
itself. Okay, so the

401
00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:15.475
working directory is the

402
00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:17.216
multi-agent orchestration system, right?

403
00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:17.977
We are using the

404
00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.659
system to build the

405
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.001
system quite literally. Let's

406
00:10:21.022 --> 00:10:22.124
go ahead and understand

407
00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:23.666
what this is and

408
00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:24.888
how this looks, okay?

409
00:10:25.227 --> 00:10:25.528
So you can see

410
00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:27.191
here, four key components.

411
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.991
And we asked for

412
00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:30.154
concrete mermaid diagrams. We
