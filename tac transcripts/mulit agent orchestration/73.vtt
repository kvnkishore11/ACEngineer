1572
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.572
agents operating the actual

1573
00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:31.873
work. Now our orchestrator

1574
00:36:31.934 --> 00:36:32.934
has handed the work

1575
00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:34.217
off to our builder

1576
00:36:34.378 --> 00:36:36.179
agent. Okay, very powerful

1577
00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:37.041
stuff there. There's another

1578
00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:38.543
command agent tool and

1579
00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.324
you can see, check

1580
00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:40.286
out this write up.

1581
00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:42.110
check out this detailed

1582
00:36:42.172 --> 00:36:43.592
write up our orchestrator

1583
00:36:43.793 --> 00:36:45.034
gave to our builder.

1584
00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:46.275
Okay. It is doing

1585
00:36:46.315 --> 00:36:47.677
some serious prompt engineering.

1586
00:36:47.817 --> 00:36:48.157
You can see the

1587
00:36:48.197 --> 00:36:49.157
work coming in there.

1588
00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:50.199
Keep in mind, these

1589
00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:51.960
agents are operating on

1590
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.742
this project. They're operating

1591
00:36:53.882 --> 00:36:55.463
on themselves. Builder being

1592
00:36:55.503 --> 00:36:56.744
very precise because we

1593
00:36:56.784 --> 00:36:58.206
had a scouter look

1594
00:36:58.246 --> 00:36:58.907
for the changes to

1595
00:36:58.947 --> 00:37:00.768
make. Obviously relatively simple
