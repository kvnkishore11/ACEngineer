00:39:58.552 --> 00:40:00.255
AI developer workflows and

1730
00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:01.556
your agentic layer, all

1731
00:40:01.556 --> 00:40:02.556
right? The big advantage

1732
00:40:02.597 --> 00:40:03.356
here with the O

1733
00:40:03.556 --> 00:40:04.498
agent is that you

1734
00:40:04.518 --> 00:40:05.619
can use this long

1735
00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:06.539
before you have an

1736
00:40:06.579 --> 00:40:07.440
agentic layer, which is

1737
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:08.501
really important when you're

1738
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:10.143
first using this pattern,

1739
00:40:10.163 --> 00:40:10.893
when you're first using

1740
00:40:10.893 --> 00:40:12.244
these ideas. Okay. So

1741
00:40:12.864 --> 00:40:13.824
there's a summary, right?

1742
00:40:13.965 --> 00:40:15.286
Our orchestrator agent just

1743
00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:16.626
continued in that agentic

1744
00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:18.226
loop, checking the progress.

1745
00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:19.347
We have a live

1746
00:40:19.487 --> 00:40:20.588
feed going into our

1747
00:40:20.608 --> 00:40:21.467
database. We can just

1748
00:40:21.547 --> 00:40:22.668
tap into with a

1749
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:24.289
custom tool that our

1750
00:40:24.409 --> 00:40:25.690
orchestrator agent can use.

1751
00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:26.789
And here we have

1752
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.050
concrete results. We can

1753
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:28.751
of course blow this

1754
00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:29.210
up a little bit

1755
00:40:29.251 --> 00:40:29.811
to see this a

1756
00:40:29.811 --> 00:40:30.791
little better. Obviously the
