1624
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.391
what we really care

1625
00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:31.391
about most of all

1626
00:37:31.672 --> 00:37:33.152
is the results. Our

1627
00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:34.353
orchestrator thinking one more

1628
00:37:34.373 --> 00:37:36.135
time, still executing, doing

1629
00:37:36.175 --> 00:37:37.775
verification work, looks great.

1630
00:37:37.916 --> 00:37:38.836
Changes are in place.

1631
00:37:38.996 --> 00:37:39.818
It's gonna check the

1632
00:37:39.898 --> 00:37:41.277
syntax for us. All

1633
00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:42.298
this is happening for

1634
00:37:42.378 --> 00:37:44.300
us with our multi-agent

1635
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.461
orchestration system, all driven

1636
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.809
by our orchestration agent.

1637
00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:48.630
We have put together

1638
00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:50.751
three critical pieces to

1639
00:37:50.831 --> 00:37:52.391
unlock the next scale

1640
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:54.010
of agentic engineering. We

1641
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:55.351
have an orchestrator, we

1642
00:37:55.431 --> 00:37:57.391
have CRUD for agents,

1643
00:37:57.411 --> 00:37:57.952
so we can unlock

1644
00:37:58.112 --> 00:37:59.371
agents at scale, and

1645
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.293
we have observability. These
