127
00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.477
is the next step

128
00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:31.658
in our journey as

129
00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:33.860
agentic engineers. So let

130
00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.001
me introduce you to

131
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:38.463
one powerful multi-agent orchestration

132
00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:40.605
solution. The one agent

133
00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:42.840
rule them all. The

134
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.322
Orchestrator Agent. This is

135
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:46.883
the single interface pattern

136
00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:48.905
applied to your fleet

137
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.105
of agents. It's an

138
00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:51.926
existing engineering paradigm that

139
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:53.808
great engineers have used

140
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:55.569
for decades. We're applying

141
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.132
the single interface pattern

142
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:58.453
to agents. But it's

143
00:03:58.552 --> 00:03:59.854
not just the Orchestrator

144
00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:01.115
Agent that matters. We're
