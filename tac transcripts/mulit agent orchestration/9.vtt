WEBVTT

165
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:31.293
SDK and we're setting

166
00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:32.992
up only two things.

167
00:04:32.992 --> 00:04:34.791
We're modifying just two

168
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.571
aspects of this agent,

169
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:38.149
but it changes everything.

170
00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.910
So you can see

171
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.668
Cloud4Sonnet and here the

172
00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:42.307
system prompt. So let's

173
00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:43.007
open up the system

174
00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:43.687
prompt. You can see

175
00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:44.786
we have this dedicated

176
00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.266
load system prompt method.

177
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:47.064
There's the path to

178
00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:48.264
the prompt. Let's open

179
00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:50.843
it. We have completely

180
00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:52.901
overwritten the Claude Code

181
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.701
system prompt with this

182
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.581
title of our agent

183
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:56.680
purpose. And we have

184
00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.259
a simple three line

185
00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.379
instruction. You are a

186
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.576
Pong agent, always respond
