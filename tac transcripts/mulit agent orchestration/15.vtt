283
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.120
create agent, and then

284
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.401
three command calls. Already,

285
00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:33.442
we have this very

286
00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:34.983
interesting pattern of our

287
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.702
orchestrator agent taking our

288
00:07:36.843 --> 00:07:38.223
high-level prompt and then

289
00:07:38.403 --> 00:07:39.963
writing out in much

290
00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:42.024
more detail the actual

291
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:43.875
concrete work that we

292
00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:45.403
want done to our

293
00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:47.125
agents. Already, this is

294
00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:49.026
a differentiated experience. I

295
00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.127
know right away some

296
00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:51.028
engineers are gonna think,

297
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:52.511
aren't these just sub-agents?

298
00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:53.432
Why aren't you just

299
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.913
using sub-agents? Having a

300
00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:57.295
primary agent here connected

301
00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:59.437
to your orchestrator agent

302
00:07:59.738 --> 00:08:01.100
is differentiated. You're gonna
