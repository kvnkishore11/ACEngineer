781
00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:31.700
Now that the job

782
00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:32.921
is done, whatever work

783
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.682
you needed your agent

784
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:35.182
to complete, it's finished,

785
00:18:35.403 --> 00:18:36.163
okay? Now we can

786
00:18:36.183 --> 00:18:37.746
do something very powerful.

787
00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:38.707
There's a journey that

788
00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:40.428
every engineer goes through.

789
00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:41.689
First, you learn how

790
00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:42.730
to read code, then

791
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.872
you create code, then

792
00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:44.992
you update code, and

793
00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:46.173
then in the end,

794
00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.094
you learn that the

795
00:18:47.255 --> 00:18:48.595
best code is no

796
00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:50.016
code at all. You

797
00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:51.676
learn to delete. Command

798
00:18:51.717 --> 00:18:54.499
K, delete all agents.

799
00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:56.119
Agentic engineering is no

800
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.921
different. You must treat

801
00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.301
your agents as deleteable

802
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:01.722
temporary resources that serve
