1316
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.201
come back to this

1317
00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.321
pattern. I explore these

1318
00:30:31.342 --> 00:30:32.163
patterns all the time,

1319
00:30:32.202 --> 00:30:33.223
right? But I'm here

1320
00:30:33.403 --> 00:30:34.104
sharing this with you

1321
00:30:34.304 --> 00:30:36.286
because this experience, this

1322
00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:38.227
DX, this developer experience

1323
00:30:38.307 --> 00:30:40.468
is differentiated. Something is

1324
00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:42.509
different about this combination

1325
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:44.151
of UI, of UX,

1326
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.832
of agent understanding and

1327
00:30:45.932 --> 00:30:47.814
agent communication. It's all

1328
00:30:47.834 --> 00:30:48.493
about the flow of

1329
00:30:48.554 --> 00:30:50.255
information between your agents

1330
00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:52.016
and understanding how you

1331
00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.867
can peer into the

1332
00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:54.630
core four to get

1333
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.811
more, better, faster results.

1334
00:30:57.332 --> 00:30:59.192
We used a sub-agent

1335
00:30:59.212 --> 00:30:59.953
template to build a
