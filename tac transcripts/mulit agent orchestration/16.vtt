302
00:07:59.738 --> 00:08:01.100
is differentiated. You're gonna

303
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.060
see this over and

304
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.182
over and over. We

305
00:08:03.223 --> 00:08:03.903
can do a lot

306
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.264
more when we control

307
00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:07.326
our agentic units with

308
00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:08.869
our orchestrator agent. So

309
00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:09.649
some of our fast

310
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:10.810
agents here running Haiku,

311
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:12.572
they're of course going

312
00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:13.374
to get work done

313
00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:14.675
quite a bit faster

314
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:15.576
and when they complete

315
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:16.737
their work, you're going

316
00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:18.119
to see something very,

317
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.940
very powerful. And you'll

318
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:20.982
notice throughout all of

319
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:22.863
this, our orchestrator agent

320
00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:24.846
has stopped doing work,

321
00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:26.947
right? Its orchestration tasks

322
00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:28.529
for the meantime is

323
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:30.612
completed. It has created
