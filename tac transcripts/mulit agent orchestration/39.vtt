821
00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:30.079
their context window, okay?

822
00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:31.359
Focusing your agent on

823
00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:33.901
one task sidesteps all

824
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.520
of these context issues,

825
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.040
okay? Context rot, context

826
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.442
pollution, toxic context, whatever

827
00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:40.142
you want to call

828
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:40.741
it. You want your

829
00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:41.942
agents to be just

830
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.241
like you, a focus

831
00:19:43.342 --> 00:19:44.522
engineer working on a

832
00:19:44.782 --> 00:19:45.942
single task at a

833
00:19:46.042 --> 00:19:47.863
time. Let your agents

834
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.443
focus, all right? And

835
00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:51.743
multi-agent orchestration with our

836
00:19:51.884 --> 00:19:53.204
O agent lets us

837
00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.404
do just that. What

838
00:19:54.424 --> 00:19:55.085
are we doing here?

839
00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:56.026
We're tapping into the

840
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.166
R and D framework.

841
00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.646
We discussed this inside

842
00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.708
of the Elite Context
