1926
00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:00.384
our builder is going

1927
00:44:00.543 --> 00:44:01.085
to hand it off

1928
00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:02.746
to our reviewer agent.

1929
00:44:02.786 --> 00:44:03.306
All right, so that's

1930
00:44:03.347 --> 00:44:04.909
this three-step workflow. You

1931
00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:05.829
can see our agent

1932
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:07.813
plan complete. It's summarizing

1933
00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:08.813
that work. And now

1934
00:44:08.873 --> 00:44:10.766
our orchestrator is working

1935
00:44:10.766 --> 00:44:12.543
on phase two. Check

1936
00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:13.324
this out, right? The

1937
00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:14.909
orchestrator itself has written

1938
00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:16.552
out a comprehensive plan

1939
00:44:16.773 --> 00:44:18.297
for the builder because

1940
00:44:18.338 --> 00:44:20.061
it's understood the work.

1941
00:44:20.246 --> 00:44:21.385
Okay. It understands the

1942
00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:22.025
work that our first

1943
00:44:22.085 --> 00:44:22.927
agent has done. The

1944
00:44:23.086 --> 00:44:24.327
orchestrator is now a

1945
00:44:24.487 --> 00:44:25.967
part of connecting the

1946
00:44:26.027 --> 00:44:27.166
workflow, right? It's glue

1947
00:44:27.306 --> 00:44:28.288
for the workflow. I

1948
00:44:28.307 --> 00:44:29.467
think this is vastly

1949
00:44:29.507 --> 00:44:31.268
superior to agent handoffs.
