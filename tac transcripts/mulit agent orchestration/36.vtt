WEBVTT

756
00:17:59.943 --> 00:18:00.484
is great, right? We

757
00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:01.546
got a key summary

758
00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.086
here. You can see

759
00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:02.946
all the key technologies

760
00:18:02.988 --> 00:18:03.848
we used for the

761
00:18:03.888 --> 00:18:04.829
front end. And this

762
00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:05.570
was a great summary

763
00:18:05.631 --> 00:18:06.852
written up by our

764
00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:08.814
fast front end keyway

765
00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:09.715
agent. So this is

766
00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:11.397
fantastic. We can hop

767
00:18:11.518 --> 00:18:12.278
in the loop when

768
00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:13.119
we need to, when

769
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.441
we understand what's done,

770
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.142
we're back out the

771
00:18:15.182 --> 00:18:16.763
loop. We are constantly

772
00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:17.625
moving from in loop

773
00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:18.546
to out loop and

774
00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:20.347
the multi-agent orchestration with

775
00:18:20.387 --> 00:18:21.799
the O agent helps

776
00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:23.270
us reduce our presence,

777
00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:24.752
it helps us understand

778
00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:25.333
what our agents are

779
00:18:25.353 --> 00:18:26.453
doing, and it helps

780
00:18:26.493 --> 00:18:28.296
us scale our agents.
