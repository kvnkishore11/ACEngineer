11
00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:31.768
compute to scale your

12
00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:33.308
impact. Then once you

13
00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:34.548
learn to delegate work

14
00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:36.226
to sub agents and

15
00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.146
new primary agents, there's

16
00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:40.125
only one place left

17
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.823
to go, custom agents.

18
00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.243
But why? Isn't Claude

19
00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.481
Code, Codex CLI, the

20
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.201
Gemini CLI enough. The

21
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:49.360
out-of-the-box agents are incredible,

22
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.460
but there's a massive

23
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.040
problem with these tools.

24
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.701
They're built for everyone's

25
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.700
codebase, not yours. This

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.200
mismatch can cost you

27
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.579
hundreds of hours and

28
00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.659
millions of tokens, scaling
