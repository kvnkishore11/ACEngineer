3243
01:06:29.846 --> 01:06:32.346
and deploying effective agents

3244
01:06:32.346 --> 01:06:33.485
is all about finding

3245
01:06:33.485 --> 01:06:34.764
the constraints in your

3246
01:06:34.764 --> 01:06:36.324
personal workflow and in

3247
01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:37.742
your products. Think about

3248
01:06:37.742 --> 01:06:39.023
repeat workflows that can

3249
01:06:39.023 --> 01:06:40.322
benefit from an agent

3250
01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:41.340
inside of a script,

3251
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.521
a data stream, an

3252
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:43.880
interactive terminal, all the

3253
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.420
way up to user

3254
01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.898
interfaces that can tackle

3255
01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:47.579
high return on investment

3256
01:06:47.579 --> 01:06:49.137
problems in your tools

3257
01:06:49.137 --> 01:06:50.297
for your team and

3258
01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.876
for your business. Agented

3259
01:06:51.876 --> 01:06:53.255
coding is not so

3260
01:06:53.255 --> 01:06:54.215
much about what we

3261
01:06:54.215 --> 01:06:54.974
can do anymore. It's

3262
01:06:54.974 --> 01:06:55.554
about what we can

3263
01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:57.014
teach our agents to

3264
01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:57.934
do. This is how

3265
01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:58.733
we push our compute

3266
01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:00.413
to its useful limits.
