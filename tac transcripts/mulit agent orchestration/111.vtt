2469
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.782
manage our compute better

2470
00:55:30.954 --> 00:55:32.096
faster than ever before.

2471
00:55:32.275 --> 00:55:33.018
Give this a shot.

2472
00:55:33.177 --> 00:55:33.719
And if you see

2473
00:55:33.978 --> 00:55:35.561
big AI labs picking

2474
00:55:35.581 --> 00:55:37.125
this concept up, remember

2475
00:55:37.164 --> 00:55:37.826
where you saw this

2476
00:55:37.885 --> 00:55:39.728
first. Great work here.

2477
00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:41.271
I hope the gears

2478
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:42.233
are turning in your

2479
00:55:42.293 --> 00:55:44.336
engineering mind. The orchestrator

2480
00:55:44.478 --> 00:55:45.860
agent private codebase

2481
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.661
will be available to

2482
00:55:46.762 --> 00:55:48.224
you. Link available in

2483
00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.581
your loot box. Any

2484
00:55:49.661 --> 00:55:51.204
release or system that

2485
00:55:51.244 --> 00:55:52.807
enables you to increase

2486
00:55:52.927 --> 00:55:54.510
the information rate between

2487
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:55.452
your agents and your

2488
00:55:55.532 --> 00:55:57.235
work requires your attention,

2489
00:55:57.315 --> 00:55:58.496
requires your focus. The

2490
00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:00.561
orchestrator agent is one
