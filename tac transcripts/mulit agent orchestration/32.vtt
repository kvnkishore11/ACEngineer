658
00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:01.155
specialized, dedicated, focused agents,

659
00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:02.316
right, focused on one

660
00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:03.876
specific task. This is

661
00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:04.876
important. We're gonna touch

662
00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:05.197
on that in a

663
00:16:05.238 --> 00:16:06.077
moment. And then our

664
00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:08.198
orchestrator agent is communicating

665
00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:09.038
to us, okay? We

666
00:16:09.078 --> 00:16:10.419
can continue our work.

667
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.201
This is the powerful

668
00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.140
part of having a

669
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:14.142
system like this, okay?

670
00:16:14.293 --> 00:16:15.315
build anything we need

671
00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:15.754
to to get the

672
00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:16.794
job done. So you

673
00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:17.235
can see here, we

674
00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:17.635
have a bunch of

675
00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:18.697
metadata. We'll cover that

676
00:16:18.697 --> 00:16:19.356
in just a moment.

677
00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:20.217
Let's just run this.

678
00:16:20.238 --> 00:16:21.457
I'll say command all

679
00:16:21.538 --> 00:16:23.460
agents, create one section,

680
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.260
a single sentence of

681
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:27.182
each key node in

682
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:28.903
the system. Quick, concise,

683
00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:30.464
enable thinking. All right,
