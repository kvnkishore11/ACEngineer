1431
00:33:28.546 --> 00:33:30.247
single agents, a lot

1432
00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:31.887
of engineers are barely

1433
00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:34.269
using their agent's potential.

1434
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.171
Okay, I'm going to

1435
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.374
use our orchestrator, scout

1436
00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:39.336
and build, create simple,

1437
00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:41.859
flat, colorless, gray pills

1438
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.881
for the app header,

1439
00:33:43.481 --> 00:33:44.703
information tense keyword there.

1440
00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:45.704
This is a location

1441
00:33:45.765 --> 00:33:46.465
in the codebase,

1442
00:33:46.987 --> 00:33:48.469
active, running logs. This

1443
00:33:48.489 --> 00:33:49.289
is up here, right?

1444
00:33:49.309 --> 00:33:50.491
So the running cost

1445
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:51.613
displays. So we're just

1446
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:52.653
gonna create some simple

1447
00:33:52.694 --> 00:33:54.076
UI pills. This is

1448
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:54.737
a simple one off

1449
00:33:54.797 --> 00:33:55.678
task. I just wanna

1450
00:33:55.798 --> 00:33:57.840
showcase this prompt to

1451
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.741
you. We are now

1452
00:33:58.781 --> 00:33:59.442
going to get our

1453
00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:01.724
orchestrator involved in this
