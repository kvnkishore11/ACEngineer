349
00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:00.975
have reasoning. You can

350
00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:01.977
see here, none of

351
00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:02.798
our agents here are

352
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.941
thinking they're not reasoning

353
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.163
at all. That's okay

354
00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:06.666
for these tasks. We

355
00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:07.527
of course have our

356
00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:09.190
models and our costs.

357
00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:11.432
Now, something incredible just

358
00:09:11.494 --> 00:09:12.414
happened. As you can

359
00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:13.777
see here, our primary

360
00:09:14.118 --> 00:09:16.120
QA agent has finished

361
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.482
its work. We have

362
00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:19.466
its consumed assets, and

363
00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:22.126
it's produced assets. Engineering

364
00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:23.966
is all about communicating

365
00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:26.148
work. So your multi-agent

366
00:09:26.227 --> 00:09:28.269
system should reflect that.

367
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:29.729
It should showcase that.

368
00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:30.688
And so right here
