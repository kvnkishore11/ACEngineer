1667
00:38:29.527 --> 00:38:31.230
our orchestrator knows If

1668
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.911
the work is done,

1669
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:33.112
there it goes. Updating

1670
00:38:33.132 --> 00:38:34.293
its to-dos, it has

1671
00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:35.173
that as a tool

1672
00:38:35.273 --> 00:38:36.135
as well. And our

1673
00:38:36.295 --> 00:38:37.896
orchestrator, our agents, they're

1674
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:40.320
working together. I think

1675
00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:40.940
you get the point,

1676
00:38:41.001 --> 00:38:42.722
right? We have multi-agent

1677
00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:44.063
orchestration. This is the

1678
00:38:44.204 --> 00:38:46.085
first true working example,

1679
00:38:46.226 --> 00:38:47.668
first true working paradigm

1680
00:38:47.987 --> 00:38:49.449
I've seen of orchestration

1681
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.510
over long periods of

1682
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.713
time for serious engineering

1683
00:38:52.753 --> 00:38:53.755
work where you can

1684
00:38:54.034 --> 00:38:55.376
actually peer into the

1685
00:38:55.476 --> 00:38:56.717
system. You can see

1686
00:38:56.858 --> 00:38:57.759
what's going on. If

1687
00:38:57.818 --> 00:39:00.141
something went wrong, I
