1246
00:28:59.084 --> 00:29:00.444
on that now. Regex,

1247
00:29:00.444 --> 00:29:02.049
Scout, You can see

1248
00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:03.029
we only have RegEx

1249
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.651
Scout searches here, so

1250
00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:05.211
on and so forth.

1251
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.310
As always, we have

1252
00:29:06.351 --> 00:29:08.830
our concrete results, right?

1253
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:09.692
We can one click

1254
00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:10.791
into the results and

1255
00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:11.652
actually read this and

1256
00:29:11.672 --> 00:29:12.412
understand what it is

1257
00:29:12.531 --> 00:29:12.951
if we need to

1258
00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:13.971
hop into the loop,

1259
00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:14.792
all right? But of

1260
00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:15.893
course, we don't. We

1261
00:29:15.913 --> 00:29:16.833
have a great Peter

1262
00:29:16.893 --> 00:29:18.032
system. We can just

1263
00:29:18.093 --> 00:29:18.772
quickly look at the

1264
00:29:18.792 --> 00:29:19.534
results at a high

1265
00:29:19.554 --> 00:29:20.894
level and just move

1266
00:29:21.074 --> 00:29:22.554
on, okay? So I

1267
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:23.034
hope you can see

1268
00:29:23.534 --> 00:29:24.535
some trends here, right?

1269
00:29:24.615 --> 00:29:26.795
My agentic engineering velocity

1270
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.654
right now is insane.

1271
00:29:28.815 --> 00:29:30.635
It's insanely high. We
