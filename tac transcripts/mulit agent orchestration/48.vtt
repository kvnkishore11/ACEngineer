1021
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.173
into a great agent

1022
00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.674
decoding ecosystem. We can

1023
00:24:02.755 --> 00:24:03.955
also do this, right?

1024
00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:04.896
If I type slash

1025
00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:06.018
prime, Guess what's gonna

1026
00:24:06.038 --> 00:24:07.117
happen here to our

1027
00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:08.739
primary agent? Our primary

1028
00:24:08.818 --> 00:24:09.739
agent is going to

1029
00:24:09.858 --> 00:24:11.199
run the prime command.

1030
00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:12.838
It's going to understand

1031
00:24:12.898 --> 00:24:13.619
this codebase. If

1032
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.400
you've been following my

1033
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.220
work for a while,

1034
00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:16.740
you understand what prime

1035
00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:17.599
is. This is a

1036
00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.340
user activated memory file

1037
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.641
that gets your agent

1038
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:23.061
focused on a specific

1039
00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:23.842
task. You can set

1040
00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:24.961
up a generic slash

1041
00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:26.061
prime, right? Like we

1042
00:24:26.082 --> 00:24:26.622
have in this code

1043
00:24:26.642 --> 00:24:27.422
base. This is nothing

1044
00:24:27.442 --> 00:24:28.042
new. You've seen this

1045
00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:29.702
before, right? Slash prime

1046
00:24:29.762 --> 00:24:31.403
here, just a simple
