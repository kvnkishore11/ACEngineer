2445
00:54:59.626 --> 00:55:00.668
are issues, you know,

2446
00:55:00.788 --> 00:55:01.409
in this codebase,

2447
00:55:01.409 --> 00:55:03.510
in this entire methodology

2448
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.891
of operating. I fully

2449
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:05.570
admit to that. There

2450
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.052
are trade-offs everywhere. There

2451
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:08.733
always are. But it's

2452
00:55:08.813 --> 00:55:10.472
clear this pattern is

2453
00:55:10.532 --> 00:55:12.173
viable for scaling your

2454
00:55:12.213 --> 00:55:13.594
agentic engineering. Give this

2455
00:55:13.635 --> 00:55:14.335
a shot. You can

2456
00:55:14.355 --> 00:55:15.335
see our reviewer just

2457
00:55:15.376 --> 00:55:16.016
came in with the

2458
00:55:16.076 --> 00:55:17.315
review. We can one-click

2459
00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:18.976
into the loop, understand

2460
00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:20.117
what's been done, and

2461
00:55:20.157 --> 00:55:21.157
then we can get

2462
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:21.898
out of the loop,

2463
00:55:22.177 --> 00:55:22.679
go back to the

2464
00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:23.798
high level. We can,

2465
00:55:23.798 --> 00:55:24.798
of course, clean up

2466
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.079
our agents with a

2467
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.320
single command. We can

2468
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.760
control it all and

2469
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.782
manage our compute better
