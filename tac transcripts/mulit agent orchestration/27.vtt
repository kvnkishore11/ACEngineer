549
00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:31.056
multi-agent orchestration. So we

550
00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:31.836
can dive into any

551
00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:32.658
one of these results.

552
00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:33.519
You can see here

553
00:13:33.658 --> 00:13:35.520
our back-end QA agent

554
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.562
went pretty hard here

555
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:37.623
on the back-end docs.

556
00:13:37.982 --> 00:13:39.004
This is all fantastic.

557
00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:39.644
We can of course

558
00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:40.706
dive into any of

559
00:13:40.725 --> 00:13:41.667
this if we want

560
00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:42.528
to with a single

561
00:13:42.607 --> 00:13:43.589
click and we'll be

562
00:13:43.688 --> 00:13:45.009
taken right into the

563
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.272
piece of documentation that

564
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.312
we can then tweak,

565
00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:48.673
delete, modify, and so

566
00:13:48.714 --> 00:13:49.154
on and so forth.

567
00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:53.418
Another massive advantage of

568
00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.019
our orchestration system is

569
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.785
this. It's designed to

570
00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:58.027
help us manage our

571
00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.288
agents at scale. Okay,
