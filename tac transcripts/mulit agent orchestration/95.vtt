WEBVTT

2097
00:47:28.724 --> 00:47:30.027
the database, the WebSocket

2098
00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.168
connections. It can be

2099
00:47:31.467 --> 00:47:32.650
a lot to coordinate.

2100
00:47:32.789 --> 00:47:33.250
If you know what

2101
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.210
you're doing, this application

2102
00:47:34.291 --> 00:47:35.612
is relatively simple. We

2103
00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:36.813
have WebSocket events coming

2104
00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:37.335
to the front end,

2105
00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:38.155
we have some HTTP

2106
00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:39.137
events, we're using the

2107
00:47:39.277 --> 00:47:40.597
agent SDK and we're

2108
00:47:40.617 --> 00:47:41.079
saving it to a

2109
00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:42.639
database. But things can

2110
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.061
and will get complex

2111
00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.382
This is another piece

2112
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:46.384
of your agentic layer

2113
00:47:46.443 --> 00:47:47.644
you'll have to maintain.

2114
00:47:47.804 --> 00:47:48.644
So that's the big

2115
00:47:48.724 --> 00:47:50.065
trade-off. Is this worth

2116
00:47:50.085 --> 00:47:52.047
investing into? I think

2117
00:47:52.387 --> 00:47:52.949
the answer is a

2118
00:47:53.048 --> 00:47:54.409
very clear yes. You

2119
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:55.550
want to have, even

2120
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.130
if you don't use

2121
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.251
this, the key here

2122
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:57.692
is that you want

2123
00:47:57.711 --> 00:47:58.952
to have some type

2124
00:47:59.092 --> 00:48:01.215
of Outloop agentic coding
