1756
00:40:29.811 --> 00:40:30.791
little better. Obviously the

1757
00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:31.231
work is done. We

1758
00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:31.972
have the pills there.

1759
00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:33.373
Okay. So let's deploy

1760
00:40:33.452 --> 00:40:34.432
one more task and

1761
00:40:34.452 --> 00:40:36.054
then let's talk about

1762
00:40:36.253 --> 00:40:37.114
operating in the gray.

1763
00:40:37.153 --> 00:40:37.695
Let's talk about the

1764
00:40:37.855 --> 00:40:39.235
realism around these types

1765
00:40:39.275 --> 00:40:40.416
of systems. I want

1766
00:40:40.416 --> 00:40:42.677
to talk off, limitations,

1767
00:40:42.797 --> 00:40:43.818
what's missing, and then

1768
00:40:43.818 --> 00:40:44.637
we'll talk about what's

1769
00:40:44.737 --> 00:40:46.579
next for Agentic Horizon

1770
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.900
and what opportunity is

1771
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.981
available for your Agentic

1772
00:40:50.161 --> 00:40:51.643
Engineering. Once again, the

1773
00:40:51.722 --> 00:40:53.083
agents are done, clear

1774
00:40:53.463 --> 00:40:54.605
all agents. And then

1775
00:40:54.605 --> 00:40:55.806
we're gonna fire off

1776
00:40:56.041 --> 00:40:57.963
another workflow pushing the

1777
00:40:58.003 --> 00:40:59.144
compute even further. Let's

1778
00:40:59.184 --> 00:40:59.726
go ahead and clear

1779
00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:01.246
all here. Our orchestrator
