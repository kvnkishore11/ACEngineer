1336
00:31:00.013 --> 00:31:01.674
new primary agent with

1337
00:31:01.954 --> 00:31:05.356
dedicated settings. We specialized

1338
00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:06.577
the agent. Let me

1339
00:31:06.637 --> 00:31:06.998
just go ahead and

1340
00:31:07.057 --> 00:31:07.659
open this up again.

1341
00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:08.179
And I just wanna

1342
00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:09.619
mention one big idea

1343
00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.820
here. If we just

1344
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.182
collapse, course, prompt engineering

1345
00:31:13.442 --> 00:31:15.183
is the skill, context

1346
00:31:15.223 --> 00:31:16.785
engineering is the skill

1347
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:18.685
inside of this agent

1348
00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:19.490
you know, in the

1349
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.991
system prompt of this

1350
00:31:21.132 --> 00:31:22.973
agent, we have once

1351
00:31:23.013 --> 00:31:24.835
again, templated our engineering.

1352
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:26.056
We have a dedicated

1353
00:31:26.477 --> 00:31:28.357
scout report, a dedicated

1354
00:31:28.818 --> 00:31:30.160
structure that we want
