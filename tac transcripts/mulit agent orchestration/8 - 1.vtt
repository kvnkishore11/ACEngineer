00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:01.115
Agent that matters. We're

145
00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.377
combining three pillars. The

146
00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:05.558
Orchestrator Agent, your unified

147
00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.180
interface to your agents.

148
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.502
Your Orchestrator Agent unlocks

149
00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:11.477
CRUD for your agents.

150
00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:13.000
This gives you agents

151
00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:14.704
at scale. And lastly,

152
00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:16.887
we're combining observability for

153
00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:18.711
real-time monitoring of your

154
00:04:18.812 --> 00:04:20.918
agent's performance costs, and

155
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.541
as you'll see, results.

156
00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:23.704
When you combine these

157
00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:24.586
three, you get a

158
00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:27.250
powerful solution to multi-agent

159
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.113
orchestration. This is you

160
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:30.958
controlling your compute at
