WEBVTT

1549
00:35:58.976 --> 00:36:00.539
put these exact files.

1550
00:36:00.579 --> 00:36:01.300
Of course, we can

1551
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.021
one click in, we

1552
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:03.083
can understand what's gonna

1553
00:36:03.262 --> 00:36:04.264
happen. The main thing

1554
00:36:04.304 --> 00:36:04.885
here is that the

1555
00:36:05.065 --> 00:36:06.027
app header is gonna

1556
00:36:06.047 --> 00:36:07.289
have a couple items

1557
00:36:07.489 --> 00:36:09.030
updated, right? Problem statement,

1558
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.293
execution summary, blah, blah,

1559
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:11.554
blah, all right? Classic

1560
00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:12.936
agent decoding. Now our

1561
00:36:13.115 --> 00:36:14.617
orchestrator agent, still with

1562
00:36:14.759 --> 00:36:16.300
very minimal context. Keep

1563
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.942
in mind how much

1564
00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:18.864
work this orchestrator has

1565
00:36:18.903 --> 00:36:19.744
conducted up to this

1566
00:36:19.824 --> 00:36:20.927
point, okay? And this

1567
00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:22.728
context still floating along,

1568
00:36:22.768 --> 00:36:23.570
it's because we are

1569
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.266
indeed all of the

1570
00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:27.086
context, reduced, and delegated.

1571
00:36:27.347 --> 00:36:28.889
We have multi primary

1572
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.572
agents operating the actual
