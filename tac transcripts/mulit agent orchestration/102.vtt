2260
00:51:00.179 --> 00:51:00.860
all of it here

2261
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.684
with our observability interface.

2262
00:51:02.864 --> 00:51:04.126
So our agent's finished.

2263
00:51:04.465 --> 00:51:05.507
Let's see how it's

2264
00:51:05.567 --> 00:51:06.847
done here. Fantastic. So

2265
00:51:06.987 --> 00:51:07.387
you can see that

2266
00:51:07.407 --> 00:51:08.228
that worked, right? If

2267
00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:09.510
we go into large

2268
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:10.690
mode here and let's

2269
00:51:10.871 --> 00:51:13.193
shrink right around, at

2270
00:51:13.213 --> 00:51:15.213
around 650, we should

2271
00:51:15.253 --> 00:51:16.394
see collapse. There it

2272
00:51:16.454 --> 00:51:17.396
is. Nice. So you

2273
00:51:17.396 --> 00:51:18.376
can see our shortened

2274
00:51:18.376 --> 00:51:18.976
windows and then it

2275
00:51:19.077 --> 00:51:19.998
sizes up and you

2276
00:51:19.998 --> 00:51:20.677
know, we can collapse

2277
00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:21.298
this and just see

2278
00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.338
our collapse mode here,

2279
00:51:22.358 --> 00:51:22.760
get a little bit

2280
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.820
more space. That's what

2281
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.621
that looks like. So

2282
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.641
this feature shipped, we're

2283
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:26.702
now having our reviewer

2284
00:51:26.862 --> 00:51:29.070
agent confirm that the

2285
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.326
work was done. So,
