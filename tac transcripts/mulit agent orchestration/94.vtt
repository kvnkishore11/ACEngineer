2077
00:46:58.862 --> 00:47:00.643
powerful workflows than you

2078
00:47:00.704 --> 00:47:01.565
think you can. You

2079
00:47:01.605 --> 00:47:03.505
can command more compute

2080
00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:04.347
to get more work

2081
00:47:04.487 --> 00:47:05.168
done. If you wanna

2082
00:47:05.208 --> 00:47:05.768
take this to the

2083
00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:07.929
next level, multi-agent orchestration

2084
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.070
is waiting for you.

2085
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:10.132
Now, there are of

2086
00:47:10.211 --> 00:47:12.414
course trade-offs to this.

2087
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.411
The real trade off

2088
00:47:15.431 --> 00:47:16.472
here, the real balance

2089
00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:17.612
is that this takes

2090
00:47:17.713 --> 00:47:19.135
time to build, right?

2091
00:47:19.315 --> 00:47:21.838
Very obviously multi-agent orchestration

2092
00:47:22.257 --> 00:47:23.659
and the O-agent cost

2093
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.342
upfront investment and you

2094
00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:26.623
have to manage your

2095
00:47:26.682 --> 00:47:27.704
orchestration agent, you have

2096
00:47:27.704 --> 00:47:28.644
to manage the plumbing,

2097
00:47:28.724 --> 00:47:30.027
the database, the WebSocket
