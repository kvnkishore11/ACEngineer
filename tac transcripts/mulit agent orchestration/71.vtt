WEBVTT

1524
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:30.570
you can use. And

1525
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.331
we're doing it with

1526
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:32.530
our orchestrator agents. So

1527
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.610
we're getting our orchestrator

1528
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.010
involved here. We're scaling

1529
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.731
up the compute to

1530
00:35:35.931 --> 00:35:38.032
monitor this multi-agent workflow.

1531
00:35:38.172 --> 00:35:39.251
And so every 15

1532
00:35:39.251 --> 00:35:40.112
seconds is going to

1533
00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:41.913
run check agent status

1534
00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:42.992
on the scatter to

1535
00:35:43.213 --> 00:35:44.032
see how the scatter

1536
00:35:44.072 --> 00:35:44.693
is doing. And so

1537
00:35:44.972 --> 00:35:45.514
you can see there

1538
00:35:45.733 --> 00:35:47.253
scatter has just finished

1539
00:35:47.253 --> 00:35:47.974
this work. We're not

1540
00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:48.494
going to get our

1541
00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:50.695
produced assets, right? Every

1542
00:35:50.835 --> 00:35:52.514
agent must produce a

1543
00:35:52.594 --> 00:35:54.135
concrete result. Otherwise, what's

1544
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:54.855
the point? We can

1545
00:35:54.855 --> 00:35:55.695
of course dial in,

1546
00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:56.255
we can see the

1547
00:35:56.315 --> 00:35:57.596
summary there and it

1548
00:35:57.596 --> 00:35:58.896
knows exactly where to

1549
00:35:58.976 --> 00:36:00.539
put these exact files.
