00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:30.154
concrete mermaid diagrams. We

413
00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:31.015
have our front end

414
00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:32.096
layer of a pina

415
00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:32.857
store, We have our

416
00:10:32.977 --> 00:10:33.879
services, all right? So

417
00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.600
we're running HTTP and

418
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.102
we're running WebSocket. So

419
00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:37.783
we're using both of

420
00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:38.703
these to connect to

421
00:10:38.783 --> 00:10:39.865
our backend. In our

422
00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:41.147
orchestrator service, we are

423
00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:42.227
of course using the

424
00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:44.711
Claude Agent SDK. Claude

425
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.971
code is the best

426
00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:47.913
agentic coding tool. It's

427
00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:49.095
not just the agent

428
00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:50.196
or the agent harness

429
00:10:50.397 --> 00:10:51.364
that makes this tool

430
00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:52.618
great. It is the

431
00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:55.058
extensibility of this tool.

432
00:10:55.099 --> 00:10:55.619
We can build up

433
00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:58.499
powerful multi-agent orchestration systems

434
00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.759
like this, thanks to

435
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.460
how pluggable the Cloud
