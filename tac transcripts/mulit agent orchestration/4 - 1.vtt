68
00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:01.099
pay down to build

69
00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.581
this layer. So what

70
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.221
if we had an

71
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.384
intermediate step, a system

72
00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:06.745
of agents that helps

73
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.026
us build before we

74
00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:09.146
have an agentic layer

75
00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:10.709
and while we have

76
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.930
an agentic layer? Because

77
00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.510
at scale, if you

78
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.391
lose track of your

79
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.253
agents, you lose control

80
00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:17.838
of your results in

81
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.300
the generative AI age,

82
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:20.562
the rate at which

83
00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:21.943
you can create and

84
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.965
command your agents becomes

85
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.066
the constraint of your

86
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.546
engineering output. When your

87
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:27.747
agents are slow, you're

88
00:02:27.788 --> 00:02:28.808
slow. When your agents

89
00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.110
have a problem, you
