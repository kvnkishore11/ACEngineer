1645
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.293
we have observability. These

1646
00:38:01.353 --> 00:38:03.753
three design elements unlock

1647
00:38:04.213 --> 00:38:05.614
something special. And this

1648
00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:06.054
is what I want

1649
00:38:06.074 --> 00:38:07.373
to share here with

1650
00:38:07.434 --> 00:38:08.614
you today. Here's that

1651
00:38:08.693 --> 00:38:09.875
summary coming in from

1652
00:38:09.934 --> 00:38:11.934
our specialized agent. All

1653
00:38:11.934 --> 00:38:12.474
right, there it is.

1654
00:38:12.514 --> 00:38:13.675
There's the changes, 36

1655
00:38:13.675 --> 00:38:14.856
added, four removed. Click

1656
00:38:14.936 --> 00:38:15.923
into this and we

1657
00:38:15.923 --> 00:38:17.637
can see the We

1658
00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:19.338
now have that stat

1659
00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:21.039
pill and it is

1660
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.742
working as expected. Let's

1661
00:38:22.762 --> 00:38:23.483
hop back out the

1662
00:38:23.563 --> 00:38:24.844
loop and just continue

1663
00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:25.824
to observe our agents

1664
00:38:25.844 --> 00:38:27.025
completing. We have a

1665
00:38:27.146 --> 00:38:28.527
response followed by a

1666
00:38:28.688 --> 00:38:29.467
stop. This is how

1667
00:38:29.527 --> 00:38:31.230
our orchestrator knows If
