1354
00:31:28.818 --> 00:31:30.160
structure that we want

1355
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.280
our agent to report

1356
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.902
its results in, okay?

1357
00:31:33.102 --> 00:31:34.963
Templating your engineering inside

1358
00:31:34.963 --> 00:31:36.144
of all these different

1359
00:31:36.184 --> 00:31:37.605
types of compute, right?

1360
00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:40.808
Sub-agents, skills, prompts, reusable

1361
00:31:40.848 --> 00:31:42.631
prompts. It's all about

1362
00:31:42.691 --> 00:31:44.632
encoding the way you

1363
00:31:44.811 --> 00:31:46.074
engineer, encoding the way

1364
00:31:46.253 --> 00:31:47.914
you solve problems. There's

1365
00:31:47.914 --> 00:31:49.556
a key theme of

1366
00:31:49.656 --> 00:31:51.458
Tactical Agentic Coding. You

1367
00:31:51.577 --> 00:31:52.458
need to be putting

1368
00:31:52.538 --> 00:31:54.098
your engineering into your

1369
00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:55.740
agents. This is what

1370
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.941
makes them special. This

1371
00:31:56.961 --> 00:31:57.561
is what gives them

1372
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:00.844
your unique advantage. Something
