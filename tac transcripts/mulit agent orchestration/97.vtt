2147
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.039
wasting your time. The

2148
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.820
right way to think

2149
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.760
about engineering now is

2150
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.121
the agentic way. You

2151
00:48:33.141 --> 00:48:33.902
want to be thinking

2152
00:48:34.063 --> 00:48:37.023
about scaling your agentics.

2153
00:48:37.103 --> 00:48:40.126
Remember, tactic eight, prioritize

2154
00:48:40.286 --> 00:48:42.507
agentics. More than 50%

2155
00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:43.288
of your time as

2156
00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:45.269
a rough guideline should

2157
00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:47.190
be spent investing into

2158
00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:48.911
your agentic layer, into

2159
00:48:48.972 --> 00:48:50.092
your agents, into the

2160
00:48:50.293 --> 00:48:51.795
system that builds the

2161
00:48:52.014 --> 00:48:53.675
system. Okay? Here, very

2162
00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:54.737
clearly with a multi-agent

2163
00:48:54.797 --> 00:48:56.177
orchestration, we have a

2164
00:48:56.297 --> 00:48:57.759
powerful version of that

2165
00:48:57.878 --> 00:48:59.400
that works even before

2166
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.822
you get concrete ADWs
