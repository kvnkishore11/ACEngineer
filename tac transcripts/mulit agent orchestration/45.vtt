951
00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:30.354
again, you can see

952
00:22:30.554 --> 00:22:31.535
all of this metadata

953
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:32.055
we're going to break

954
00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:33.036
down one step at

955
00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:33.756
a time. But right

956
00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:34.636
now let's just do

957
00:22:34.817 --> 00:22:36.665
something simple. Create an

958
00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:37.866
agent to run slash

959
00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:39.228
question and ask if

960
00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:40.868
our orchestrator and agents

961
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:43.050
can use skills. Okay.

962
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:44.531
We're gonna ask a

963
00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:46.233
question. The orchestrator agent

964
00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:48.015
doesn't do work outside

965
00:22:48.055 --> 00:22:49.256
of what it's specialized

966
00:22:49.296 --> 00:22:50.596
to do, which is

967
00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:53.078
conduct and orchestrate other

968
00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:54.079
agents. All right. So

969
00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:54.920
we have our code-based

970
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.101
questionnaire agent that just

971
00:22:56.121 --> 00:22:56.801
got spun up. It

972
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:57.622
looks like our orchestrator

973
00:22:57.662 --> 00:22:58.282
decided this is a

974
00:22:58.383 --> 00:22:59.203
simple task. So it's

975
00:22:59.203 --> 00:22:59.723
just gonna run a

976
00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:00.505
fast model to do
