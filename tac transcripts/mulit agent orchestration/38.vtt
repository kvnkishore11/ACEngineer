802
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:01.722
temporary resources that serve

803
00:19:02.063 --> 00:19:03.104
a single purpose. You

804
00:19:03.124 --> 00:19:04.084
can see three tool

805
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:05.085
calls came in there.

806
00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:06.869
Our orchestrator agent has

807
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.894
blown away our agents.

808
00:19:08.954 --> 00:19:09.915
The work is done,

809
00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:11.259
the job is done.

810
00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:12.421
Let the agents go

811
00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:14.305
home. In Tactical Agent

812
00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:15.548
Agentic Lesson 6, we

813
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:17.270
dial into this concept

814
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:18.934
with one key tactic,

815
00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:20.637
one agent, one prompt,

816
00:19:21.057 --> 00:19:22.238
one purpose. This is

817
00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:24.159
something that 80% plus

818
00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:25.618
of all engineers are

819
00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.459
rediscovering over and over

820
00:19:27.558 --> 00:19:28.659
every time they explode

821
00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:30.079
their context window, okay?
