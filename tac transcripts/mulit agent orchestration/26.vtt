524
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:00.000
is all gonna be

525
00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:00.861
here for you to

526
00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:01.621
check out once you

527
00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:02.422
finish this video. I'm

528
00:13:02.422 --> 00:13:03.142
gonna go ahead and

529
00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:04.062
clean up some of

530
00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:05.302
this documentation. And if

531
00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:06.243
we hop back to

532
00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:07.462
our agentic system, you

533
00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:08.123
can see our front

534
00:13:08.143 --> 00:13:08.702
end and back end

535
00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:10.403
agents have also completed

536
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:11.203
their work. We can

537
00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:12.230
see all the files

538
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.605
they've consumed, we can

539
00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:15.625
see the actual concrete

540
00:13:15.946 --> 00:13:18.587
produced results. Okay. You're

541
00:13:18.628 --> 00:13:19.628
not getting this with

542
00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:20.428
out of the box

543
00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:21.629
agent decoding tools. You're

544
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:22.590
not getting this with

545
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.610
any cloud tool, right?

546
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.812
This is a specialized

547
00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:26.773
solution for managing agents

548
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.573
at scale. This is

549
00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:31.056
multi-agent orchestration. So we
