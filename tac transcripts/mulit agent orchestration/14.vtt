260
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.492
single prompt, I've deployed

261
00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:02.134
three times the compute

262
00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:03.435
an engineer working in

263
00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:05.076
the terminal has, okay?

264
00:07:05.298 --> 00:07:05.877
And this is just

265
00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:06.959
the beginning. We have

266
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.041
two fast agents. We've

267
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:09.963
divided this work into

268
00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.264
front end, back end,

269
00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:11.944
and then we have

270
00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.266
a primary kind of

271
00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:14.747
powerful agent that's going

272
00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:15.488
to do the QA

273
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:16.750
work of summarizing both

274
00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:17.370
the front end and

275
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.232
back end. And our

276
00:07:18.232 --> 00:07:20.598
orchestrator took care of

277
00:07:20.718 --> 00:07:23.139
actually commanding and creating

278
00:07:23.178 --> 00:07:23.879
our agents. If we

279
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:24.879
scroll back up, you

280
00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.160
can see all six

281
00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.220
of those tool calls,

282
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:28.880
create agent, create agent,

283
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.120
create agent, and then
