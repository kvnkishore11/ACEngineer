910
00:21:28.582 --> 00:21:30.403
orchestrator agent is a

911
00:21:30.502 --> 00:21:32.005
custom agent, okay? Its

912
00:21:32.244 --> 00:21:33.746
system prompt is completely

913
00:21:33.865 --> 00:21:35.607
overwritten. Its tools are

914
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:38.150
specialized. It's designed to

915
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:40.571
manage other agents. Using

916
00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.093
the single interface pattern,

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:46.717
creates, deletes, and updates

920
00:21:46.777 --> 00:21:48.739
and manages your agents,

921
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.340
okay? In fact, we

922
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:51.401
can push this even

923
00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:52.762
further, which we're going

924
00:21:52.782 --> 00:21:53.502

925
00:21:53.502 --> 00:21:55.584
future agentic horizon lesson,

926
00:21:56.045 --> 00:21:57.085

927
00:21:57.144 --> 00:21:59.685
entire agentic layer. It

928
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:00.946
