65
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.105
the wrong time. Ultimately,

66
00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.224
custom agents let you

67
00:02:02.224 --> 00:02:04.081
take two tactics of

68
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.480
Agentic Coding to their

69
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.420
limit. They let you

70
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.141
template your engineering, directly

71
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.681
into your agent and

72
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.639
they push the one

73
00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.360
agent, one prompt, one

74
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.519
purpose tactic to its

75
00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.638
limits. And sometimes it's

76
00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.856
not about building 100%

77
00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:20.075
custom agents at all.

78
00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:21.096
By knowing how to

79
00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.495
use programmatic agents like

80
00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.234
the ClaudeCode SDK, you

81
00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:26.332
can deploy out of

82
00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:27.673
the box agents like

83
00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:29.852
ClaudeCode programmatically and just

84
00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:30.971
make a few tweaks
