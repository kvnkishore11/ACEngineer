2285
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.326
work was done. So,

2286
00:51:31.538 --> 00:51:31.878
I hope you can

2287
00:51:31.898 --> 00:51:32.699
see how powerful this

2288
00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:33.980
is, right? Three agents,

2289
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.262
dedicated, 21K, 17K, focus

2290
00:51:37.362 --> 00:51:39.244
context windows, one agent,

2291
00:51:39.344 --> 00:51:40.643
one prompt, one purpose,

2292
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:41.844
focusing in on tactic

2293
00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.106
six, let your agent

2294
00:51:43.186 --> 00:51:43.887
work and then let

2295
00:51:43.907 --> 00:51:44.766
it go home. Big

2296
00:51:44.847 --> 00:51:46.148
labs are going to

2297
00:51:46.168 --> 00:51:46.969
be doing something like

2298
00:51:46.989 --> 00:51:47.829
this, right? You already

2299
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:49.202
see it. with cloud

2300
00:51:49.222 --> 00:51:50.324
coding tools, these are

2301
00:51:50.364 --> 00:51:51.164
coming, all right? And

2302
00:51:51.164 --> 00:51:52.146
there's gonna be many

2303
00:51:52.427 --> 00:51:53.989
varieties of this, right?

2304
00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:54.469
There's gonna be your

2305
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.132
Vibe coding one-shot prompt

2306
00:51:56.152 --> 00:51:57.032
tools, and then there's

2307
00:51:57.032 --> 00:51:58.514
gonna be your legitimate

2308
00:51:58.675 --> 00:52:00.217
engineering tools. Obviously, we're
