1806
00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:30.635
don't realize. Once you

1807
00:41:30.775 --> 00:41:32.077
build a custom agent,

1808
00:41:32.197 --> 00:41:32.938
you can then write

1809
00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:34.960
prompts, specialize for that

1810
00:41:35.021 --> 00:41:36.838
custom agent. Okay, detailed

1811
00:41:36.978 --> 00:41:38.500
for that custom agent.

1812
00:41:38.679 --> 00:41:40.141
This gets ultra, ultra

1813
00:41:40.181 --> 00:41:40.940
powerful. There's a lot

1814
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.402
you can do with

1815
00:41:41.402 --> 00:41:42.081
this, all right? This

1816
00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:42.862
agent is gonna kick

1817
00:41:42.922 --> 00:41:43.762
off. It's going to

1818
00:41:44.224 --> 00:41:45.083
create a bunch of

1819
00:41:45.164 --> 00:41:45.905
agents for us. It's

1820
00:41:45.905 --> 00:41:47.326
going to deploy compute.

1821
00:41:47.326 --> 00:41:48.126
It's gonna handle this

1822
00:41:48.186 --> 00:41:49.186
problem for us, all

1823
00:41:49.186 --> 00:41:49.987
right? So let me

1824
00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:51.168
showcase that prompt. And

1825
00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:51.728
this is the big

1826
00:41:51.768 --> 00:41:53.009
advantage you get when

1827
00:41:53.009 --> 00:41:54.289
you start specializing your

1828
00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:55.451
agents. You can build

1829
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.773
custom prompts that only

1830
00:41:57.913 --> 00:41:58.893
they can run. And

1831
00:41:58.893 --> 00:42:00.233
this should sound familiar
