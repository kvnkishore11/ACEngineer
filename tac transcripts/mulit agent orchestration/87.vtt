1904
00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:30.371
of nowhere with our

1905
00:43:30.612 --> 00:43:33.155
orchestrator agent, powerful primary

1906
00:43:33.295 --> 00:43:34.036
agents that we can

1907
00:43:34.175 --> 00:43:35.436
operate on, and then

1908
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:36.478
our work can be

1909
00:43:36.557 --> 00:43:37.338
passed off to the

1910
00:43:37.378 --> 00:43:38.219
next agent, and then

1911
00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:38.880
the next, and then

1912
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.081
the next. Look at

1913
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:42.443
this, planning took 21,000

1914
00:43:42.443 --> 00:43:43.425
tokens. This is a

1915
00:43:43.585 --> 00:43:45.367
relatively small codebase.

1916
00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:46.387
If this is larger,

1917
00:43:48.148 --> 00:43:48.784
2X, 3X, 5X the

1918
00:43:48.784 --> 00:43:49.650
size, you can see

1919
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:50.652
this going up. We

1920
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:52.614
are constantly solving the

1921
00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:54.577
context management problem with

1922
00:43:54.617 --> 00:43:56.239
multi-agent orchestration. We have

1923
00:43:56.239 --> 00:43:57.059
a planner, we then

1924
00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:57.659
pass it off to

1925
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.902
our builder and then

1926
00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:00.384
our builder is going
