millions of tokens, scaling

29
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.418
as your codebase grows.

30
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:03.598
This lesson is about

31
00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:06.159
flipping that equation. Here,

32
00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.998
we master custom agents

33
00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:09.337
so your compute works

34
00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:10.837
for your domain, your

35
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.296
problems, your edge cases.

36
00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:14.475
This is where all

37
00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:15.674
the alpha is in

38
00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:16.713
engineering. It's in the

39
00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:18.873
hard specific problems that

40
00:01:18.873 --> 00:01:20.510
most engineers and most

41
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.689
agents can't solve out

42
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:23.748
of the box. You

43
00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:24.847
can't walk up to

44
00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:26.027
these problems and solve

45
00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:28.245
them without unique domain

46
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.284
knowledge. And custom agents
