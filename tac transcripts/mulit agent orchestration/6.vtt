105
00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:01.437
far beyond the rest.

106
00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.197
As usual, we're gonna

107
00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:07.936
start simple and progress

108
00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:09.713
through more capable agents

109
00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:11.033
step-by-step so you can

110
00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.912
understand how to build

111
00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:14.350
these from zero. In

112
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.810
the building specialized agents

113
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.989
codebase, inside of

114
00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:18.108
apps, you can see

115
00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:19.727
eight custom agents. We're

116
00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:20.626
gonna break down. Some

117
00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:21.664
of these have multiple

118
00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.264
agents embedded within each.

119
00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:24.622
Let's start simple with

120
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:30.701
the Pong agent. So
