863
00:20:29.413 --> 00:20:30.713
tactic to push what

864
00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:31.875
you can do further.

865
00:20:31.934 --> 00:20:32.256
You know, let me

866
00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:33.175
be clear, I'm super

867
00:20:33.195 --> 00:20:35.057
excited for larger effective

868
00:20:35.097 --> 00:20:36.910
context windows, but 200K

869
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.520
context window is plenty.

870
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.142
You're just stuffing a

871
00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:41.403
single agent with too

872
00:20:41.442 --> 00:20:42.845
much work, just like

873
00:20:42.924 --> 00:20:43.625
your boss did to

874
00:20:43.684 --> 00:20:44.346
you at your last

875
00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.247
job. Okay. Don't force

876
00:20:46.267 --> 00:20:47.167
your agent to context

877
00:20:47.167 --> 00:20:48.108
switch. You know what

878
00:20:48.128 --> 00:20:49.250
that feels like. Force

879
00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:50.431
it to focus and

880
00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:51.011
then let it go

881
00:20:51.211 --> 00:20:52.313
home back to the

882
00:20:52.373 --> 00:20:53.854
data center. Delete it.

883
00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:55.390
So very powerful stuff,

884
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.490
right? We're gonna clear

885
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.711
our logs here. Our

886
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.872
orchestrator agent is just

887
00:20:59.011 --> 00:21:00.132
ready and waiting. It
