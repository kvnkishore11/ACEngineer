732
00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:30.310
done. It's important that

733
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:31.672
our orchestrator agent can

734
00:17:31.711 --> 00:17:33.053
tap into each agent

735
00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:33.732
when it needs to

736
00:17:33.873 --> 00:17:35.153
command them, read from

737
00:17:35.173 --> 00:17:36.414
them. But again, we

738
00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:37.576
don't want our orchestrator

739
00:17:37.675 --> 00:17:39.116
agent getting involved in

740
00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:40.458
the actual work. It

741
00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:41.878
is just here to

742
00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:43.200
orchestrate. This is our

743
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.621
single interface into multi-agent

744
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:47.162
orchestration. Let's look at

745
00:17:47.303 --> 00:17:48.983
our front end summary.

746
00:17:49.044 --> 00:17:49.344
So if we just

747
00:17:49.364 --> 00:17:50.484
click into this, we

748
00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:51.945
should see a front

749
00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.146
end key nodes. So

750
00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:53.707
check this out. We

751
00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:54.708
have our key components.

752
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:55.928
We have our composables,

753
00:17:56.088 --> 00:17:56.949
we have our services,

754
00:17:57.028 --> 00:17:58.109
and we have our

755
00:17:58.281 --> 00:17:59.903
core files. So this

756
00:17:59.943 --> 00:18:00.484
is great, right? We
