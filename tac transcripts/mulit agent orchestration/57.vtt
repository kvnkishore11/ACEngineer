1220
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:30.634
can be handed off,

1221
00:28:30.795 --> 00:28:32.276
inspected, review, so on

1222
00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:32.816
and so forth. This

1223
00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:33.675
is a key pattern

1224
00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:35.715
for multi-agent orchestration. Every

1225
00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:37.636
agent should produce some

1226
00:28:37.696 --> 00:28:39.737
concrete result. Okay, otherwise,

1227
00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:40.656
what was the point

1228
00:28:40.696 --> 00:28:41.596
in the first place?

1229
00:28:41.696 --> 00:28:42.258
Okay, so we see

1230
00:28:42.357 --> 00:28:43.218
in the executive summary

1231
00:28:43.278 --> 00:28:44.538
here, it searches across

1232
00:28:44.538 --> 00:28:46.018
10 primary fields, six

1233
00:28:46.117 --> 00:28:47.858
categories, and there it

1234
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:48.459
is, right? So we

1235
00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:49.519
can just quickly see

1236
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.078
that. And of course,

1237
00:28:50.118 --> 00:28:50.719
we can use this,

1238
00:28:50.778 --> 00:28:51.419
right? This is this

1239
00:28:51.499 --> 00:28:52.299
field here. If you

1240
00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:53.635
type in using tool,

1241
00:28:53.635 --> 00:28:55.340
you can see all

1242
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.181
of our using tool

1243
00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:56.882
calls. If we type

1244
00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:58.262
in pre-tool use, you

1245
00:28:58.262 --> 00:28:59.064
can see we're filtering

1246
00:28:59.084 --> 00:29:00.444
on that now. Regex,
