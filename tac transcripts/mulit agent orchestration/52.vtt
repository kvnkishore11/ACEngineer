1116
00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:00.982
us get there. It's

1117
00:26:01.002 --> 00:26:02.143
helping us push this

1118
00:26:02.222 --> 00:26:03.324
forward. We have hooks,

1119
00:26:03.644 --> 00:26:04.604
we have prompts, we

1120
00:26:04.624 --> 00:26:05.723
have access to every

1121
00:26:05.804 --> 00:26:06.845
Claude Code feature we

1122
00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:08.204
want. We've got better

1123
00:26:08.305 --> 00:26:09.505
agents, we've got more

1124
00:26:09.645 --> 00:26:10.705
agents, and they're all

1125
00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:12.026
commanded by our O

1126
00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:13.987
agent, our orchestrator agent.

1127
00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:15.807
So we're missing one

1128
00:26:16.027 --> 00:26:17.167
big piece here, one

1129
00:26:17.407 --> 00:26:19.607
huge idea. What about

1130
00:26:19.728 --> 00:26:23.249
custom agents? Let's go

1131
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:24.569
ahead and reset, delete

1132
00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:25.945
agent. There's only one

1133
00:26:25.986 --> 00:26:26.527
agent that's going to

1134
00:26:26.527 --> 00:26:27.507
know exactly what that

1135
00:26:27.547 --> 00:26:28.788
means. So let's go

1136
00:26:28.808 --> 00:26:29.388
ahead and go back

1137
00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:30.769
to auto-file mode and
