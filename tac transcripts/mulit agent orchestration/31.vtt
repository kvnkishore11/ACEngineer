637
00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.676
agents. Okay. And so

638
00:15:30.775 --> 00:15:31.416
you can see here

639
00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:32.855
the orchestrator agent, you

640
00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:34.355
know, ran some specialized

641
00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.177
tools to actually check

642
00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:37.437
the status of every

643
00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:38.397
agent. Check this out,

644
00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:39.437
right? Agent name. And

645
00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:39.957
we're going to expand

646
00:15:39.957 --> 00:15:40.357
this a little bit

647
00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:41.953
here. Agent name. tail,

648
00:15:42.394 --> 00:15:43.897
agent name, tail. It

649
00:15:43.937 --> 00:15:45.359
is actually looking at

650
00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:47.120
the response logs here

651
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.201
and then it's communicating

652
00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:49.342
to us, all right?

653
00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:51.505
So this single interface

654
00:15:51.546 --> 00:15:53.548
pattern is very important

655
00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:55.051
here for orchestrating agents

656
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.773
at scale. We're protecting

657
00:15:56.812 --> 00:15:58.214
context windows, We have

658
00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:01.155
specialized, dedicated, focused agents,
