48
00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:30.853
you will hit a

49
00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:32.256
wall. There are hard

50
00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:33.677
limits on the current

51
00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:35.638
interface of agents. You

52
00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:37.260
can't scale by hopping

53
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.540
into one terminal at

54
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.081
a time, writing one

55
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.123
prompt at a time.

56
00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:42.664
As a tactical agentic

57
00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:44.004
coding member, you know

58
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:45.126
the solution to this.

59
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.346
Build a layer of

60
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.009
agents around your code

61
00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:50.611
base with repeatable workflows

62
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.753
using AI developer workflows

63
00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:54.573
and leverage points of

64
00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:56.236
agentic coding. But as

65
00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.397
powerful as this is,

66
00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.817
there's an upfront investment

67
00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.599
we need to all

68
00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:01.099
pay down to build
