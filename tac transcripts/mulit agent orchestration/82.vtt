1779
00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:01.246
all here. Our orchestrator

1780
00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:02.027
is going to clean

1781
00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:02.827
up these agents for

1782
00:41:02.909 --> 00:41:03.608
us. There we go.

1783
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.931
Command K, paste. This

1784
00:41:05.971 --> 00:41:06.632
is the last prompt

1785
00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:07.532
I'm gonna showcase to

1786
00:41:07.592 --> 00:41:08.173
you. Here we're gonna

1787
00:41:08.173 --> 00:41:08.693
do something a little

1788
00:41:08.713 --> 00:41:09.894
more complex, some more

1789
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:11.076
UI changes. We want

1790
00:41:11.115 --> 00:41:11.976
our agent list to

1791
00:41:12.016 --> 00:41:13.137
collapse and we wanna

1792
00:41:13.197 --> 00:41:14.298
update our orchestrator chat

1793
00:41:14.318 --> 00:41:15.019
to go into small

1794
00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:16.460
mode when browser width

1795
00:41:16.862 --> 00:41:18.664
is less than 650.

1796
00:41:18.664 --> 00:41:19.384
We'll just be super

1797
00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:20.284
clear here and say

1798
00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:21.606
less than. Okay, we're

1799
00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:22.367
gonna kick this off.

1800
00:41:22.467 --> 00:41:22.907
And this is of

1801
00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.568
course going to fire

1802
00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:25.469
off an agentic prompt

1803
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.612
designed for our orchestrator.

1804
00:41:27.713 --> 00:41:28.273
This is something that

1805
00:41:28.313 --> 00:41:29.094
a lot of engineers

1806
00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:30.635
don't realize. Once you
