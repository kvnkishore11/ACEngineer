1046
00:24:29.762 --> 00:24:31.403
here, just a simple

1047
00:24:31.423 --> 00:24:32.663
prime command. We're setting

1048
00:24:32.682 --> 00:24:33.423
things up, read some

1049
00:24:33.443 --> 00:24:34.832
essential files, or you

1050
00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:35.503
can set up more

1051
00:24:35.523 --> 00:24:36.984
more important, more specific

1052
00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:38.286
prime commands like this,

1053
00:24:38.365 --> 00:24:40.047
right? Where you're specializing

1054
00:24:40.086 --> 00:24:41.307
the files, okay? Hopping

1055
00:24:41.307 --> 00:24:42.048
back outside the loop

1056
00:24:42.068 --> 00:24:43.269
here, your agent can

1057
00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:44.590
just run these, right?

1058
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.892
Both the orchestrator and

1059
00:24:45.892 --> 00:24:47.212
of course our primary

1060
00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:48.173
agents, right? And our

1061
00:24:48.272 --> 00:24:49.233
agent bank. And so

1062
00:24:49.314 --> 00:24:49.815
you can see there,

1063
00:24:49.994 --> 00:24:50.734
it's just reading these

1064
00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:51.875
files. You're not going

1065
00:24:51.895 --> 00:24:52.777
to always want to

1066
00:24:52.817 --> 00:24:53.676
do this, but a

1067
00:24:53.777 --> 00:24:54.678
prime command is of

1068
00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:56.118
course gonna be useful

1069
00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:57.599
for your orchestrator agent

1070
00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.020
to give it a

1071
00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.642
high level understanding of

1072
00:24:59.682 --> 00:25:00.722
the codebase. But
