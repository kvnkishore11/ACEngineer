502
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.283
not yours. When you

503
00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:32.203
build something like this,

504
00:12:32.344 --> 00:12:34.047
you get specialization all

505
00:12:34.307 --> 00:12:35.668
the way down. It's

506
00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:36.610
super important to note,

507
00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:38.091
I have this deployed

508
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:39.855
for several codebases

509
00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:42.238
I can access anywhere,

510
00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:44.258
anytime, through multiple devices.

511
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:45.458
And it's all because

512
00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.658
it's designed as an

513
00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:48.519
Outloop system. This is

514
00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:49.739
a critical component of

515
00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:50.679
the system to mention,

516
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.360
all right? So we

517
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.919
have a bunch of

518
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.200
additional documentation here. You

519
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.460
can see this agent

520
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.240
did a really great

521
00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.941
job of summarizing everything

522
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.821
going on. There's the

523
00:12:57.961 --> 00:12:59.541
table structure, and this

524
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:00.000
is all gonna be
