00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:01.724
orchestrator involved in this

1454
00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:03.306
process. We're spinning up

1455
00:34:03.385 --> 00:34:04.527
a small team of

1456
00:34:04.647 --> 00:34:05.508
agents to accomplish a

1457
00:34:05.587 --> 00:34:07.529
task. Each context window,

1458
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.971
each task of our

1459
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.612
agent is going to

1460
00:34:09.612 --> 00:34:10.632
be focused. And you

1461
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:11.594
can see here, this

1462
00:34:11.673 --> 00:34:13.876
prompt has triggered orchestrator

1463
00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:15.516
thinking. Okay, our orchestrator

1464
00:34:15.577 --> 00:34:16.637
is now thinking and

1465
00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:17.838
now it's running a

1466
00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:19.099
workflow. So there we

1467
00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:19.820
go. We have our

1468
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:21.581
scout header and we're

1469
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:22.943
going to have our,

1470
00:34:23.164 --> 00:34:23.463
you can see we're

1471
00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:24.045
going to create two

1472
00:34:24.164 --> 00:34:26.077
agents here, scout, and

1473
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:27.438
our builder. So there's

1474
00:34:27.478 --> 00:34:28.438
our builder, there's our

1475
00:34:28.498 --> 00:34:29.978
scout and our scout
