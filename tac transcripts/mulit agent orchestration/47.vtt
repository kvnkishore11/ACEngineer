999
00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:30.930
into reusable prompts and

1000
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.692
we've taught our orchestrator

1001
00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:34.013
agent. Once again, we've

1002
00:23:34.153 --> 00:23:35.977
templated our engineering into

1003
00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:37.338
our orchestrator agent so

1004
00:23:37.378 --> 00:23:38.661
that it knows how

1005
00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:40.527
to run custom slash

1006
00:23:40.547 --> 00:23:42.368
commands for our other

1007
00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:43.790
agents, all right? Super

1008
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.811
powerful, it's done already.

1009
00:23:44.892 --> 00:23:45.553
It's found the answer,

1010
00:23:45.712 --> 00:23:47.295
right? 20K context, one

1011
00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:48.096
cent, we have the

1012
00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.198
answer here. The answer

1013
00:23:49.238 --> 00:23:50.479
is yes, orchestrator and

1014
00:23:50.538 --> 00:23:51.881
agents can use skills.

1015
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.942
It's telling us where

1016
00:23:53.163 --> 00:23:53.863
you can even see

1017
00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:55.465
it's consumed files, where

1018
00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:56.346
and how they figure

1019
00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:57.768
that out. Fantastic, right?

1020
00:23:57.868 --> 00:23:59.369
We are directly tapping

1021
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.173
into a great agent
