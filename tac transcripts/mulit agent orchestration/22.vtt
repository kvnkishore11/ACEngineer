435
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.460
how pluggable the Cloud

436
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.000
Code ecosystem is. So

437
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.799
we have our AI

438
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.880
pieces here. The most

439
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.561
important thing here is

440
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.880
that we have separated

441
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.441
our orchestrator agent from

442
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.402
our command level agents.

443
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.621
All right, we also

444
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:12.461
have, this is super

445
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:13.422
important as well, we

446
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:14.863
have a data layer.

447
00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:16.043
Everything we're doing here

448
00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:17.682
is operating and firing

449
00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:20.063
into a Postgres database

450
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:22.485
with concrete structure. Why

451
00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.206
is that? Why haven't

452
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.447
made that architectural decision?

453
00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:27.408
It's because this system

454
00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:28.328
is in fact an

455
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.591
Outloop Peter system. We
