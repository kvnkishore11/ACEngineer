2374
00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:30.530
I'll let the ecosystem

2375
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.452
of great engineers that

2376
00:53:32.472 --> 00:53:33.653
are watching and viewing

2377
00:53:33.673 --> 00:53:34.554
this. I'll let you

2378
00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:35.856
make your concrete vote

2379
00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:36.438
so that I know

2380
00:53:36.478 --> 00:53:37.360
exactly what you're looking

2381
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:37.800
for. We're going to

2382
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.300
have a lot of

2383
00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.822
great overlap. I digress.

2384
00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.545
ADW plugs into this

2385
00:53:41.626 --> 00:53:43.528
workflow perfectly. I already

2386
00:53:43.548 --> 00:53:44.369
have mocks and I

2387
00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:45.632
already have agents building

2388
00:53:45.652 --> 00:53:46.313
a version of that.

2389
00:53:46.313 --> 00:53:47.173
More on that. in

2390
00:53:47.193 --> 00:53:48.173
the future. I'm not

2391
00:53:48.213 --> 00:53:48.873
just trying to sell

2392
00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:50.355
you some fake, unrealistic

2393
00:53:50.414 --> 00:53:51.974
vision of a perfect

2394
00:53:52.155 --> 00:53:53.414
out loop agent decoding

2395
00:53:53.474 --> 00:53:55.275
system with ADWs running

2396
00:53:55.315 --> 00:53:56.235
left and right, doing

2397
00:53:56.255 --> 00:53:56.795
all your work for

2398
00:53:56.856 --> 00:53:57.635
you, right? We have

2399
00:53:57.655 --> 00:53:58.615
to be realistic, right?

2400
00:53:58.795 --> 00:53:59.835
Engineering happens in the

2401
00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.737
gray. It happens in
