31
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.143
one mode of engineering

32
00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:02.503
that matters above all

33
00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:05.685
now, agentic engineering. Here,

34
00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:06.805
we don't focus on

35
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.478
the application layer, we

36
00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.106
focus on the agentic

37
00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:11.209
layer. We build the

38
00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:12.971
system that builds the

39
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.433
system. If you're watching

40
00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:15.953
this, you've been scaling

41
00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.096
up your agentic engineering.

42
00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:19.578
You've got better agents,

43
00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:21.421
you're running more agents,

44
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.501
and maybe you've built

45
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:25.689
custom agents specialized for

46
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.471
your domain-specific problems. But

47
00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:29.593
if you haven't yet,

48
00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:30.853
you will hit a
