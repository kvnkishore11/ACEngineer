1093
00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:30.165
code and the agent

1094
00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:31.688
SDK and the ecosystem

1095
00:25:31.807 --> 00:25:33.429
is far ahead of

1096
00:25:33.469 --> 00:25:34.430
the pack. It's not

1097
00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:35.391
just about the agent

1098
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:36.571
loop or the model.

1099
00:25:36.612 --> 00:25:37.873
It's about the ecosystem

1100
00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:39.213
that lets you build

1101
00:25:39.515 --> 00:25:40.375
the way you need

1102
00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:42.277
to, to solve your

1103
00:25:42.376 --> 00:25:44.298
problems at scale. Okay.

1104
00:25:44.499 --> 00:25:45.680
In tactical agent decoding,

1105
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.901
we break down moving

1106
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.182
from in the loop

1107
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:49.083
to out the loop,

1108
00:25:49.262 --> 00:25:49.763
all the way to

1109
00:25:49.963 --> 00:25:51.484
ZTE, where we can

1110
00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:52.546
put agents to work

1111
00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:54.067
at scale. The O

1112
00:25:54.307 --> 00:25:55.388
agent is a key

1113
00:25:55.608 --> 00:25:56.990
step in that transition.

1114
00:25:57.162 --> 00:25:57.902
And the Cloud Agent

1115
00:25:58.021 --> 00:25:59.722
SDK tooling is helping

1116
00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:00.982
us get there. It's
