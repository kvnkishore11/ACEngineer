2350
00:52:59.257 --> 00:53:01.199
developer workflows. Okay. This

2351
00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:01.721
is the big missing

2352
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.681
piece. And this is

2353
00:53:02.701 --> 00:53:03.442
something that we will

2354
00:53:03.461 --> 00:53:04.342
be building and I

2355
00:53:04.362 --> 00:53:05.744
will be showcasing in

2356
00:53:05.844 --> 00:53:07.806
upcoming agentic horizon lessons.

2357
00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:08.385
It's going to fit

2358
00:53:08.425 --> 00:53:09.606
in very well with

2359
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:10.949
the voting. Thank you

2360
00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:11.909
for placing your votes.

2361
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.010
That information has been

2362
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:14.391
really great for guiding

2363
00:53:14.731 --> 00:53:15.833
upcoming lessons. I think

2364
00:53:16.012 --> 00:53:16.994
if I do another

2365
00:53:17.293 --> 00:53:18.635
large heavy hitting course

2366
00:53:18.675 --> 00:53:19.576
like this, who knows

2367
00:53:19.615 --> 00:53:20.217
if I will, but

2368
00:53:20.317 --> 00:53:20.836
if I end up

2369
00:53:20.896 --> 00:53:22.038
doing another one, I

2370
00:53:22.057 --> 00:53:24.079
will definitely incorporate your

2371
00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:26.182
your word, your ideas

2372
00:53:26.443 --> 00:53:28.045
into upcoming lessons. I'll

2373
00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:29.126
ship some lessons and

2374
00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:30.530
I'll let the ecosystem
