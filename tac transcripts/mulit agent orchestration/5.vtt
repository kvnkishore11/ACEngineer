84
00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:30.971
make a few tweaks

85
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.931
so that it performs

86
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:33.210
better for your use

87
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.469
case. You don't always

88
00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.628
have to reinvent the

89
00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:37.147
agent from zero. In

90
00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:38.367
this advanced lesson and

91
00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:40.507
we showcase eight unique

92
00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.425
custom agents built on

93
00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:44.205
the Claude Code SDK,

94
00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:45.384
each one showing you

95
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:47.003
how to deploy across

96
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:48.723
your stack, products, and

97
00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:50.961
engineering lifecycle. The agents

98
00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:52.342
are on the horizon.

99
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.741
It's time to master

100
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:54.980
agents by going all

101
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.381
the way to the

102
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.400
bare metal, to the

103
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.680
custom agent, so you

104
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.038
can scale your compute

105
00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:01.437
far beyond the rest.
