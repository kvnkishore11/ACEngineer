571
00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.288
agents at scale. Okay,

572
00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:00.909
so we can prompt

573
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.490
something like this. List

574
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:04.572
agents and then check

575
00:14:04.993 --> 00:14:07.241
the status of our

576
00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:08.261
agents, okay? And so

577
00:14:08.322 --> 00:14:08.741
this is going to

578
00:14:08.822 --> 00:14:10.283
kick off our orchestrator

579
00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:11.403
agent once again and

580
00:14:11.442 --> 00:14:13.342
have it actually understand

581
00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:14.322
the work that was

582
00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:15.403
done. Now, this is

583
00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:16.744
super important. Our orchestrator

584
00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.144
agent is not always

585
00:14:18.344 --> 00:14:19.644
looking at the results,

586
00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:20.804
right? I mean, look

587
00:14:20.845 --> 00:14:21.524
at what just happened

588
00:14:21.524 --> 00:14:22.625
there between all these

589
00:14:22.705 --> 00:14:24.806
agents. It's incredibly overwhelming.

590
00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:26.326
There's too much information,

591
00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:27.466
okay? And so what

592
00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:28.265
we've done here with

593
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.426
our orchestrator agent is

594
00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:30.626
that we've designed it
