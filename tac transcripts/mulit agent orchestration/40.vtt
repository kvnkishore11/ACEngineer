842
00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.708
of the Elite Context

843
00:20:00.728 --> 00:20:02.587
Engineering Agentic Horizon lesson.

844
00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:04.009
We are reducing and

845
00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:06.109
delegating context to the

846
00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:07.653
max, okay? By the

847
00:20:07.693 --> 00:20:08.315
way, if you haven't

848
00:20:08.335 --> 00:20:09.935
completed Tactical Agentic Coding

849
00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:11.356
and the previous Agentic

850
00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:13.038
Corizon lessons, stop this

851
00:20:13.098 --> 00:20:14.519
video, go watch those.

852
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.361
All of this will

853
00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:15.820
make a lot more

854
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:17.282
sense. We are compounding

855
00:20:17.323 --> 00:20:19.084
our engineering with tactics

856
00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:20.545
of agentic coding and

857
00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:22.586
powerful patterns over and

858
00:20:22.646 --> 00:20:24.108
over and over. Okay,

859
00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:25.769
every single lesson matters.

860
00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:26.510
Every single lesson was

861
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.811
designed to have a

862
00:20:27.912 --> 00:20:29.333
critical idea, a critical

863
00:20:29.413 --> 00:20:30.713
tactic to push what
