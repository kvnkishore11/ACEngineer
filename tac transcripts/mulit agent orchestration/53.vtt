00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:30.769
to auto-file mode and

1138
00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:33.271
let's talk about specialized

1139
00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:35.433
agents. Our previous agentic

1140
00:26:35.453 --> 00:26:36.934
horizon lesson was all

1141
00:26:37.134 --> 00:26:39.256
about custom agents. So

1142
00:26:39.696 --> 00:26:41.337
can our orchestrator agent

1143
00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:43.400
incorporate that functionality? Of

1144
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.980
course it can. It

1145
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.761
can do anything we

1146
00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:47.603
teach it to do.

1147
00:26:47.903 --> 00:26:48.482
If we had command

1148
00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:49.304
K here, you'll see

1149
00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:50.825
something interesting. We have

1150
00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:52.097
slash commands, We of

1151
00:26:52.137 --> 00:26:53.398
course have our orchestrator

1152
00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:54.359
tools here that we've

1153
00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.220
been using and we

1154
00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:57.382
have agent templates. Let's

1155
00:26:57.442 --> 00:26:58.923
create a new agent

1156
00:26:59.222 --> 00:27:01.064
that is specialized. Create
