1500
00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:01.985
creating useful information sets,

1501
00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:02.525
and they're going to

1502
00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.648
pass that off to

1503
00:35:03.708 --> 00:35:05.469
the next agent. Okay.

1504
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.632
So we're talking plans,

1505
00:35:06.632 --> 00:35:07.492
we're talking logs, we're

1506
00:35:07.512 --> 00:35:08.934
talking results, we're talking

1507
00:35:08.954 --> 00:35:10.255
documentation, and then our

1508
00:35:10.356 --> 00:35:11.518
orchestrator chains it all

1509
00:35:11.557 --> 00:35:12.518
together. Look at what

1510
00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:13.639
our orchestrator is doing

1511
00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:14.501
here. It is actually

1512
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:16.244
involved in this process.

1513
00:35:16.563 --> 00:35:17.686
Okay. So our orchestrator

1514
00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:19.166
is in a loop

1515
00:35:19.447 --> 00:35:20.728
sleeping. You've probably seen

1516
00:35:20.768 --> 00:35:21.990
this pattern. Your primary

1517
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.512
agent will sleep, fire

1518
00:35:23.552 --> 00:35:24.353
off some other agents

1519
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:25.014
to do some work,

1520
00:35:25.114 --> 00:35:25.856
and then it'll check

1521
00:35:25.896 --> 00:35:26.663
in on that. Right.

1522
00:35:26.663 --> 00:35:27.677
So this is a,

1523
00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:29.690
common agent decoding pattern

1524
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:30.570
you can use. And
