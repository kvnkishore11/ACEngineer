1687
00:38:57.818 --> 00:39:00.141
something went wrong, I

1688
00:39:00.141 --> 00:39:01.121
could dial in right

1689
00:39:01.202 --> 00:39:02.702
here and understand why,

1690
00:39:03.081 --> 00:39:03.882
when and where and

1691
00:39:04.043 --> 00:39:05.342
who, right? What agent

1692
00:39:05.382 --> 00:39:06.123
messed up? Was it

1693
00:39:06.163 --> 00:39:07.063
our planner? Was it

1694
00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:08.204
our builder? Was it

1695
00:39:08.224 --> 00:39:09.284
the other agents in

1696
00:39:09.304 --> 00:39:10.684
this pipeline? I wanna

1697
00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:12.684
keep these examples concise

1698
00:39:12.724 --> 00:39:13.465
for you, but when

1699
00:39:13.545 --> 00:39:14.385
I'm working on this,

1700
00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:15.784
when I'm deploying agents

1701
00:39:15.824 --> 00:39:16.885
at scale, I'll have

1702
00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:18.465
five to 10. One

1703
00:39:18.485 --> 00:39:19.985
time I had 16

1704
00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:21.945
agents operating, completing work

1705
00:39:22.005 --> 00:39:24.586
at absurd scales, absurd

1706
00:39:24.686 --> 00:39:27.726
scales, okay? And there

1707
00:39:27.746 --> 00:39:28.748
are levels to this

1708
00:39:28.847 --> 00:39:29.807
game, okay? And I

1709
00:39:29.807 --> 00:39:30.608
just wanna show you
