2052
00:46:29.635 --> 00:46:30.396
and forth, back and

2053
00:46:30.396 --> 00:46:31.097
forth. You know how

2054
00:46:31.117 --> 00:46:32.297
that goes, okay? You've

2055
00:46:32.318 --> 00:46:33.059
seen that, we're gonna

2056
00:46:33.139 --> 00:46:34.280
watch this evolve. What

2057
00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:34.960
I wanna do here

2058
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:36.463
is just communicate to

2059
00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:38.746
you the next paradigm

2060
00:46:38.786 --> 00:46:39.666
of engineering so that

2061
00:46:39.927 --> 00:46:40.568
if you want to,

2062
00:46:40.668 --> 00:46:41.349
you can get ahead,

2063
00:46:41.389 --> 00:46:41.949
you can push your

2064
00:46:41.969 --> 00:46:43.070
engineering. And at the

2065
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:44.293
very least, you can

2066
00:46:44.393 --> 00:46:45.014
take some of these

2067
00:46:45.114 --> 00:46:46.474
ideas and roll it

2068
00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:47.757
into your own work.

2069
00:46:48.117 --> 00:46:49.318
Even without the orchestrator,

2070
00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:50.780
when you're operating in

2071
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.822
the loop with your

2072
00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:53.724
basic agent, your basic

2073
00:46:53.965 --> 00:46:55.266
codex, Claude Code, Gemini

2074
00:46:55.286 --> 00:46:56.367
CLI, whatever agent you

2075
00:46:56.387 --> 00:46:57.324
like to use, you

2076
00:46:57.324 --> 00:46:58.762
can build out more

2077
00:46:58.862 --> 00:47:00.643
powerful workflows than you
