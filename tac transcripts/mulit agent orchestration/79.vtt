1709
00:39:29.807 --> 00:39:30.608
just wanna show you

1710
00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:32.411
maximum potential. I'm gonna

1711
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:32.851
show you what you

1712
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.293
can really do if

1713
00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:35.516
you invest in the

1714
00:39:35.577 --> 00:39:36.978
agentic layer, right? Make

1715
00:39:37.018 --> 00:39:38.581
no mistake, the multi-agent

1716
00:39:38.641 --> 00:39:40.684
orchestration, your O-agent, it

1717
00:39:40.684 --> 00:39:42.139
is a part of

1718
00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:43.719
your agentic layer. In

1719
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.061
fact, it is the

1720
00:39:45.181 --> 00:39:46.523
key to unlocking how

1721
00:39:46.543 --> 00:39:48.684
to best organize, create,

1722
00:39:49.065 --> 00:39:50.786
and use your agentic

1723
00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:51.746
layer. We don't have

1724
00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:52.588
time for that here,

1725
00:39:52.748 --> 00:39:53.248
but we are going

1726
00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:54.208
to be diving into

1727
00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:56.952
scaling multi-agent orchestration and

1728
00:39:57.012 --> 00:39:58.373
connecting it to your

1729
00:39:58.552 --> 00:40:00.255
AI developer workflows and
