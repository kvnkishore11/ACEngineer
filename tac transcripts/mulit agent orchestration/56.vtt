1196
00:27:59.394 --> 00:28:00.094
done here. This is

1197
00:28:00.134 --> 00:28:01.576
what sub-agents are. We've

1198
00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:02.576
just pulled it up

1199
00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:03.297
a level. We want

1200
00:28:03.297 --> 00:28:03.676
it to be a

1201
00:28:03.797 --> 00:28:05.259
primary agent that our

1202
00:28:05.398 --> 00:28:07.039
orchestrator agent can conduct.

1203
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.201
You can't do all

1204
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.182
this with a sub-agent.

1205
00:28:10.242 --> 00:28:11.564
You're locked in, it's

1206
00:28:11.703 --> 00:28:12.944
too narrow. By adding

1207
00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:14.726
an additional level of

1208
00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:15.707
agents, we can do

1209
00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:16.707
a lot more. It's

1210
00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:18.387
a lot more controllable,

1211
00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:20.648
okay? 6K context, there's

1212
00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:21.368
all the tool calls,

1213
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:22.229
there's a cost, there's

1214
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:23.170
a model, and there

1215
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.903
we go, we have

1216
00:28:23.903 --> 00:28:25.614
a produced document, this

1217
00:28:25.653 --> 00:28:26.854
pattern is super important.

1218
00:28:26.974 --> 00:28:28.154
Our agents are always

1219
00:28:28.234 --> 00:28:29.714
producing a document that

1220
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:30.634
can be handed off,
