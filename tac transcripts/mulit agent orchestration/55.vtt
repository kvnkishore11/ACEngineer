00:27:29.366 --> 00:27:30.107
What is this template?

1177
00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:30.748
It is of course

1178
00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:32.769
a custom agent and

1179
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:34.010
it's coming right from

1180
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.432
our agents directory. If

1181
00:27:35.451 --> 00:27:37.353
we type agents slash

1182
00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:39.934
scout fast, check this

1183
00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:41.455
out. We are in

1184
00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:44.317
the Claude agents subdirectory.

1185
00:27:44.922 --> 00:27:45.823
We are stacking up

1186
00:27:46.042 --> 00:27:48.144
on this powerful ecosystem

1187
00:27:48.164 --> 00:27:49.705
that already exists. Instead

1188
00:27:49.705 --> 00:27:50.247
of just using a

1189
00:27:50.406 --> 00:27:51.647
sub-agent here, we can

1190
00:27:51.708 --> 00:27:52.689
turn this into a

1191
00:27:53.108 --> 00:27:54.990
full-on primary agent by

1192
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:56.471
blowing away the system

1193
00:27:56.531 --> 00:27:57.251
prompt and by giving

1194
00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:58.333
it custom tools. That

1195
00:27:58.373 --> 00:27:59.374
is exactly what we've

1196
00:27:59.394 --> 00:28:00.094
done here. This is
