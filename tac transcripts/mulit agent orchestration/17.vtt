WEBVTT

323
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:30.612
completed. It has created

324
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.735
and commanded our agents.

325
00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:33.955
Now our agents are

326
00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.275
doing the work. And

327
00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:35.956
if we dial into

328
00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.256
the individual agent user

329
00:08:37.297 --> 00:08:38.057
interface here, you can

330
00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:38.638
see a couple of

331
00:08:38.738 --> 00:08:40.019
key, key things. We

332
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:40.818
have the name, we

333
00:08:40.818 --> 00:08:41.879
have the status, we

334
00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:42.860
have of course the

335
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.101
context windows. We're managing

336
00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:46.763
the core four of

337
00:08:47.003 --> 00:08:48.323
every single agent we

338
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.445
spin up. If you

339
00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:50.446
do not adopt your

340
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:51.726
agent's perspective, if you

341
00:08:51.746 --> 00:08:52.427
do not know what

342
00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:53.467
they can do, you

343
00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:54.327
do not know what

344
00:08:54.427 --> 00:08:55.168
you can do. We

345
00:08:55.229 --> 00:08:56.830
have our response messages,

346
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.011
we have tool calls

347
00:08:58.192 --> 00:08:58.873
and we have hooks.

348
00:08:59.173 --> 00:08:59.735
And of course we

349
00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:00.975
have reasoning. You can
