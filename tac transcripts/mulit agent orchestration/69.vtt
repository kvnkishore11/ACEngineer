1476
00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:30.559
is going to get

1477
00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:31.579
to work here after

1478
00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.398
our orchestrator kicks it

1479
00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:33.039
off. There we go.

1480
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.780
And you can see

1481
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.599
here again, we're using

1482
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.320
custom agents, okay? Specialized

1483
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.001
custom agents at scale.

1484
00:34:40.141 --> 00:34:40.840
We can spin them

1485
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.880
up and spin them

1486
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.282
down with a single

1487
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.681
prompt, okay? So there

1488
00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:45.362
it is. We're using

1489
00:34:45.422 --> 00:34:46.802
our scout reports just

1490
00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:47.641
fast and then we're

1491
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:48.902
using a build agent,

1492
00:34:48.983 --> 00:34:49.963
okay? Of course, you

1493
00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:50.483
can guess what that

1494
00:34:50.543 --> 00:34:51.802
does. It's focused on

1495
00:34:52.083 --> 00:34:53.123
actually making the code

1496
00:34:53.143 --> 00:34:54.043
changes and making them

1497
00:34:54.043 --> 00:34:56.505
well, okay? powerful example

1498
00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:58.329
of multi-Asian orchestration. We

1499
00:34:58.389 --> 00:34:59.822
have agents doing work,

1500
00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:01.985
creating useful information sets,
