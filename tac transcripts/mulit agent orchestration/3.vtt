46
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.284
knowledge. And custom agents

47
00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:31.783
let you pass your

48
00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:34.296
domain specific unique knowledge

49
00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:35.816
right to your agents.

50
00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:36.775
Custom agents let you

51
00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:38.093
do a few special

52
00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:39.212
things. You can take

53
00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:40.751
the core four context,

54
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:42.549
model, prompt, and tools

55
00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.368
and scale them beyond

56
00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:45.628
the defaults. You can

57
00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:47.686
solve domain specific problems

58
00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:50.424
with targeted repeatable workflows.

59
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.903
Custom agents also let

60
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.093
you protect protect your

61
00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:54.432
codebase, protect your

62
00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:55.891
assets, and protect other

63
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.968
engineers from agents calling

64
00:01:57.968 --> 00:01:59.246
the wrong tools at

65
00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.105
the wrong time. Ultimately,
