00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.737
gray. It happens in

2402
00:54:00.757 --> 00:54:01.996
the messiness of it

2403
00:54:02.056 --> 00:54:03.297
all. There's a progression

2404
00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:04.277
to this. You know,

2405
00:54:04.416 --> 00:54:05.858
with the multi-agent orchestration,

2406
00:54:05.958 --> 00:54:06.777
with the O agent,

2407
00:54:06.978 --> 00:54:08.018
this works in the

2408
00:54:08.077 --> 00:54:09.018
loop and it works

2409
00:54:09.257 --> 00:54:10.079
out the loop. I'm

2410
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:10.998
not trying to just

2411
00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.139
sell you an endpoint,

2412
00:54:12.179 --> 00:54:13.539
an end destination with

2413
00:54:13.559 --> 00:54:14.619
tactical agent decoding and

2414
00:54:14.619 --> 00:54:16.911
agenda horizon. We are

2415
00:54:16.911 --> 00:54:17.039
working step by step

2416
00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.161
to get there. And

2417
00:54:18.201 --> 00:54:19.222
this is a critical

2418
00:54:19.302 --> 00:54:20.664
step. This is agents

2419
00:54:20.903 --> 00:54:22.206
at scale. Once again,

2420
00:54:22.405 --> 00:54:23.827
orchestration agent allows us

2421
00:54:23.867 --> 00:54:25.409
to CRUD agents, which

2422
00:54:25.509 --> 00:54:26.710
lets us have agents

2423
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:27.630
at scale, and then

2424
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:28.952
we observe it. Okay,

2425
00:54:28.992 --> 00:54:30.173
we can quickly observe
