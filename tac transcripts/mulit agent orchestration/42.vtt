WEBVTT

887
00:20:59.011 --> 00:21:00.132
ready and waiting. It

888
00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:01.393
has no agents in

889
00:21:01.413 --> 00:21:02.113
the bank, but it

890
00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:03.354
can create them on

891
00:21:03.413 --> 00:21:04.574
the fly when we

892
00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:05.694
need them to solve

893
00:21:05.775 --> 00:21:07.434
work at scale quickly,

894
00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:08.855
okay? We're not opening

895
00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:09.836
up the terminal. We're

896
00:21:09.855 --> 00:21:10.817
not setting anything up.

897
00:21:10.997 --> 00:21:12.477
Our orchestrator is doing

898
00:21:12.656 --> 00:21:13.538
all of that for

899
00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:14.738
us. We're just talking

900
00:21:15.038 --> 00:21:16.098
to the O agent.

901
00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:17.019
This is a powerful

902
00:21:17.138 --> 00:21:21.381
multi-agent orchestration pattern. Okay,

903
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.101
so how does this

904
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:23.481
work? Let's just take

905
00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:24.377
a step back. and

906
00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:25.519
talk high level, how

907
00:21:25.578 --> 00:21:26.500
does this actually work?

908
00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:27.540
Let me be super

909
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.402
clear about something. The

910
00:21:28.582 --> 00:21:30.403
orchestrator agent is a
