1880
00:42:59.641 --> 00:43:00.782
UI plan, check that

1881
00:43:00.842 --> 00:43:01.543
out. And you can

1882
00:43:01.563 --> 00:43:03.885
imagine that in our

1883
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:04.827
plan prompt, Our agent

1884
00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:05.969
knows how we like

1885
00:43:05.989 --> 00:43:07.090
to plan. We've templated

1886
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.552
our engineering and our

1887
00:43:08.632 --> 00:43:09.353
agent has access to

1888
00:43:09.373 --> 00:43:09.974
that. So if we

1889
00:43:10.014 --> 00:43:10.735
just close this, you

1890
00:43:10.735 --> 00:43:11.215
can see there we

1891
00:43:11.335 --> 00:43:13.137
just passed phase one.

1892
00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:13.998
So that was our

1893
00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:15.722
plan phase. So next,

1894
00:43:15.942 --> 00:43:17.204
our build agent is

1895
00:43:17.224 --> 00:43:17.905
going to spin up

1896
00:43:17.965 --> 00:43:19.005
here and start getting

1897
00:43:19.045 --> 00:43:19.646
to work. This is

1898
00:43:19.686 --> 00:43:20.809
a classic workflow. If

1899
00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:22.231
you're agentic coding, you

1900
00:43:22.411 --> 00:43:23.753
understand what's happening here.

1901
00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:24.974
The big difference is

1902
00:43:25.215 --> 00:43:26.376
we have agents that

1903
00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:27.929
we've spun up out

1904
00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:30.371
of nowhere with our
