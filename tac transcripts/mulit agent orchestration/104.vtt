2308
00:51:58.675 --> 00:52:00.217
engineering tools. Obviously, we're

2309
00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.318
gonna lean super hard

2310
00:52:01.358 --> 00:52:02.800
on the legitimate software

2311
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.161
engineering out of the

2312
00:52:04.262 --> 00:52:05.764
loop agentic coding tools

2313
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.585
like this system, but

2314
00:52:07.606 --> 00:52:08.427
these are coming up.

2315
00:52:08.588 --> 00:52:09.188
We want to have

2316
00:52:09.228 --> 00:52:10.489
a spectrum of tools

2317
00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.690
we can use. More

2318
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.293
specifically, we wanna have

2319
00:52:13.293 --> 00:52:15.536
a dedicated solution for

2320
00:52:15.615 --> 00:52:17.358
solving our domain specific

2321
00:52:17.398 --> 00:52:20.300
problems with our specialized

2322
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:22.402
agents. Okay, this is

2323
00:52:22.664 --> 00:52:24.985
the agentic engineering advantage.

2324
00:52:25.005 --> 00:52:26.027
You can build agents

2325
00:52:26.067 --> 00:52:27.148
that know your problem

2326
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:29.150
better than anyone. Okay,

2327
00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:30.030
better than any cloud
