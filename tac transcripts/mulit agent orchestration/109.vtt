2425
00:54:28.992 --> 00:54:30.173
we can quickly observe

2426
00:54:30.414 --> 00:54:31.255
everything our agents can

2427
00:54:31.295 --> 00:54:32.056
do. And we are,

2428
00:54:32.056 --> 00:54:34.157
of course, being results-oriented.

2429
00:54:34.378 --> 00:54:35.760
Every agent reports a

2430
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.782
concrete result of what

2431
00:54:37.882 --> 00:54:38.782
it just did. The

2432
00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:39.804
orchestrator agent is the

2433
00:54:39.903 --> 00:54:41.126
first pattern where I

2434
00:54:41.246 --> 00:54:43.047
felt the perfect combination

2435
00:54:43.108 --> 00:54:45.309
of observability, customizability, and

2436
00:54:45.489 --> 00:54:46.791
agents at scale. In

2437
00:54:46.791 --> 00:54:47.713
this lesson we spun

2438
00:54:47.773 --> 00:54:49.195
up many, many agents

2439
00:54:49.494 --> 00:54:52.077
with dedicated focus context

2440
00:54:52.478 --> 00:54:54.920
effortlessly. Multi-agent orchestration is

2441
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:55.501
the name of the

2442
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:56.684
game for the next

2443
00:54:56.724 --> 00:54:58.425
level of agentic engineering.

2444
00:54:58.565 --> 00:54:59.586
It's not perfect. There

2445
00:54:59.626 --> 00:55:00.668
are issues, you know,
