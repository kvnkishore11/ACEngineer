1999
00:45:30.007 --> 00:45:31.568
focus on actually getting

2000
00:45:31.588 --> 00:45:32.349
the work done. And

2001
00:45:32.389 --> 00:45:33.431
with this workflow, we

2002
00:45:33.471 --> 00:45:34.032
can do that. And

2003
00:45:34.032 --> 00:45:34.431
then we can have

2004
00:45:34.472 --> 00:45:35.733
a reviewer agent come

2005
00:45:35.793 --> 00:45:36.954
in at the end,

2006
00:45:37.155 --> 00:45:38.135
review the work so

2007
00:45:38.175 --> 00:45:39.471
that we know it's

2008
00:45:39.471 --> 00:45:40.351
done right. I'm not

2009
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:41.010
here to try to

2010
00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.032
sell you some, sell

2011
00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:43.893
you some product, right?

2012
00:45:44.112 --> 00:45:44.594
You're going to have

2013
00:45:44.614 --> 00:45:45.434
this codebase available

2014
00:45:45.474 --> 00:45:46.255
to you. As soon

2015
00:45:46.295 --> 00:45:46.856
as you finish this

2016
00:45:46.916 --> 00:45:47.996
lesson, you can play

2017
00:45:48.056 --> 00:45:48.556
with this. You can

2018
00:45:48.577 --> 00:45:49.217
take it, play with

2019
00:45:49.237 --> 00:45:49.838
it, get it all

2020
00:45:49.938 --> 00:45:50.677
set up. This is

2021
00:45:50.757 --> 00:45:52.179
running on a neon

2022
00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:52.980
database. So if you

2023
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.681
just create a neon

2024
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:54.802
database or a local

2025
00:45:54.882 --> 00:45:56.322
Postgres database with Docker,

2026
00:45:56.362 --> 00:45:56.802
however you want to

2027
00:45:56.842 --> 00:45:57.503
do it, I'm not

2028
00:45:57.583 --> 00:45:58.244
here to tell you

2029
00:45:58.284 --> 00:45:58.885
how to set up

2030
00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:00.806
your multi-agent orchestration or
