1595
00:36:58.947 --> 00:37:00.768
make. Obviously relatively simple

1596
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:01.869
UI change, but we're

1597
00:37:01.889 --> 00:37:02.670
putting a team of

1598
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:03.510
agents to make sure

1599
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.492
the job gets done.

1600
00:37:04.612 --> 00:37:05.273
If you can deploy

1601
00:37:05.353 --> 00:37:06.233
a little bit more

1602
00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:07.166
compute, to have more

1603
00:37:07.226 --> 00:37:09.130
confidence and more trust

1604
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.990
in your agents, why

1605
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.414
wouldn't you, right? Compute

1606
00:37:11.414 --> 00:37:12.514
can solve so many

1607
00:37:12.596 --> 00:37:13.697
of your engineering problems

1608
00:37:13.918 --> 00:37:15.079
if you put the

1609
00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:16.742
compute to work. Okay,

1610
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:17.543
so here we are,

1611
00:37:17.603 --> 00:37:18.583
builder here doing some

1612
00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:19.324
thinking, right? We can

1613
00:37:19.344 --> 00:37:20.063
just dial in on

1614
00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:21.264
all the thinking of

1615
00:37:21.304 --> 00:37:22.065
our agent here if

1616
00:37:22.085 --> 00:37:22.965
we want to. And

1617
00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:23.427
of course we can

1618
00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:24.726
just specialize on just

1619
00:37:24.907 --> 00:37:25.967
our builder agent logs

1620
00:37:26.027 --> 00:37:26.849
here. If you just

1621
00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:27.949
wanna see the individual

1622
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.690
tools, we can see

1623
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.610
that as well. But

1624
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.391
what we really care
