00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:01.488
engineering with each leverage

478
00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:02.649
point of agenda coding

479
00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:03.710
that you add to

480
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.590
your codebase and

481
00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:05.551
then you build a

482
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.951
system or you find

483
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:07.772
one that lets you

484
00:12:07.892 --> 00:12:09.432
solve problems as you

485
00:12:09.452 --> 00:12:10.653
continue to move from

486
00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:11.714
in loop to out

487
00:12:11.793 --> 00:12:12.614
loop. There are so

488
00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:14.034
many problems that you

489
00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:15.115
do not need to

490
00:12:15.154 --> 00:12:16.115
be sitting in the

491
00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:17.816
terminal prompting back and

492
00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:18.976
forth to solve. All

493
00:12:18.976 --> 00:12:19.716
right, keep in mind

494
00:12:19.797 --> 00:12:21.258
a specialized tool like

495
00:12:21.258 --> 00:12:22.110
this is going to

496
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.471
be more powerful than

497
00:12:23.572 --> 00:12:24.212
some out of the

498
00:12:24.232 --> 00:12:25.975
box cloud-based tool. Why

499
00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:27.037
is that? It's because

500
00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:28.219
these tools are designed

501
00:12:28.278 --> 00:12:29.740
for everyone's codebase,

502
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.283
not yours. When you
