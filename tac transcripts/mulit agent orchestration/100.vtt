2215
00:50:00.016 --> 00:50:01.518
duplicate an agent from

2216
00:50:01.557 --> 00:50:02.579
a specific point, this

2217
00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:04.019
is one tool away.

2218
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.041
And thanks to the

2219
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.623
Cloud Agent SDK, it's

2220
00:50:06.663 --> 00:50:08.003
a few modules away

2221
00:50:08.063 --> 00:50:08.864
from being built out.

2222
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:09.364
We should be able

2223
00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:10.925
to fork context windows

2224
00:50:11.286 --> 00:50:12.648
and fork agents at

2225
00:50:12.788 --> 00:50:13.869
any point in time.

2226
00:50:14.108 --> 00:50:15.010
One big piece here,

2227
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.590
and frankly, the highest

2228
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:17.672
return on investment is

2229
00:50:17.672 --> 00:50:18.873
gonna be some really

2230
00:50:19.092 --> 00:50:21.135
well-built out autocomplete and

2231
00:50:21.235 --> 00:50:22.856
tab functionality basically a

2232
00:50:22.996 --> 00:50:24.677
dedicated language model, likely

2233
00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:26.117
a cheap, fast model

2234
00:50:26.277 --> 00:50:27.197
to help out with

2235
00:50:27.277 --> 00:50:29.059
prompt engineering right here

2236
00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:30.059
in the terminal with
