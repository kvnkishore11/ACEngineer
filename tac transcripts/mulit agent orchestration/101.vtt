00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:30.059
in the terminal with

2237
00:50:30.259 --> 00:50:31.780
auto completes for agents

2238
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.601
slash commands, templates, tools,

2239
00:50:33.641 --> 00:50:34.001
so on and so

2240
00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:34.880
forth, right? Just to

2241
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.362
help speed up agent

2242
00:50:36.382 --> 00:50:37.842
decoding even further. Okay,

2243
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:38.623
it looks like our

2244
00:50:38.742 --> 00:50:40.302
builder has finished its

2245
00:50:40.422 --> 00:50:41.523
work. This is fantastic.

2246
00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:42.463
You can see again,

2247
00:50:42.724 --> 00:50:43.684
all the work done

2248
00:50:44.144 --> 00:50:45.425
one click away, right?

2249
00:50:45.664 --> 00:50:47.985
Result oriented engineering in

2250
00:50:48.025 --> 00:50:49.867
a single interface, right?

2251
00:50:49.887 --> 00:50:51.248
Our Outlook system is

2252
00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.728
very, very powerful here.

2253
00:50:52.728 --> 00:50:53.349
A lot of systems

2254
00:50:53.389 --> 00:50:54.972
rely on pull requests.

2255
00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:56.173
That's great, but it

2256
00:50:56.273 --> 00:50:57.315
misses a lot of

2257
00:50:57.356 --> 00:50:58.157
the story. It misses

2258
00:50:58.197 --> 00:50:58.657
a lot of the

2259
00:50:58.838 --> 00:50:59.940
journey, right? We get
