00:47:59.092 --> 00:48:01.215
of Outloop agentic coding

2125
00:48:01.335 --> 00:48:03.115
system. Outloop agentic coding

2126
00:48:03.295 --> 00:48:05.237
is ultra key, right?

2127
00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:05.777
You want to have

2128
00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:07.800
multiple modes of engineering.

2129
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.320
If you need to

2130
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.865
step down into the

2131
00:48:09.865 --> 00:48:11.190
loop, which I, had

2132
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.210
to do when building

2133
00:48:12.231 --> 00:48:13.130
this out, right? I've

2134
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.490
had to do it

2135
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.791
multiple times. You can,

2136
00:48:14.952 --> 00:48:15.492
right? Hop in the

2137
00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:16.213
loop, hop in the

2138
00:48:16.253 --> 00:48:18.074
terminal, increase your presence,

2139
00:48:18.193 --> 00:48:19.375
right? Write those back

2140
00:48:19.414 --> 00:48:20.454
and forth prompts. That's

2141
00:48:20.574 --> 00:48:22.135
fine. I fully recognize

2142
00:48:22.155 --> 00:48:23.317
that is a valid

2143
00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:24.536
mode of engineering, but

2144
00:48:24.757 --> 00:48:26.077
more and more, there

2145
00:48:26.117 --> 00:48:27.179
is work you should

2146
00:48:27.239 --> 00:48:28.179
not be doing. You're

2147
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.039
wasting your time. The
