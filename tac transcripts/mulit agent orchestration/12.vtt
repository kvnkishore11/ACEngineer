00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.740
right away, this is

220
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.483
a differentiated agentic coding

221
00:06:03.642 --> 00:06:06.495
experience with multi-agent observability,

222
00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:08.846
you can see everything.

223
00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:10.507
Observability is a key

224
00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:12.247
component of a successful

225
00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:14.107
multi-agent system. Why is

226
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.327
that? It's because if

227
00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:16.427
you can't measure it,

228
00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:17.767
you can't improve it.

229
00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:18.567
And if you can't

230
00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:19.908
measure it, you can't

231
00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:21.509
scale it, okay? If

232
00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:22.408
you have 10 agents

233
00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:23.788
doing the wrong thing,

234
00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:24.689
does it matter that

235
00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:25.350
you have 10? Of

236
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.290
course not. This is

237
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.750
why observability is key

238
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.029
and it's also why

239
00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.651
the orchestrator is an
