89
00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.110
have a problem, you

90
00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:31.262
have a problem. If

91
00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:32.581
you're using agents at

92
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.622
scale, you know exactly

93
00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:35.622
what I mean. Right

94
00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:37.402
now, every engineer sits

95
00:02:37.483 --> 00:02:38.824
at one of these

96
00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:40.723
levels. Base agents, better

97
00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:42.343
agents, more agents, and

98
00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:44.004
custom agents. The theme

99
00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:45.205
here is simple. At

100
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:46.865
each step, you scale

101
00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.425
your compute to scale

102
00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:49.825
your impact. When you

103
00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:50.925
combine this with your

104
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.287
agentic coding KPIs, you

105
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.287
understand where you are

106
00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.086
on the agentic engineering

107
00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:59.147
proficiency curve. It's not

108
00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:00.055
about what you can
