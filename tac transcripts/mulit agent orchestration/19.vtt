00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:30.688
And so right here

369
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:32.009
in a single response

370
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:33.330
message, you can see

371
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.431
the actual read files

372
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:36.890
and the produced files

373
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.251
from our QA agent

374
00:09:38.392 --> 00:09:39.351
at a glance. We

375
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:39.871
can do something really

376
00:09:39.892 --> 00:09:40.451
powerful. We can of

377
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:41.452
course just see the

378
00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.352
diff right here in

379
00:09:42.452 --> 00:09:43.812
line, but more importantly,

380
00:09:43.932 --> 00:09:45.533
we can one click

381
00:09:45.758 --> 00:09:47.099
into our editor. So

382
00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:48.679
now we're operating inside

383
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.801
the loop. We're looking

384
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:50.542
at this file. We're

385
00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:52.342
actually reviewing and understanding

386
00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:53.504
what's been done in

387
00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:55.044
markdown mode here. We

388
00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:56.706
can see exactly what

389
00:09:56.725 --> 00:09:57.506
our agent has broken

390
00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:58.587
down for us. And

391
00:09:58.587 --> 00:09:59.107
this is a great

392
00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:00.990
opportunity to actually talk
