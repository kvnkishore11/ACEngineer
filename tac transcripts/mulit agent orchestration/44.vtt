WEBVTT

928
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:00.946
can call your ADWs,

929
00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:01.346
it can call your

930
00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:01.926
prompts, it can call

931
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:02.666
your agents, it can

932
00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:03.748
do it all. This

933
00:22:03.768 --> 00:22:04.448
is why this is

934
00:22:04.587 --> 00:22:05.708
the next level in

935
00:22:05.728 --> 00:22:07.769
the agent scale framework.

936
00:22:08.028 --> 00:22:10.362
Base, better, more, custom

937
00:22:10.642 --> 00:22:12.624
orchestrator. This is agentic

938
00:22:12.763 --> 00:22:14.305
engineering scale to the

939
00:22:14.384 --> 00:22:15.605
next level. So what

940
00:22:15.644 --> 00:22:16.105
else can we do

941
00:22:16.165 --> 00:22:17.406
with this? This system

942
00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:18.866
leans on a powerful

943
00:22:19.127 --> 00:22:20.989
agentic framework. The incredible

944
00:22:21.028 --> 00:22:21.909
part about this system

945
00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:22.670
is that it is

946
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.790
interoperable with the entire

947
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:26.991
Claude Code ecosystem. What

948
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:27.452
do I mean by

949
00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:28.292
that exactly? If we

950
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.713
hit control K, once

951
00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:30.354
again, you can see
