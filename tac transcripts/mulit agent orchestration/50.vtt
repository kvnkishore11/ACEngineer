1072
00:24:59.682 --> 00:25:00.722
the codebase. But

1073
00:25:00.742 --> 00:25:01.363
you can see here,

1074
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:02.743
the risk of course

1075
00:25:02.864 --> 00:25:04.265
is we are loading

1076
00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:05.486
up the context of

1077
00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:06.567
our orchestrator agent. You

1078
00:25:06.567 --> 00:25:06.968
want to keep your

1079
00:25:06.988 --> 00:25:09.431
orchestrator focused on conducting

1080
00:25:09.451 --> 00:25:10.811
commanding other agents. Still,

1081
00:25:11.192 --> 00:25:12.013
it's super important to

1082
00:25:12.054 --> 00:25:13.796
mention we're using the

1083
00:25:13.955 --> 00:25:16.659
powerful suite of tools

1084
00:25:16.838 --> 00:25:17.460
that allow us to

1085
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.922
use agents in an

1086
00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:21.344
extensible way. Okay. Using

1087
00:25:21.364 --> 00:25:22.266
an agent in the

1088
00:25:22.365 --> 00:25:23.666
loop is just the

1089
00:25:23.686 --> 00:25:24.647
beginning of what you

1090
00:25:24.688 --> 00:25:25.608
can do. Don't let

1091
00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:27.330
these other agent decoding

1092
00:25:27.371 --> 00:25:29.083
tools fool you. Cloud

1093
00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:30.165
code and the agent
