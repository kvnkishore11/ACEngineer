239
00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.651
the orchestrator is an

240
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.771
advanced agent decoding concept.

241
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:34.370
It comes last after

242
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.752
custom agents. You can

243
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:36.672
see here we have

244
00:06:36.732 --> 00:06:37.831
an interface that is

245
00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:39.574
communicating the work of

246
00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:40.336
every one of our

247
00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:41.737
agents. So we have

248
00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:43.379
responses, we have tools,

249
00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:44.079
we have thinking. We

250
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.461
can, of course, filter

251
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:46.142
on any one of

252
00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:47.024
these. We can filter

253
00:06:47.064 --> 00:06:48.706
on responses, individual tool

254
00:06:48.786 --> 00:06:49.826
calls. We can filter

255
00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:51.870
on our individual agents.

256
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.432
So here's just our

257
00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.233
QA agent. The observability

258
00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.096
here is essential for

259
00:06:57.096 --> 00:06:58.730
scaling impact. with a

260
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.492
single prompt, I've deployed
