683
00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:30.464
enable thinking. All right,

684
00:16:30.464 --> 00:16:31.163
so let's get thinking

685
00:16:31.183 --> 00:16:31.985
mode turned on here

686
00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:32.845
and we'll go ahead

687
00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:33.566
and fire that off.

688
00:16:33.645 --> 00:16:34.605
So once again here,

689
00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:35.726
the pattern is the

690
00:16:35.886 --> 00:16:37.048
same. We are talking

691
00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:38.889
just to our orchestrator

692
00:16:39.028 --> 00:16:40.149
and then our orchestrator

693
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.211
is running the multi-agent

694
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.451
prompts. Okay, so there

695
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:44.412
it goes, prompt one,

696
00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:45.873
prompt two, prompt three,

697
00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:46.514
and you can see

698
00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:48.195
that key, ultra thinking

699
00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:50.576
keyword in our individual

700
00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:51.636
agents. We have the

701
00:16:51.697 --> 00:16:52.758
brain icon here, and

702
00:16:52.817 --> 00:16:53.739
now they're starting to

703
00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:55.559
actually think through what's

704
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.600
going on here. This

705
00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:57.100
should be just a

706
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.260
quick summary. They're gonna

707
00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.081
make a quick change

708
00:16:59.101 --> 00:16:59.721
to the top of

709
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:00.923
their file. These aren't
