455
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.591
Outloop Peter system. We

456
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.011
are observing work from

457
00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:33.533
our agents outside the

458
00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:34.666
loop we are quickly

459
00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.288
operating, right? You saw

460
00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:37.568
that. This is quite

461
00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:39.350
literally a prompt input.

462
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.331
We then have our

463
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:41.692
trigger, which is our

464
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:43.232
HTTP requests coming into

465
00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:44.114
our server. And then

466
00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:45.254
we have our full

467
00:11:45.335 --> 00:11:46.475
on environment. In this

468
00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:47.797
case, it's just running

469
00:11:47.836 --> 00:11:48.577
right on my local

470
00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:49.999
environment. And of course,

471
00:11:50.178 --> 00:11:51.820
we have multi-agent observability

472
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:53.741
to manage the result

473
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.163
of our Peter framework.

474
00:11:55.222 --> 00:11:57.284
Remember tactic four, stay

475
00:11:57.524 --> 00:11:58.426
out the loop. You

476
00:11:58.446 --> 00:11:59.687
should be compounding your

477
00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:01.488
engineering with each leverage
