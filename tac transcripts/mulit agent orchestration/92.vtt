2030
00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:00.806
your multi-agent orchestration or

2031
00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:01.786
even that you need

2032
00:46:01.827 --> 00:46:02.688
to use this. Okay.

2033
00:46:02.887 --> 00:46:03.268
What I want to

2034
00:46:03.307 --> 00:46:04.449
do here is communicate

2035
00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:05.789
to you the next

2036
00:46:05.981 --> 00:46:07.503
level of agentic engineering.

2037
00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:08.985
It is very clear,

2038
00:46:09.085 --> 00:46:10.487
it's crystal clear that

2039
00:46:10.568 --> 00:46:12.490
multi-agent orchestration is a

2040
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.353
key step in scaling

2041
00:46:14.353 --> 00:46:15.856
your compute to scale

2042
00:46:16.056 --> 00:46:17.157
your impact. It is

2043
00:46:17.338 --> 00:46:18.639
very likely you're gonna

2044
00:46:18.659 --> 00:46:20.101
see big AI labs

2045
00:46:20.202 --> 00:46:21.583
build out something like

2046
00:46:21.623 --> 00:46:22.846
this, okay? You're already

2047
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:24.166
seeing some primitive versions

2048
00:46:24.186 --> 00:46:25.148
of this with the

2049
00:46:25.469 --> 00:46:26.751
cloud-based tool where you

2050
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:28.052
fire off one agent

2051
00:46:28.052 --> 00:46:29.594
at a time, back

2052
00:46:29.635 --> 00:46:30.396
and forth, back and
