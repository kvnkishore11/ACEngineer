1854
00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:30.599
these ideas, it's so

1855
00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:32.420
important to just establish

1856
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.340
these great patterns so

1857
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.440
that you can get

1858
00:42:34.501 --> 00:42:35.460
to work and get

1859
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.021
things shipped. Set up,

1860
00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:37.983
We're gonna create all

1861
00:42:38.023 --> 00:42:39.264
of our agents upfront.

1862
00:42:39.403 --> 00:42:40.244
If we hop back

1863
00:42:40.304 --> 00:42:41.206
into our tool here,

1864
00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.025
we can see that

1865
00:42:42.085 --> 00:42:42.907
we have all of

1866
00:42:42.947 --> 00:42:44.528
our agents. Our planner

1867
00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.070
is currently executing. It's

1868
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.170
putting together all the

1869
00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.472
information that our next

1870
00:42:48.592 --> 00:42:49.813
agents will need to

1871
00:42:49.932 --> 00:42:51.074
actually accomplish this task.

1872
00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:51.635
Okay, so we have

1873
00:42:51.675 --> 00:42:52.896
a team of agents

1874
00:42:53.175 --> 00:42:53.896
built to accomplish a

1875
00:42:53.916 --> 00:42:55.038
specific task, each with

1876
00:42:55.038 --> 00:42:56.478
their own role. Our

1877
00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:57.460
orchestrator agent is of

1878
00:42:57.519 --> 00:42:58.221
course in a thinking

1879
00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.561
loop. There's our response

1880
00:42:59.641 --> 00:43:00.782
UI plan, check that
