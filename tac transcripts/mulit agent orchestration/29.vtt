WEBVTT

594
00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:30.626
that we've designed it

595
00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:31.647
to be a, this

596
00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:32.447
is super important, we're

597
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:33.067
gonna touch on this

598
00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:33.787
in a moment, we've

599
00:14:33.807 --> 00:14:34.466
designed it to be

600
00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.008
a custom agent special

601
00:14:37.008 --> 00:14:38.369
specialized at solving the

602
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:39.791
problem of managing other

603
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:40.871
agents. And to do

604
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:41.832
that, we have, of

605
00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:43.955
course, adopted our agent's

606
00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:45.817
perspective. It is not

607
00:14:45.897 --> 00:14:47.259
always observing the logs.

608
00:14:47.359 --> 00:14:48.659
It cannot be. We

609
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.701
have to protect its

610
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:51.043
context window. This is

611
00:14:51.102 --> 00:14:51.764
true for your O

612
00:14:51.984 --> 00:14:53.044
agent. This is true

613
00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:54.486
for your primary agents.

614
00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:55.827
You always need to

615
00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:57.870
be monitoring and understanding

616
00:14:58.029 --> 00:14:59.591
the core four of

617
00:14:59.892 --> 00:15:01.014
every agent you boot
