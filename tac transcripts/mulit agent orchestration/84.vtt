1831
00:41:58.893 --> 00:42:00.233
this should sound familiar

1832
00:42:00.273 --> 00:42:00.914
and very in line

1833
00:42:00.934 --> 00:42:01.514
with all the ideas

1834
00:42:01.534 --> 00:42:02.675
we've been discussing. You

1835
00:42:02.715 --> 00:42:05.918
get domain-specific expert agency.

1836
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.434
through prompts. Here's how

1837
00:42:07.454 --> 00:42:08.480
this workflow works. We

1838
00:42:08.519 --> 00:42:09.885
have plan with scouts,

1839
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.030
build and review. So

1840
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.311
a three step workflow,

1841
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.891
Tactical Agentic Coding members.

1842
00:42:14.152 --> 00:42:14.952
This should make you

1843
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.012
think of something very

1844
00:42:16.092 --> 00:42:16.853
similar. It should make

1845
00:42:16.873 --> 00:42:17.333
you think of the

1846
00:42:17.532 --> 00:42:18.994
ADW. Okay. We have

1847
00:42:19.014 --> 00:42:20.954
a multi-phase step plan

1848
00:42:21.034 --> 00:42:22.755
here, three phases with

1849
00:42:22.795 --> 00:42:24.076
a final report. And

1850
00:42:24.115 --> 00:42:24.536
of course we have

1851
00:42:24.556 --> 00:42:25.456
a report section. We

1852
00:42:25.516 --> 00:42:27.878
have great consistent agentic

1853
00:42:27.998 --> 00:42:29.398
prompt engineering. You know,

1854
00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:30.599
these ideas, it's so
