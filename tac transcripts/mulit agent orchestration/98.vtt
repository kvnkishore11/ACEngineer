2166
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.822
you get concrete ADWs

2167
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:02.903
inside of your code

2168
00:49:02.923 --> 00:49:03.844
base. So there are

2169
00:49:03.844 --> 00:49:04.746
some things missing here,

2170
00:49:04.927 --> 00:49:06.730
some future directions that

2171
00:49:06.849 --> 00:49:07.411
I may take and

2172
00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.331
that I may share

2173
00:49:08.532 --> 00:49:09.835
inside of Agentic Horizon.

2174
00:49:10.295 --> 00:49:10.876
Human in the loop

2175
00:49:10.896 --> 00:49:12.177
decision points, are gonna

2176
00:49:12.177 --> 00:49:13.398
be very critical. You

2177
00:49:13.398 --> 00:49:14.358
can see a simple

2178
00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.159
interface on top of

2179
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:16.099
this where your agent

2180
00:49:16.278 --> 00:49:17.159
wants to ask you

2181
00:49:17.318 --> 00:49:18.099
a question, your agent

2182
00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:19.219
wants to prompt you.

2183
00:49:19.478 --> 00:49:20.199
This is a key

2184
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.719
point in agent engineering

2185
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.920
where your agents start

2186
00:49:23.039 --> 00:49:24.900
asking you questions versus

2187
00:49:25.021 --> 00:49:26.061
the other way around,

2188
00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:27.201
okay? That's missing here.

2189
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.460
Better management of the

2190
00:49:28.621 --> 00:49:29.641
orchestration agent. It's gonna

2191
00:49:29.641 --> 00:49:30.461
be a great direction
