2327
00:52:29.231 --> 00:52:30.030
better than any cloud

2328
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.672
tool, better than any

2329
00:52:31.672 --> 00:52:33.565
team. is the advantage,

2330
00:52:33.806 --> 00:52:34.586
okay? And you can

2331
00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:35.746
scale it hard now

2332
00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:37.527
with the multi-agent orchestration

2333
00:52:37.768 --> 00:52:39.748
and the orchestration agent,

2334
00:52:39.909 --> 00:52:40.829
all right? Now, there's

2335
00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:41.588
a big missing piece

2336
00:52:41.628 --> 00:52:42.449
here, another kind of

2337
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:43.969
final missing piece. How

2338
00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.150
does this plug into

2339
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:47.391
deterministic code? How does

2340
00:52:47.411 --> 00:52:48.112
this plug, right now,

2341
00:52:48.152 --> 00:52:49.552
this is very agentic,

2342
00:52:49.612 --> 00:52:50.373
right? We've dialed up

2343
00:52:50.413 --> 00:52:51.512
the autonomy knob here

2344
00:52:51.572 --> 00:52:52.512
quite a bit, which

2345
00:52:52.532 --> 00:52:53.666
is great, that is

2346
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:54.974
the direction, but we

2347
00:52:55.235 --> 00:52:56.436
also have a missing

2348
00:52:56.456 --> 00:52:57.896
piece of deterministic code.

2349
00:52:57.936 --> 00:52:59.197
We're missing our AI

2350
00:52:59.257 --> 00:53:01.199
developer workflows. Okay. This
