controlling your compute at

161
00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:32.781
scale. Welcome to Agenta

162
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:35.125
Horizon Lesson 4. Let's

163
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:37.149
understand the one agent

164
00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:38.718
to rule them all,

165
00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:44.543
the OA. Where is

166
00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:45.742
our input field? This

167
00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:46.543
is not a normal

168
00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:48.324
application for normal users.

169
00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:49.206
This is for you

170
00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:50.887
and I, the agentic

171
00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:53.309
engineer. We're maximizing information

172
00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:55.471
density without losing UX

173
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.572
quality. If we have

174
00:04:56.572 --> 00:04:57.913
command K here, we'll

175
00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:59.553
see our prompt input

176
00:04:59.673 --> 00:05:01.194
interface. It has useful
