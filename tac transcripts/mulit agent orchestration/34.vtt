709
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:00.923
their file. These aren't

710
00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.845
just one-off sub-agents where

711
00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:03.684
the context is blown

712
00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:04.425
away or we have

713
00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:05.625
to kind of manage

714
00:17:05.946 --> 00:17:06.787
what or where the

715
00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.228
sub-agent was. These are

716
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:09.989
primary agents that we

717
00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:11.213
can tap into over

718
00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:12.513
and over until that

719
00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:14.055
specific job is done,

720
00:17:14.154 --> 00:17:15.075
okay? Something that's gonna

721
00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:16.174
happen here, it's gonna

722
00:17:16.174 --> 00:17:17.214
be really important. Here

723
00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:18.375
are our results. Once

724
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:19.016
again, we can just

725
00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:19.915
dial into these. We

726
00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:20.415
can see all the

727
00:17:20.476 --> 00:17:22.696
consumed files versus produced

728
00:17:22.757 --> 00:17:24.557
files. This differentiation is

729
00:17:24.737 --> 00:17:25.817
very important. We can

730
00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:27.397
continue to run them

731
00:17:27.397 --> 00:17:29.130
until the job is

732
00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:30.310
done. It's important that
