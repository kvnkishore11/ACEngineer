617
00:14:59.892 --> 00:15:01.014
every agent you boot

618
00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:02.575
up. Remember, on top

619
00:15:02.654 --> 00:15:04.096
of every feature, any

620
00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.759
lab builds, any UI

621
00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:06.960
that you see, any

622
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.182
experience, it's all just

623
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.543
the core four. Don't

624
00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:12.424
let anyone confuse you,

625
00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:15.047
okay? Context, model, prompt,

626
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.207
tools. Do you know

627
00:15:16.388 --> 00:15:17.548
what these four leverage

628
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:18.909
points are at every

629
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:20.451
critical moment? All right,

630
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.371
this is key. As

631
00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:22.092
you can see here

632
00:15:22.312 --> 00:15:23.634
through our interface, We

633
00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:24.854
have a really great

634
00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:26.735
idea of the state

635
00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:27.835
of the core four

636
00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:29.014
for all of our

637
00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.676
agents. Okay. And so
