1413
00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.605
throughout your chains of

1414
00:33:00.665 --> 00:33:02.227
compute, right? Whatever leverage

1415
00:33:02.267 --> 00:33:03.248
points of agent encoding

1416
00:33:03.327 --> 00:33:04.528
you are composing, you

1417
00:33:04.548 --> 00:33:05.871
need to embed your

1418
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:08.071
engineering, right? the edge,

1419
00:33:08.272 --> 00:33:09.854
that is the advantage,

1420
00:33:09.993 --> 00:33:11.755
okay? So we have

1421
00:33:11.815 --> 00:33:13.536
been barely using our

1422
00:33:13.615 --> 00:33:15.076
orchestrator's potential. Let's scale

1423
00:33:15.096 --> 00:33:16.278
this up, let's deploy

1424
00:33:16.438 --> 00:33:19.940
a team. We know

1425
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.641
that we can run

1426
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:22.001
prompts in our orchestrator

1427
00:33:22.102 --> 00:33:23.643
agent, but the scale

1428
00:33:23.742 --> 00:33:24.242
in which we can

1429
00:33:24.282 --> 00:33:26.023
do this is not

1430
00:33:26.244 --> 00:33:28.125
truly understood. Even in

1431
00:33:28.546 --> 00:33:30.247
single agents, a lot
