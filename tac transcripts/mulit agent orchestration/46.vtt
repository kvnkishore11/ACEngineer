976
00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:00.505
fast model to do

977
00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:01.726
this. And she's gonna

978
00:23:01.726 --> 00:23:03.598
understand running the question

979
00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:05.098
prompt, let's focus in

980
00:23:05.138 --> 00:23:05.980
on that, right? What

981
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.740
just happened there? We

982
00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:08.020
were actually having our

983
00:23:08.101 --> 00:23:09.261
agent run a slash

984
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:10.541
command, a custom slash

985
00:23:10.561 --> 00:23:11.702
command, also just known

986
00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:13.584
as a reusable prompt,

987
00:23:13.784 --> 00:23:14.884
okay? Just by me

988
00:23:15.005 --> 00:23:16.265
saying that, a whole

989
00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:18.145
world of possibilities should

990
00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:19.146
be activating in your

991
00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:20.267
mind. We have access

992
00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:21.407
to the entire cloud

993
00:23:21.448 --> 00:23:22.489
code ecosystem here. We

994
00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:23.969
have access to reusable

995
00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:25.362
units of compute. we

996
00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:25.923
have access to the

997
00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:27.664
leverage points of agenda

998
00:23:27.805 --> 00:23:28.727
coding. We can tap

999
00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:30.930
into reusable prompts and
