1271
00:29:28.815 --> 00:29:30.635
It's insanely high. We

1272
00:29:30.675 --> 00:29:32.096
have custom agents, built

1273
00:29:32.135 --> 00:29:34.036
for specific purposes, built

1274
00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:35.497
for specific use cases.

1275
00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:36.497
We can deploy at

1276
00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:37.916
scale over and over

1277
00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:38.757
and over. When their

1278
00:29:38.797 --> 00:29:39.738
job is done, guess

1279
00:29:39.738 --> 00:29:40.258
what we're gonna do?

1280
00:29:40.637 --> 00:29:42.298
Delete the agent. Okay,

1281
00:29:42.438 --> 00:29:44.739
that's it. Right? This

1282
00:29:44.778 --> 00:29:45.598
is the pattern. This

1283
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:46.878
is the loop. Okay?

1284
00:29:47.038 --> 00:29:47.759
We build agents to

1285
00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:48.980
do specific work. Once

1286
00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:50.220
it's done, they're gone.

1287
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.779
They're dust. Okay? Clear

1288
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.720
all. Now we're ready

1289
00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:53.721
for the next task.

1290
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.320
All right? Scale, scale,

1291
00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:58.201
scale, observability, orchestration. It's

1292
00:29:58.422 --> 00:30:00.061
all here. This is
