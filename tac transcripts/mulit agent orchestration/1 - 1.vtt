00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.399
be here with you

15
00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:31.600
right now. We live

16
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.240
in an incredible time

17
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.662
of extraordinary opportunity. Our

18
00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:37.444
potential as engineers has

19
00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.137
never been higher. With

20
00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:41.578
the abundance of opportunity,

21
00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:42.698
there's a ton of

22
00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.319
noise, confusion, and the

23
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:45.799
fear of change and

24
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020
instability is always present.

25
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.401
Let's silence the fear

26
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.561
once again by pushing

27
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:52.240
what we can do

28
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.481
forward and by understanding

29
00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.203
the next opportunity available

30
00:00:57.243 --> 00:00:58.283
to us. There is

31
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.143
one mode of engineering
