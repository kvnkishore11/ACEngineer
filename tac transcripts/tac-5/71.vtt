1774
00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:30.614
picking up work from

1775
00:35:30.614 --> 00:35:32.373
previous agents with fresh

1776
00:35:32.373 --> 00:35:34.233
focus context windows, right?

1777
00:35:34.233 --> 00:35:35.273
So we'll type clear

1778
00:35:35.273 --> 00:35:37.733
implement and I'll pass

1779
00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:38.873
in this plan and

1780
00:35:38.952 --> 00:35:39.333
let's go ahead and

1781
00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:39.873
get to work on

1782
00:35:39.873 --> 00:35:41.512
that. And actually I'm

1783
00:35:41.512 --> 00:35:42.451
gonna hold off on

1784
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:43.690
this. I forgot I'm

1785
00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.809
running in the loop.

1786
00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:45.889
I'm running in loop

1787
00:35:45.949 --> 00:35:47.668
Agentic coding. So this

1788
00:35:47.668 --> 00:35:49.168
might modify files. This

1789
00:35:49.168 --> 00:35:50.188
agent is kind of

1790
00:35:50.188 --> 00:35:52.306
operating my device. We're

1791
00:35:52.306 --> 00:35:52.985
not running on Git

1792
00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.065
work trees or anything,

1793
00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:55.784
right? Unlike my isolated

1794
00:35:55.804 --> 00:35:57.085
device here that can

1795
00:35:57.085 --> 00:35:58.184
do whatever it wants,

1796
00:35:58.184 --> 00:35:58.943
right? We can run

1797
00:35:59.003 --> 00:35:59.722
agent can take over

1798
00:35:59.722 --> 00:36:00.782
the device here. I
