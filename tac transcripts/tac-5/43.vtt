WEBVTT

1061
00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:30.951
into the right directories.

1062
00:21:30.951 --> 00:21:32.391
That's totally cool. Nothing

1063
00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.628
interesting happening there. TSC

1064
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:35.169
emit. So we have

1065
00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.866
no front end TypeScript

1066
00:21:36.866 --> 00:21:38.346
issues. Okay. So once

1067
00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:39.763
again, We've increased the

1068
00:21:39.763 --> 00:21:41.320
confidence just a little

1069
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.960
bit. And then we're

1070
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.457
going to compile our

1071
00:21:43.457 --> 00:21:44.834
front end application here.

1072
00:21:44.874 --> 00:21:46.092
There it is, Bunrun

1073
00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:47.170
build. Our front end

1074
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.147
is now built for

1075
00:21:48.147 --> 00:21:50.585
production. Again, we're stacking

1076
00:21:50.585 --> 00:21:52.045
the confidence. We know

1077
00:21:52.164 --> 00:21:52.864
a little bit more,

1078
00:21:52.864 --> 00:21:53.604
a little bit better

1079
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:54.702
that things are going

1080
00:21:54.702 --> 00:21:55.383
to work. So here

1081
00:21:55.383 --> 00:21:56.403
we go. Now Playwright

1082
00:21:56.403 --> 00:21:57.402
is executing. Check this

1083
00:21:57.402 --> 00:21:58.061
out. If you haven't

1084
00:21:58.061 --> 00:21:58.721
played with this yet,

1085
00:21:58.721 --> 00:21:59.260
if you're not aware

1086
00:21:59.260 --> 00:21:59.961
of this, this is

1087
00:21:59.961 --> 00:22:01.720
huge. Browser control is
