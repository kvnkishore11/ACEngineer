692
00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:30.474
fire this off inside

693
00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:31.153
of our agent here.

694
00:14:31.192 --> 00:14:32.373
Super simple AI coding

695
00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:33.692
change, right? We're commenting.

696
00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:34.513
And then we're going

697
00:14:34.513 --> 00:14:35.631
to run rough. As

698
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:36.432
you can see, rough

699
00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:37.451
picked up an error.

700
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:38.610
We now have a

701
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.331
unused import. Rough is

702
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.270
looking at that change.

703
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.889
It's going to provide

704
00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:43.789
input back to our

705
00:14:43.789 --> 00:14:45.009
agent via standard out.

706
00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:45.869
Our agent picks up

707
00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:46.489
on that as it's

708
00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:47.808
context window and then

709
00:14:47.849 --> 00:14:50.008
reruns rough check. It's

710
00:14:50.008 --> 00:14:51.048
done. And now it's

711
00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:52.467
completed the work that

712
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:54.106
we wanted. Okay. So

713
00:14:54.106 --> 00:14:55.407
no issues. This is

714
00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:57.265
the simplest closed loop

715
00:14:57.265 --> 00:14:58.525
that you can imagine.

716
00:14:58.741 --> 00:14:59.821
All right. Now the

717
00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:01.041
structure of this is
