2635
00:52:29.965 --> 00:52:31.505
this software developer lifecycle.

2636
00:52:31.605 --> 00:52:32.284
We need to pack

2637
00:52:32.284 --> 00:52:32.905
this in so we

2638
00:52:32.905 --> 00:52:33.523
can get to some

2639
00:52:33.523 --> 00:52:35.822
big key Tactical Agentic

2640
00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:37.563
coding in our advanced

2641
00:52:37.643 --> 00:52:39.702
lessons along lessons six,

2642
00:52:39.722 --> 00:52:40.942
seven, and eight. There's

2643
00:52:40.942 --> 00:52:41.661
lots to say again,

2644
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.581
we glossed over some

2645
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:43.740
details, but it's all

2646
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.639
here in the code

2647
00:52:44.639 --> 00:52:46.340
base. Definitely check this

2648
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.458
out, spend some time

2649
00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:48.998
here, understand what the

2650
00:52:49.018 --> 00:52:50.777
Agentic layer of your

2651
00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:52.077
codebase can look

2652
00:52:52.077 --> 00:52:53.657
like. Start building these

2653
00:52:53.657 --> 00:52:55.137
validation loops into your

2654
00:52:55.137 --> 00:52:56.715
codebase, stand up

2655
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:58.916
concrete AI developer workflows.

2656
00:52:58.916 --> 00:52:59.215
They don't have to

2657
00:52:59.215 --> 00:53:00.835
be complex or intricate.
