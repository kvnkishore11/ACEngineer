00:18:58.426 --> 00:19:00.707
direction with your resolution

927
00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:02.267
all right request validate

928
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.786
resolve that's the anatomy

929
00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:04.986
of these closed loop

930
00:19:05.006 --> 00:19:07.165
prompts that's the structure

931
00:19:07.286 --> 00:19:08.164
of these closed loop

932
00:19:08.184 --> 00:19:09.364
prompts that allow your

933
00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:11.262
agents to test themselves.

934
00:19:11.262 --> 00:19:11.962
So let's scale this

935
00:19:11.962 --> 00:19:12.602
up. Right. We're missing

936
00:19:12.602 --> 00:19:13.402
a couple of things.

937
00:19:13.481 --> 00:19:14.820
All right. In particular,

938
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.859
we're missing some front

939
00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:16.898
end tests. All right.

940
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.478
We're also missing more

941
00:19:18.478 --> 00:19:20.237
importantly, end to end

942
00:19:20.237 --> 00:19:21.276
tests. We want our

943
00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:23.134
agents testing the application.

944
00:19:23.194 --> 00:19:23.875
I want our agents

945
00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:24.294
to be able to

946
00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.133
fully test this application,

947
00:19:26.292 --> 00:19:27.491
no matter how complex

948
00:19:27.632 --> 00:19:28.651
like you or I

949
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:30.089
would. Right. Let's scale
