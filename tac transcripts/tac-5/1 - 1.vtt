12
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.908
experience we create for

13
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.427
our users. That means

14
00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:34.366
one of the most

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.966
valuable things we can

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.561
do is making sure

17
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:38.500
that all of the

18
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.200
engineering stuff, the code

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.317
architecture features, do what

20
00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:43.277
they're meant to do

21
00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:44.716
in the first place.

22
00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:45.295
How do we do

23
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.335
that? You guessed it.

24
00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:47.874
We test, we validate,

25
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.774
we close the loop

26
00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:49.773
on the work done

27
00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:50.991
so we know for

28
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:51.771
a fact that the

29
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:53.430
experience we designed for

30
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770
our users is what's

31
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.588
in our users' hands.

32
00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.347
Agentic coding presents us

33
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.286
with a massive opportunity.
