1010
00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.974
them immediately. Then rerun

1011
00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:32.653
every validation step, okay?

1012
00:20:32.894 --> 00:20:34.013
It's not good enough.

1013
00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:35.424
to resolve this once

1014
00:20:35.424 --> 00:20:36.765
and that resolution causes

1015
00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:37.743
something to break, right?

1016
00:20:37.743 --> 00:20:38.644
You need them all

1017
00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:39.722
to run from start

1018
00:20:39.742 --> 00:20:41.281
to finish. What's happening

1019
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.001
down here. We are

1020
00:20:42.021 --> 00:20:43.601
running the Playwright MCP

1021
00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:45.060
server. Of course, valuable

1022
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.900
links is going to

1023
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.880
be available in your

1024
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.398
loot box, detailing all

1025
00:20:48.398 --> 00:20:49.897
of these services, detailing

1026
00:20:49.897 --> 00:20:50.678
all the tech we

1027
00:20:50.678 --> 00:20:51.777
use in this lesson.

1028
00:20:51.957 --> 00:20:52.856
We're running the Playwright

1029
00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:54.115
MCP server to run

1030
00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:55.615
the simple validation workflow.

1031
00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:56.115
So we're going to

1032
00:20:56.115 --> 00:20:56.654
open the browser. We're

1033
00:20:56.654 --> 00:20:57.713
going to take a

1034
00:20:57.713 --> 00:21:00.125
screenshot. We're gonna run
