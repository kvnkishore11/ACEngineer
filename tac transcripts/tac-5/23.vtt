535
00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:30.135
this ADW plan build

536
00:11:30.135 --> 00:11:31.575
test. So this specifies

537
00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:32.595
the ADW we're running.

538
00:11:32.774 --> 00:11:33.475
I'm gonna say feature.

539
00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:34.874
I'll write the prompt

540
00:11:34.874 --> 00:11:35.833
here. So create a

541
00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:38.212
new button. All right,

542
00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:39.133
so I have a

543
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.052
kind of high, maybe

544
00:11:40.052 --> 00:11:41.831
mid-level prompt here detailing

545
00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:43.171
some work. And this

546
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.910
agent, this Outloop AFK

547
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.090
agent system is going

548
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.474
to handle this for

549
00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:49.013
us agentically. So this

550
00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:49.892
is gonna run on

551
00:11:49.892 --> 00:11:51.052
our agent device here.

552
00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:51.910
Our agent has full

553
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.250
control over this machine.

554
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:54.289
If I open up

555
00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:55.110
screen, you can see

556
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.048
exactly what's going on

557
00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:56.708
here. So I have

558
00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:57.988
my agent's machine right

559
00:11:57.988 --> 00:11:59.547
here, dedicated box just

560
00:11:59.547 --> 00:12:00.427
for my agents. I
