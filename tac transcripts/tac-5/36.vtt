879
00:17:59.285 --> 00:18:01.104
quite correct. And these

880
00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:02.643
tests, these closed loop

881
00:18:02.702 --> 00:18:03.843
validators, they're going to

882
00:18:03.843 --> 00:18:04.883
help us by helping

883
00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:06.001
our agent keep all

884
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:06.842
the work that's done

885
00:18:06.842 --> 00:18:08.701
on course in check

886
00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:10.720
with the standards inside

887
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.640
of your codebase.

888
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.939
Okay. Now this is

889
00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:14.219
just a small, simple

890
00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.718
micro example, right? We

891
00:18:15.718 --> 00:18:17.809
can continue scale this

892
00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:19.130
up you'll notice here

893
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.989
you know two things

894
00:18:19.989 --> 00:18:21.608
two classes of testing

895
00:18:21.729 --> 00:18:22.669
are missing from our

896
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.449
tests and there are

897
00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:24.489
many many tests you

898
00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:25.348
can add here it's

899
00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:26.748
all about providing feedback

900
00:18:26.748 --> 00:18:27.508
for your agent this

901
00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:27.887
is going to be

902
00:18:27.887 --> 00:18:29.468
different for every engineer

903
00:18:29.468 --> 00:18:30.327
depending on the type
