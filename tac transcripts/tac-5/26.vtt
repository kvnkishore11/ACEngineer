614
00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.263
primed an agent and

615
00:13:00.263 --> 00:13:01.261
it ran our install

616
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:03.198
commands. Okay. And so

617
00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:04.498
it set up the

618
00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:05.177
front end codebase.

619
00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:05.635
It looks like I

620
00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:07.215
had a previous port

621
00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:08.312
in use. Let me

622
00:13:08.312 --> 00:13:08.852
just go ahead and

623
00:13:08.852 --> 00:13:10.010
kill that and reset

624
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:10.610
so I can run

625
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.426
sh scripts, stop scripts,

626
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.138
start. I wanna run

627
00:13:15.258 --> 00:13:16.057
on that port so

628
00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:17.138
there's no confusion down

629
00:13:17.138 --> 00:13:18.236
the line. There we

630
00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:19.197
go. There's a front

631
00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:19.697
end, there's a back

632
00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:20.356
end. Okay, so I

633
00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:21.496
do need to reset

634
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:22.975
the remote URL. I'm

635
00:13:22.975 --> 00:13:23.515
just gonna go ahead

636
00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:24.635
and run a prompt

637
00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:25.416
for this. I'll just

638
00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:26.375
pass this in here.

639
00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.096
I'm going to set

640
00:13:27.096 --> 00:13:27.655
this back to the

641
00:13:27.655 --> 00:13:28.995
TAG5 codebase. If

642
00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:30.054
you're following along, go
