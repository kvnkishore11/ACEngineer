1305
00:26:29.934 --> 00:26:30.815
a bug prompt. Let's

1306
00:26:30.815 --> 00:26:32.034
dial into that and

1307
00:26:32.034 --> 00:26:32.953
let's fix this issue,

1308
00:26:32.953 --> 00:26:33.614
right? If I go

1309
00:26:33.713 --> 00:26:34.814
here and I hit

1310
00:26:34.814 --> 00:26:36.509
refresh, We're getting the

1311
00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:37.828
new tables. Our test

1312
00:26:37.828 --> 00:26:39.189
deleted a user table.

1313
00:26:39.189 --> 00:26:40.407
They also added this

1314
00:26:40.407 --> 00:26:41.528
one and they added

1315
00:26:41.528 --> 00:26:42.467
this, you know, drop

1316
00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:43.166
user. So we have

1317
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:43.767
a bug in the

1318
00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:45.286
codebase. Okay. Let's

1319
00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:46.486
resolve that. Of course,

1320
00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:47.605
we're not coding anything,

1321
00:26:47.805 --> 00:26:48.944
right? We've stopped coding.

1322
00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:49.523
We know that that's

1323
00:26:49.523 --> 00:26:50.523
a key tactic. It's

1324
00:26:50.523 --> 00:26:52.123
the first tactic of

1325
00:26:52.123 --> 00:26:53.123
Agentic coding. What we're

1326
00:26:53.123 --> 00:26:54.622
doing here is adding

1327
00:26:54.622 --> 00:26:56.481
feedback loops in to

1328
00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.000
our templates. Okay. So

1329
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.180
once again, we're templating

1330
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.160
our engineering. If we
