1545
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.089
this is our plan

1546
00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:00.829
that it got generated,

1547
00:31:00.829 --> 00:31:01.409
right? So just to

1548
00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:02.009
make it super clear

1549
00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:04.987
here, specs, issue 111

1550
00:31:04.987 --> 00:31:05.386
ADW, and you can

1551
00:31:05.386 --> 00:31:05.806
see the rest of

1552
00:31:05.806 --> 00:31:07.006
the ID there. This

1553
00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.285
is our plan step

1554
00:31:08.285 --> 00:31:09.584
in the software development

1555
00:31:09.584 --> 00:31:11.262
lifecycle. We've automated this

1556
00:31:11.262 --> 00:31:12.529
and we've solved the

1557
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:14.128
problem of scaling our

1558
00:31:14.128 --> 00:31:15.887
impact with our plans,

1559
00:31:15.887 --> 00:31:17.387
right? Our plan velocity

1560
00:31:17.387 --> 00:31:18.106
is through the roof

1561
00:31:18.106 --> 00:31:19.487
now because we've templated

1562
00:31:19.487 --> 00:31:20.645
our engineering. How does

1563
00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:21.346
test plan of this?

1564
00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.265
You can see here

1565
00:31:22.365 --> 00:31:23.005
we have a great

1566
00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:25.223
bug description that's detailing

1567
00:31:25.243 --> 00:31:26.623
the exact issue, right?

1568
00:31:26.623 --> 00:31:28.222
It expanded on the

1569
00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:29.041
high level prompt that

1570
00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:29.801
we sent in and

1571
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:30.541
turned it into a
