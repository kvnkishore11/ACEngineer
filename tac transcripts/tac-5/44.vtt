1087
00:21:59.961 --> 00:22:01.720
huge. Browser control is

1088
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.259
another tool that you

1089
00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:04.659
can use to validate

1090
00:22:04.659 --> 00:22:05.678
work. And keep in

1091
00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:07.178
mind, I'm passing in

1092
00:22:07.178 --> 00:22:08.557
a local URL. When

1093
00:22:08.557 --> 00:22:09.556
you're building these systems,

1094
00:22:09.556 --> 00:22:10.336
when you're setting up

1095
00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:11.974
your ADW to test

1096
00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:12.734
your system and to

1097
00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:13.615
validate your work, you

1098
00:22:13.615 --> 00:22:14.673
might point this at

1099
00:22:14.673 --> 00:22:16.173
a staging system or

1100
00:22:16.173 --> 00:22:17.752
even a production test

1101
00:22:17.752 --> 00:22:18.632
account so that you

1102
00:22:18.632 --> 00:22:19.931
know that the work

1103
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.431
is complete, right? And

1104
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:22.589
notice what every one

1105
00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:23.049
of these things are

1106
00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:24.128
doing for us. We're

1107
00:22:24.128 --> 00:22:25.508
giving our agents the

1108
00:22:25.528 --> 00:22:27.106
ability to validate that

1109
00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:28.766
the work is complete,

1110
00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:30.105
okay? This helps us
