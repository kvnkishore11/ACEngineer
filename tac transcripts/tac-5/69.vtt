00:34:28.827 --> 00:34:30.346
into what the end-to-end

1725
00:34:30.346 --> 00:34:31.164
tests look like, but

1726
00:34:31.164 --> 00:34:32.543
it's very similar to

1727
00:34:32.623 --> 00:34:34.460
our Playwright prompt that

1728
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.360
we looked at before,

1729
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.199
right? Our closed loop

1730
00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:36.978
prompt, you can see

1731
00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:37.896
we have clean user

1732
00:34:37.896 --> 00:34:39.036
store here that describes

1733
00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:40.733
what we're testing exactly.

1734
00:34:40.898 --> 00:34:41.858
test steps we have

1735
00:34:41.858 --> 00:34:43.277
this powerful information dense

1736
00:34:43.277 --> 00:34:45.117
keyword verify we have

1737
00:34:45.117 --> 00:34:46.097
a variable here that

1738
00:34:46.097 --> 00:34:47.356
we're referencing from a

1739
00:34:47.396 --> 00:34:48.817
higher order prompt and

1740
00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:49.356
then we have our

1741
00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:51.235
success criteria these things

1742
00:34:51.235 --> 00:34:52.115
must be true in

1743
00:34:52.115 --> 00:34:52.936
order for this test

1744
00:34:52.956 --> 00:34:54.076
to pass and then

1745
00:34:54.076 --> 00:34:54.916
we'll dive into the

1746
00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:55.876
test end to end

1747
00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:56.635
later on in this

1748
00:34:56.635 --> 00:34:57.554
lesson but you can

1749
00:34:57.554 --> 00:34:59.474
see here this test

1750
00:34:59.474 --> 00:35:00.775
