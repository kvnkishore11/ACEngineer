979
00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:00.176
validation checks here. If

980
00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:00.576
you have some type

981
00:20:00.576 --> 00:20:01.876
of front end VITES

982
00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:03.635
or Jest tests, this

983
00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:04.036
would be the place

984
00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.236
to run those. That'll

985
00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:06.776
increase the confidence you

986
00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:07.615
have that your front

987
00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:08.496
end codebase is

988
00:20:08.496 --> 00:20:09.675
correct. And it'll give

989
00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.075
your agents the ability

990
00:20:11.194 --> 00:20:12.454
to correct the issues

991
00:20:12.454 --> 00:20:13.015
as they come up.

992
00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:13.494
And then we have

993
00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:14.394
something really cool here,

994
00:20:14.394 --> 00:20:15.454
something brand new. So

995
00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:16.355
I'm gonna just copy

996
00:20:16.355 --> 00:20:17.134
all this and let's

997
00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:17.733
go ahead and run

998
00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:18.513
this. And then we'll

999
00:20:18.513 --> 00:20:19.513
talk about what exactly

1000
00:20:19.513 --> 00:20:20.433
is happening here. So

1001
00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:21.213
let's fire this off.

1002
00:20:21.397 --> 00:20:22.137
Our agent's gonna run

1003
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:22.917
top to bottom. You

1004
00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:23.537
can see I have

1005
00:20:23.537 --> 00:20:24.797
a couple instructions here.

1006
00:20:24.876 --> 00:20:25.576
Run in order top

1007
00:20:25.576 --> 00:20:26.576
to bottom. If you

1008
00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:27.016
want to take any

1009
00:20:27.016 --> 00:20:29.236
issues, stop and resolve

1010
00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.974
them immediately. Then rerun
