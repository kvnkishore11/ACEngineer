00:51:28.682 --> 00:51:31.061
level prompts, plans, templates,

2590
00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:32.679
meta prompts, scaling all

2591
00:51:32.679 --> 00:51:33.518
the way up to

2592
00:51:33.538 --> 00:51:35.336
ADWs where we compose

2593
00:51:35.576 --> 00:51:36.954
workflows and get them

2594
00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:38.494
off our device. We

2595
00:51:38.494 --> 00:51:39.193
know about the Peter

2596
00:51:39.193 --> 00:51:40.333
framework we can use

2597
00:51:40.333 --> 00:51:42.311
to run Outloop Agentic

2598
00:51:42.311 --> 00:51:43.590
coding systems. And of

2599
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:44.650
course, whenever we need

2600
00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.088
to, we can hop

2601
00:51:46.088 --> 00:51:47.128
inside the loop, go

2602
00:51:47.128 --> 00:51:48.467
hands on and resolve

2603
00:51:48.467 --> 00:51:49.487
things very quickly. You

2604
00:51:49.487 --> 00:51:50.666
can see here this

2605
00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:51.686
bug on our main

2606
00:51:51.686 --> 00:51:52.545
branch right on this

2607
00:51:52.545 --> 00:51:54.384
device was fixed. It

2608
00:51:54.384 --> 00:51:55.304
reran all of our

2609
00:51:55.304 --> 00:51:56.222
tests and it made

2610
00:51:56.222 --> 00:51:57.222
sure that we don't

2611
00:51:57.222 --> 00:51:59.121
have this problematic issue

2612
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:00.061
here. So we can
