452
00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:00.674
prompting back and forth

453
00:10:00.674 --> 00:10:01.734
to our agents this

454
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.433
is for presentational purposes

455
00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:05.145
as you progress You

456
00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:06.005
wanna be doing less

457
00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.144
and less of this.

458
00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:08.264
You wanna stay out

459
00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:09.144
the loop, kicking off

460
00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:10.344
workflows that run in

461
00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:11.722
an agent environment. And

462
00:10:11.722 --> 00:10:12.503
so speaking of that,

463
00:10:12.643 --> 00:10:13.481
let's go ahead and

464
00:10:13.481 --> 00:10:15.121
fire off a complete

465
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:17.120
workflow where our agent

466
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.759
is gonna run the

467
00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:20.298
plan, build and test

468
00:10:20.298 --> 00:10:21.519
step of the software

469
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.977
development lifecycle. It's gonna

470
00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:23.597
take some time to

471
00:10:23.597 --> 00:10:24.378
run. It's gonna build

472
00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:25.376
a full feature and

473
00:10:25.376 --> 00:10:26.456
test it for us.

474
00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:26.836
So let me just

475
00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:27.235
go ahead and kick

476
00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:27.936
this off. So you

477
00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:28.535
can see our agents

478
00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:29.575
primed here. That's great.

479
00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:30.794
If we look at
