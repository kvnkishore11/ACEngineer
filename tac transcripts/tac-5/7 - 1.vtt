143
00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.225
testing as a critical

144
00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:31.724
leverage point of Agentic

145
00:03:31.724 --> 00:03:33.123
coding in your code

146
00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:34.562
base. That brings us

147
00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:35.582
to the lesson five

148
00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.921
tactic. The tactic here

149
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:37.941
is dead simple. It

150
00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:39.060
builds on a principle

151
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.000
of AI coding you've

152
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.258
likely heard before. The

153
00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:42.853
lesson five tactic is

154
00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:45.461
always add feedback loops.

155
00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.293
Your work, my work,

156
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.731
any engineer's work is

157
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.790
useless unless it's tested.

158
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:51.870
The ultimate test will

159
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.528
always be your users.

160
00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:54.548
The next best test

161
00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:55.806
is you. Well, it

162
00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.026
used to be. Now,

163
00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:58.186
the next best test

164
00:03:58.205 --> 00:03:59.185
is an army of

165
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.264
agents validating your entire
