1644
00:32:58.771 --> 00:33:00.391
closed feedback loop for

1645
00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:02.111
our system to correct

1646
00:33:02.111 --> 00:33:03.609
itself. All right, so

1647
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:04.489
let's look at how

1648
00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:05.288
our other plan has

1649
00:33:05.288 --> 00:33:05.907
done. You can see

1650
00:33:05.907 --> 00:33:07.747
we got this input

1651
00:33:07.747 --> 00:33:09.226
debounce plan. While we're

1652
00:33:09.226 --> 00:33:09.865
waiting here, let me

1653
00:33:09.865 --> 00:33:10.724
just go ahead, let's

1654
00:33:10.724 --> 00:33:12.384
kick off the implementation

1655
00:33:12.384 --> 00:33:13.423
of this. And so

1656
00:33:13.423 --> 00:33:14.222
we can implement this

1657
00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:16.461
with slash implement and

1658
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.401
we'll pass in this

1659
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.380
file. All right, and

1660
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.400
so that's all we

1661
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.179
need. Oh shoot, we

1662
00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:24.037
have a overload. Let's

1663
00:33:24.076 --> 00:33:25.155
run the implement again.

1664
00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:26.055
So we've cleared and

1665
00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:26.535
now we're going to

1666
00:33:26.535 --> 00:33:27.894
implement. Hopefully this works.

1667
00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:28.413
There we go. So

1668
00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:29.471
that looks great. All

1669
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:30.411
right, so now our
