374
00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:30.464
become more and more

375
00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:31.564
like scripts, but you

376
00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:32.464
want to be reviewing

377
00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:33.263
exactly what's in them

378
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.243
because they have massive

379
00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:35.322
control. If we open

380
00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:36.501
up the slash install

381
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.321
command, you can see

382
00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:38.660
exactly where this is

383
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.840
and exactly what this

384
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.719
looks like. Reading sample

385
00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:43.597
files as before, priming

386
00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:44.337
our agent. And then

387
00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:45.597
we're running a bunch

388
00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:46.297
of commands that we've

389
00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:47.356
run before in the

390
00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:48.566
past with the exception

391
00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:49.196
of a couple of

392
00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:50.375
things here. We're now

393
00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:51.634
going to reset our

394
00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:52.575
database so that our

395
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:53.855
SQL like database for

396
00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:55.514
application is automatically built

397
00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:56.494
up for us. We

398
00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:58.732
updated the copy.inv command

399
00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.432
to also copy the
