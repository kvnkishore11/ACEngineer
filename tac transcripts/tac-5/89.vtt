2234
00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:30.469
the output formats. You

2235
00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:31.268
can see exactly what

2236
00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:32.527
this is reporting for

2237
00:44:32.527 --> 00:44:33.266
every end to end

2238
00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:34.467
test that runs. All

2239
00:44:34.467 --> 00:44:36.001
right. So that's this

2240
00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:37.081
and we're looping through

2241
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:38.320
here. We're running on

2242
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.119
every one of our

2243
00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:39.719
end to end test

2244
00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:40.958
files. As you can

2245
00:44:40.958 --> 00:44:41.918
see, right, I know

2246
00:44:41.918 --> 00:44:42.739
I'm kind of moving

2247
00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:43.378
through this quickly, but

2248
00:44:43.378 --> 00:44:44.378
there's a lot here.

2249
00:44:44.478 --> 00:44:45.317
Really take the time,

2250
00:44:45.336 --> 00:44:46.416
dial into this file,

2251
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:47.456
understand what's going on.

2252
00:44:47.635 --> 00:44:48.436
But the key here

2253
00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:49.514
is it's actually quite

2254
00:44:49.514 --> 00:44:51.195
simple. We're taking all

2255
00:44:51.195 --> 00:44:51.773
of our end to

2256
00:44:51.773 --> 00:44:52.873
end tests that we're

2257
00:44:52.873 --> 00:44:53.793
going to be building

2258
00:44:53.873 --> 00:44:55.472
up as we stack

2259
00:44:55.552 --> 00:44:56.492
up the work we're

2260
00:44:56.492 --> 00:44:58.331
doing, the useful work

2261
00:44:58.331 --> 00:44:59.471
we're doing for users

2262
00:44:59.471 --> 00:45:00.289
in this codebase.
