506
00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:00.528
trigger. And so I'm

507
00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:01.168
going to write a

508
00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:02.229
prompt and put here

509
00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:02.729
and let's go ahead

510
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:04.629
and do this random

511
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:06.648
natural language query. Let's

512
00:11:06.648 --> 00:11:07.288
also open up the

513
00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:08.087
application to get a

514
00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:09.087
refresh. And what we

515
00:11:09.087 --> 00:11:09.607
want to do here

516
00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:10.148
is just add a

517
00:11:10.148 --> 00:11:11.548
simple button. We want

518
00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:12.486
our agent to handle

519
00:11:12.486 --> 00:11:13.267
all this work for

520
00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:13.746
us. We don't need

521
00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:14.466
to be doing any

522
00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.366
of this feature building

523
00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:15.846
work. But we're going

524
00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:16.407
to build a new

525
00:11:16.407 --> 00:11:17.287
feature where we click

526
00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:17.726
a button and we

527
00:11:17.726 --> 00:11:18.706
want to have a

528
00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:20.125
brand new natural language

529
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:21.826
SQL query created for

530
00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:22.446
us that helps us

531
00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:23.918
just get started with

532
00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.596
querying in our test

533
00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:26.836
application here. All right,

534
00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:27.616
so I'm gonna type

535
00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:30.135
this ADW plan build
