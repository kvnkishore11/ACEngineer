2181
00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:30.168
piece of this, of

2182
00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:31.887
course, if we scroll

2183
00:43:31.887 --> 00:43:32.887
up to that test

2184
00:43:32.947 --> 00:43:34.025
end to end, so

2185
00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:35.005
we have our end

2186
00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:35.965
to end tests, and

2187
00:43:35.965 --> 00:43:36.525
this is gonna run

2188
00:43:36.525 --> 00:43:37.945
our playwright tests. We

2189
00:43:37.945 --> 00:43:39.443
can search slash test

2190
00:43:39.563 --> 00:43:40.443
end to end. If

2191
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:41.402
you're ever wondering where

2192
00:43:41.402 --> 00:43:42.023
a prompt is in

2193
00:43:42.023 --> 00:43:42.902
the codebase, just

2194
00:43:42.922 --> 00:43:44.222
type slash, and then,

2195
00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:44.800
you know, the name

2196
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.400
of the file and

2197
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.101
you'll find it. Let's

2198
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.340
break down our test

2199
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:47.920
end to end. You

2200
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.539
can see that this

2201
00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:50.298
is indeed a higher

2202
00:43:50.298 --> 00:43:51.197
order prompt. This is

2203
00:43:51.197 --> 00:43:52.077
a hop because we're

2204
00:43:52.077 --> 00:43:54.077
passing in another prompt

2205
00:43:54.077 --> 00:43:54.597
that is the end

2206
00:43:54.597 --> 00:43:55.396
to end test file.

2207
00:43:55.396 --> 00:43:55.956
And those are all

2208
00:43:55.956 --> 00:43:56.896
stored here. So you

2209
00:43:56.896 --> 00:43:57.414
can see here, we

2210
00:43:57.414 --> 00:43:58.235
just have a few

2211
00:43:58.315 --> 00:43:58.994
end to end test

2212
00:43:58.994 --> 00:43:59.614
files and it's gonna

2213
00:43:59.614 --> 00:44:00.773
do exactly what we
