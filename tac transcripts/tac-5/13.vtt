279
00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.380
you can be very

280
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.079
confident every system is

281
00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.500
working. And with every

282
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.079
passing set of tests,

283
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.817
you free your context

284
00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:37.896
window and you stop

285
00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:39.036
second guessing so you

286
00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:40.435
can focus on what's

287
00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:41.975
next for your users.

288
00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:43.213
It's no different for

289
00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:44.413
you. or for your

290
00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:45.353
agent. If your agent

291
00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:46.132
sees something wrong with

292
00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:47.232
the auth test, you

293
00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:48.492
can't ship to production.

294
00:06:48.552 --> 00:06:49.370
It has to dive

295
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.591
into the system and

296
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:52.009
fix it. Test, let

297
00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.149
your success scale. Successful

298
00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:55.908
codebases will grow.

299
00:06:56.108 --> 00:06:57.247
As you're testing every

300
00:06:57.247 --> 00:06:58.166
net new feature with

301
00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.286
your agents, you can

302
00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:00.766
scale with confidence. With
