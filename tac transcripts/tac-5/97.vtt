00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:32.059
this ADW ID inside

2444
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:33.579
this log director, we

2445
00:48:33.579 --> 00:48:34.099
have all of our

2446
00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:35.057
agents run. We can

2447
00:48:35.057 --> 00:48:36.117
look at and inspect

2448
00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:37.496
any agent that ran

2449
00:48:37.496 --> 00:48:38.496
and we can see

2450
00:48:38.496 --> 00:48:39.476
in this file, it

2451
00:48:39.476 --> 00:48:40.114
looks like it was

2452
00:48:40.114 --> 00:48:40.894
our end to end

2453
00:48:40.894 --> 00:48:42.494
test resolver iteration one.

2454
00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:43.893
It ran this prompt,

2455
00:48:43.913 --> 00:48:45.211
tried to resolve cloud

2456
00:48:45.211 --> 00:48:46.150
code failing, which it

2457
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.409
just can't. You know,

2458
00:48:47.409 --> 00:48:47.829
we can see we

2459
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:49.387
have API error 500

2460
00:48:49.387 --> 00:48:50.646
right here. So anyway,

2461
00:48:50.686 --> 00:48:51.166
jumping out of the

2462
00:48:51.166 --> 00:48:52.025
sandbox, we can see

2463
00:48:52.025 --> 00:48:52.784
we still made a

2464
00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:53.764
lot of progress here.

2465
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.123
We got all the

2466
00:48:54.123 --> 00:48:54.782
way to the bottom

2467
00:48:54.782 --> 00:48:55.702
and we have a

2468
00:48:55.702 --> 00:48:56.802
PR. So we can

2469
00:48:56.802 --> 00:48:57.481
go ahead, take a

2470
00:48:57.481 --> 00:48:58.440
look at this PR.

2471
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.318
You can see it

2472
00:48:59.318 --> 00:49:01.257
detailed exactly what we
