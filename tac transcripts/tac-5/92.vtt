2315
00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:00.757
we just fire off

2316
00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:01.436
the scripts back to

2317
00:46:01.436 --> 00:46:02.396
back. This is again,

2318
00:46:02.396 --> 00:46:03.454
the importance of having

2319
00:46:03.574 --> 00:46:05.994
isolated reusable scripts. We're

2320
00:46:05.994 --> 00:46:07.193
using astral UV to

2321
00:46:07.193 --> 00:46:08.052
accomplish this. You can

2322
00:46:08.052 --> 00:46:09.251
use anything you want,

2323
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:10.311
classic shell scripts, bun

2324
00:46:10.311 --> 00:46:11.170
scripts, whatever you wanna

2325
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:11.791
do, but you just

2326
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:12.309
need to make sure

2327
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:13.708
that these are isolated

2328
00:46:13.748 --> 00:46:14.489
in their own, you

2329
00:46:14.489 --> 00:46:16.708
know, separate Agentic layer

2330
00:46:16.768 --> 00:46:17.686
in your codebase,

2331
00:46:17.686 --> 00:46:18.166
right? And this is

2332
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.246
what the ADW directory

2333
00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:20.297
does for us. Of

2334
00:46:20.297 --> 00:46:20.958
course, you can see

2335
00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:21.516
a couple of different

2336
00:46:21.516 --> 00:46:22.436
modules. We've broken things

2337
00:46:22.436 --> 00:46:23.056
down a little bit

2338
00:46:23.056 --> 00:46:24.914
more. We've added ADW

2339
00:46:25.014 --> 00:46:26.114
tests, right? So while

2340
00:46:26.114 --> 00:46:27.134
we're building this out,

2341
00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:28.152
we of course have

2342
00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:29.233
some tests. We're getting

2343
00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:31.371
really meta now. Ultimately,
