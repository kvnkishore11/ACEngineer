1330
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.160
our engineering. If we

1331
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.499
search end to end

1332
00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:02.538
in this bug file,

1333
00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:03.259
let me close these

1334
00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:04.057
other files. And let

1335
00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:05.541
me actually just, Where

1336
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:05.842
are we here? Let

1337
00:27:05.842 --> 00:27:07.761
me revert the code

1338
00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:08.861
base, clean everything up.

1339
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:09.921
Let's remove these two

1340
00:27:09.921 --> 00:27:13.020
files and let's proceed.

1341
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.480
All right, so just

1342
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.080
clean up the code

1343
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.740
base real quick there.

1344
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.220
So what are we

1345
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:15.960
gonna do here? We

1346
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.420
are going to search

1347
00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:18.180
end to end. So

1348
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.099
check this out, important.

1349
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.880
If this bug affects

1350
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.679
UI or user interactions,

1351
00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:23.659
we're gonna add a

1352
00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:25.318
test. Let me backtrack

1353
00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:25.939
a little bit, right?

1354
00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:27.378
We have our bug

1355
00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:29.458
reusable meta prompt. All

1356
00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:30.178
right, so we covered
