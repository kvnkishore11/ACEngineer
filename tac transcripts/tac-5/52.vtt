1283
00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:01.329
Agentic layer that we're

1284
00:26:01.329 --> 00:26:02.888
building around all of

1285
00:26:02.888 --> 00:26:04.008
our codebases. How

1286
00:26:04.008 --> 00:26:05.347
do we teach the

1287
00:26:05.347 --> 00:26:06.067
agents in our code

1288
00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:07.487
base how to test?

1289
00:26:07.547 --> 00:26:08.365
We can of course

1290
00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:10.238
embed them into our

1291
00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:12.018
templates, into our reusable

1292
00:26:12.018 --> 00:26:12.696
prompts. So if we

1293
00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:13.576
open up dot Claude,

1294
00:26:13.596 --> 00:26:14.696
go into commands, you

1295
00:26:14.696 --> 00:26:15.176
can see we have

1296
00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:16.737
a growing list of

1297
00:26:16.777 --> 00:26:19.736
reusable natural language solutions

1298
00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:21.115
that our Agentic coding

1299
00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:22.935
tools can use to

1300
00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:24.695
ship to solve all

1301
00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:25.795
types of problems that

1302
00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:26.815
we run into in

1303
00:26:26.815 --> 00:26:27.914
our codebase. Okay.

1304
00:26:27.914 --> 00:26:29.694
For instance, we have

1305
00:26:29.934 --> 00:26:30.815
a bug prompt. Let's
