208
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:00.208
agent back and forth.

209
00:05:00.507 --> 00:05:01.987
Outloop is of course

210
00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:03.047
a high level prompt

211
00:05:03.047 --> 00:05:04.026
running through the Peter

212
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:05.586
system that fires off

213
00:05:05.877 --> 00:05:07.476
on your isolated device,

214
00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:08.995
on your isolated machine.

215
00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:09.834
We're going to fire

216
00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:10.954
off an AFK agent

217
00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:12.153
in this lesson that's

218
00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:13.173
gonna run our new

219
00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:15.312
full pipeline. Now, closing

220
00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:16.071
the loop is letting

221
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:17.170
your agent operate on

222
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.889
work, calling a command

223
00:05:18.908 --> 00:05:19.867
or a tool to

224
00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:21.127
get feedback on the

225
00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:22.406
success of the work.

226
00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:23.086
You then take the

227
00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:24.204
feedback and your agent

228
00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:25.543
continues to build until

229
00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:26.903
the feedback is positive.

230
00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:27.463
This is what it

231
00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:29.122
means to close the

232
00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:29.814
loop. When you do

233
00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:30.932
this, you let the
