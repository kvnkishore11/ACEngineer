1210
00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:30.432
You do not build

1211
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:31.612
in these closed loop

1212
00:24:31.612 --> 00:24:33.011
systems with these powerful

1213
00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:34.392
closed loop prompts. You

1214
00:24:34.392 --> 00:24:34.951
are going to be

1215
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:36.871
wasting more time. Your

1216
00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:38.211
agents can be solving

1217
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:39.411
issues if you just

1218
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.750
give them a little

1219
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.651
more feedback and then

1220
00:24:41.651 --> 00:24:42.330
a little more and

1221
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.711
a little more until

1222
00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:45.191
they'll be able to

1223
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:47.431
solve a massive, massive

1224
00:24:47.431 --> 00:24:49.810
shot of issues, massive

1225
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.849
buckets of issues because

1226
00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:53.349
they have feedback loops.

1227
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.930
And so the whole

1228
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.490
point of what we're

1229
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.309
doing here is save

1230
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:57.589
yourself some more time,

1231
00:24:57.589 --> 00:24:59.334
become more of an

1232
00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:01.094
Agentic Engineer, lean into
