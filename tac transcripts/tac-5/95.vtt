00:47:29.885 --> 00:47:32.485
ADW ID right here.

2398
00:47:33.204 --> 00:47:34.144
We can see this

2399
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:35.045
at the top of

2400
00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:36.164
the file here, starting

2401
00:47:36.164 --> 00:47:37.123
workflow ID. This is

2402
00:47:37.123 --> 00:47:38.143
our AI developer workflow

2403
00:47:38.143 --> 00:47:39.244
ID. We can copy

2404
00:47:39.244 --> 00:47:40.244
that and then we

2405
00:47:40.244 --> 00:47:41.724
can quickly search that.

2406
00:47:41.724 --> 00:47:42.523
And this is the

2407
00:47:42.523 --> 00:47:44.322
importance of observability and

2408
00:47:44.322 --> 00:47:45.023
tracing. You wanna know

2409
00:47:45.023 --> 00:47:46.143
exactly what's going on

2410
00:47:46.623 --> 00:47:47.802
inside of our code

2411
00:47:47.802 --> 00:47:48.862
base. In these code

2412
00:47:48.862 --> 00:47:49.922
bases, we have this

2413
00:47:49.922 --> 00:47:51.945
agent directory as well

2414
00:47:51.945 --> 00:47:54.106
as our logs directory

2415
00:47:54.364 --> 00:47:55.625
that trails and traces

2416
00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:56.925
everything that's happened. We're

2417
00:47:56.925 --> 00:47:57.364
gonna be talking about

2418
00:47:57.364 --> 00:47:59.244
documentation and reviewing and

2419
00:47:59.244 --> 00:48:00.284
subsequent lessons, but let
