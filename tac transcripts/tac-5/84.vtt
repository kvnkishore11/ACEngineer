WEBVTT

2106
00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:00.226
we can hand off

2107
00:42:00.347 --> 00:42:01.626
any issues that arise

2108
00:42:01.626 --> 00:42:03.804
to individual agents, right?

2109
00:42:03.804 --> 00:42:05.423
By getting concrete feedback,

2110
00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:06.643
we can pass these

2111
00:42:06.643 --> 00:42:08.442
into full on new

2112
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.181
isolated agents with their

2113
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:11.760
own context window. I

2114
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.219
hope you can see

2115
00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:13.259
how things are starting

2116
00:42:13.259 --> 00:42:14.617
to work together. I

2117
00:42:14.617 --> 00:42:15.336
hope you're seeing some

2118
00:42:15.456 --> 00:42:16.916
common patterns. You can

2119
00:42:16.916 --> 00:42:17.916
do anything you want

2120
00:42:17.916 --> 00:42:18.795
in the ADW. This

2121
00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:20.253
is where you compose

2122
00:42:20.481 --> 00:42:21.782
your prompts, your Agentic

2123
00:42:21.782 --> 00:42:23.840
prompts, the new world

2124
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:24.800
of engineering with the

2125
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.920
old world, right? Just

2126
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.561
deterministic code. After we

2127
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:28.539
run these tests, right,

2128
00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:29.079
we have our test

2129
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.519
responses, we parse the
