1798
00:35:59.722 --> 00:36:00.782
the device here. I

1799
00:36:00.782 --> 00:36:01.942
have to run one

1800
00:36:01.942 --> 00:36:02.601
at a time, okay?

1801
00:36:02.601 --> 00:36:03.621
And this is one

1802
00:36:03.621 --> 00:36:05.001
limitation of in loop

1803
00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:06.380
Agentic coding. You're pretty

1804
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.420
much limited one agent

1805
00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.739
unless you're conscious about

1806
00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.239
everything that you're changing.

1807
00:36:10.498 --> 00:36:11.539
Okay. This is great.

1808
00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:12.358
This is running. It

1809
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:13.199
looks like we're going

1810
00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:13.878
to implement that. This

1811
00:36:13.878 --> 00:36:14.358
is going to build

1812
00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:14.918
up the future. I'm

1813
00:36:14.918 --> 00:36:16.438
not super concerned with

1814
00:36:16.438 --> 00:36:17.538
the results of this.

1815
00:36:17.538 --> 00:36:18.416
I mainly just want

1816
00:36:18.436 --> 00:36:20.197
to showcase how our

1817
00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:21.016
agent is going to

1818
00:36:21.077 --> 00:36:22.996
run these self-validating loops,

1819
00:36:23.036 --> 00:36:23.936
right? So inside of

1820
00:36:23.936 --> 00:36:25.036
this plan, right in

1821
00:36:25.036 --> 00:36:25.835
our issue one, one,

1822
00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:27.715
one, or fixing this

1823
00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:28.934
validation command, right? You

1824
00:36:28.934 --> 00:36:29.735
can see our agent

1825
00:36:29.735 --> 00:36:31.094
has started the test
