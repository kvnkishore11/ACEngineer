2080
00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:30.369
codebase, fully understand

2081
00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:31.148
it, copy it, make

2082
00:41:31.148 --> 00:41:32.028
it your own. But

2083
00:41:32.028 --> 00:41:32.889
the key pieces are

2084
00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:34.108
here, right? Front end

2085
00:41:34.108 --> 00:41:34.987
test, back end test,

2086
00:41:34.987 --> 00:41:36.208
and then report in

2087
00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:37.608
this format. Okay, so

2088
00:41:37.608 --> 00:41:38.827
we're running our back

2089
00:41:38.827 --> 00:41:39.806
end tests, just like

2090
00:41:39.806 --> 00:41:40.646
you saw before. A

2091
00:41:40.766 --> 00:41:42.126
couple more details, nothing,

2092
00:41:42.226 --> 00:41:43.507
you know, massively changed

2093
00:41:43.507 --> 00:41:44.306
here. All right, we're

2094
00:41:44.306 --> 00:41:46.485
compiling some files, running

2095
00:41:46.565 --> 00:41:47.965
rough, running PyTest. All

2096
00:41:47.965 --> 00:41:48.925
right, same thing for

2097
00:41:48.925 --> 00:41:50.045
the front, TypeScript compile.

2098
00:41:50.273 --> 00:41:50.974
and then we're building

2099
00:41:50.974 --> 00:41:51.793
the front end, right?

2100
00:41:51.793 --> 00:41:52.871
We're adding more validation

2101
00:41:52.871 --> 00:41:54.391
layers. Great. We're then

2102
00:41:54.391 --> 00:41:55.690
reporting in this JSON

2103
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.610
structure. Why are we

2104
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.628
reporting in this JSON

2105
00:41:57.628 --> 00:41:59.228
structure? Well, so that

2106
00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:00.226
we can hand off
