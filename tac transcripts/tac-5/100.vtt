2522
00:49:59.077 --> 00:50:00.538
queries over and over

2523
00:50:00.538 --> 00:50:02.157
and over. This is

2524
00:50:02.356 --> 00:50:03.677
pretty cool, all right?

2525
00:50:03.677 --> 00:50:04.615
And this all happened

2526
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.394
off device with our

2527
00:50:06.394 --> 00:50:08.394
powerful Outloop system that

2528
00:50:08.574 --> 00:50:10.353
built, planned and tested.

2529
00:50:10.353 --> 00:50:11.612
And so now you

2530
00:50:11.612 --> 00:50:12.713
and I, the human

2531
00:50:12.713 --> 00:50:13.552
engineer comes in here

2532
00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:14.431
at the end and

2533
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:15.692
makes sure that everything

2534
00:50:15.692 --> 00:50:16.831
looks good. It's the

2535
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:17.811
test on top of

2536
00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:18.690
the test, right? This

2537
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.454
is higher confidence. This

2538
00:50:20.494 --> 00:50:23.190
is improved engineering. More

2539
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.811
and more, you can

2540
00:50:23.811 --> 00:50:25.150
see we're shipping end

2541
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.889
to end. There are

2542
00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:26.887
a lot of key

2543
00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:28.226
big ideas here. We

2544
00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:30.246
are generating plans with
