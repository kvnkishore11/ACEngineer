00:20:57.713 --> 00:21:00.125
screenshot. We're gonna run

1035
00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.085
a query. Our agent

1036
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:02.064
is gonna type for

1037
00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:02.564
us, right? It's gonna

1038
00:21:02.564 --> 00:21:04.282
operate the browser, query,

1039
00:21:04.462 --> 00:21:05.662
take a screenshot, and

1040
00:21:05.662 --> 00:21:07.141
then read both images

1041
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:08.240
and verify that the

1042
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.838
natural language query was

1043
00:21:09.838 --> 00:21:11.357
executed correctly, all right?

1044
00:21:11.586 --> 00:21:13.085
confirm seven results are

1045
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.743
returned. So this is

1046
00:21:13.743 --> 00:21:15.262
a very specific test,

1047
00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:16.761
right? It validates a

1048
00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:18.540
precise result from our

1049
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.579
codebase given the

1050
00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:20.398
state of our code

1051
00:21:20.398 --> 00:21:21.259
base. All right. So

1052
00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:21.679
you can see it

1053
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:22.718
here working through. If

1054
00:21:22.718 --> 00:21:23.616
we scroll back up,

1055
00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:24.816
you can see those

1056
00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:25.895
tests are passing, right?

1057
00:21:25.895 --> 00:21:26.494
The codebase is

1058
00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.134
in a good state

1059
00:21:27.134 --> 00:21:28.054
right now. So that's

1060
00:21:28.054 --> 00:21:29.452
great. That's a CD

1061
00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:30.951
into the right directories.
