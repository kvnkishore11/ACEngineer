1900
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.460
our engineering. And so

1901
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.978
our slash bug command

1902
00:38:01.978 --> 00:38:02.498
here, if I open

1903
00:38:02.498 --> 00:38:03.219
up a new instance

1904
00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:04.099
here, right? If I

1905
00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:05.650
type slash bug, I

1906
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.929
just have access to

1907
00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:07.648
this template and I

1908
00:38:07.648 --> 00:38:08.887
can just quickly, you

1909
00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:10.385
know, solve any type

1910
00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:11.764
of bug inside of

1911
00:38:11.764 --> 00:38:12.943
my codebase, right?

1912
00:38:12.943 --> 00:38:13.963
With just one slash

1913
00:38:13.983 --> 00:38:15.521
command, very powerful. We're

1914
00:38:15.521 --> 00:38:16.402
scaling up. We're letting

1915
00:38:16.402 --> 00:38:17.260
our agents do more

1916
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.820
work. And most importantly,

1917
00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:20.199
we can quickly run

1918
00:38:20.338 --> 00:38:21.277
all this work in

1919
00:38:21.277 --> 00:38:22.697
an off loop device

1920
00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:24.215
with our ADW tooling,

1921
00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:25.175
right? With our AI

1922
00:38:25.175 --> 00:38:26.713
developer workflows, which we'll

1923
00:38:26.713 --> 00:38:27.413
get to our big

1924
00:38:27.413 --> 00:38:28.233
last workflow here in

1925
00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:28.972
just a moment. We

1926
00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:30.210
then templated our engineering.
