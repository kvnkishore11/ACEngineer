2262
00:44:59.471 --> 00:45:00.289
in this codebase.

2263
00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:00.789
And then we're going

2264
00:45:00.789 --> 00:45:01.409
to be able to

2265
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.688
quickly test them end

2266
00:45:02.688 --> 00:45:03.668
to end. All right.

2267
00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:04.268
So this is a

2268
00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.768
way to scale what

2269
00:45:05.768 --> 00:45:06.646
your agents can do,

2270
00:45:06.646 --> 00:45:07.047
it's a way to

2271
00:45:07.047 --> 00:45:08.505
scale the work is

2272
00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:10.184
tested and you'll notice

2273
00:45:10.483 --> 00:45:11.483
it's gonna run every

2274
00:45:11.483 --> 00:45:12.302
single test, it's gonna

2275
00:45:12.302 --> 00:45:13.442
run every single test

2276
00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:14.101
and then try to

2277
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:16.599
resolve any issues agentically.

2278
00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:17.998
So this is our

2279
00:45:17.998 --> 00:45:18.577
run end to end

2280
00:45:18.577 --> 00:45:20.710
tests. that's in run

2281
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.269
end to end test

2282
00:45:21.269 --> 00:45:22.248
with resolution. So we're

2283
00:45:22.248 --> 00:45:23.409
gonna loop through end

2284
00:45:23.409 --> 00:45:25.489
times and try to

2285
00:45:25.628 --> 00:45:26.728
correct any issues if

2286
00:45:26.728 --> 00:45:27.648
there are any. It's

2287
00:45:27.648 --> 00:45:28.688
all controllable with our

2288
00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:29.907
retry parameters here at

2289
00:45:29.907 --> 00:45:30.588
the top. And you
