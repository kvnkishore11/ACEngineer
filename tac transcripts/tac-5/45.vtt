1110
00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:30.105
okay? This helps us

1111
00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:31.144
stay out the loop,

1112
00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:32.003
right? This is literally

1113
00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:33.262
happening on this machine

1114
00:22:33.262 --> 00:22:34.123
right now. We fired

1115
00:22:34.123 --> 00:22:35.501
off an entire feature

1116
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.301
to get built. This

1117
00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:37.040
is happening on this

1118
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.059
device, all right? And

1119
00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:38.880
we're building up to

1120
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.919
that. Let's go ahead

1121
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:40.558
and see how we've

1122
00:22:40.558 --> 00:22:41.798
done here. It's got

1123
00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:43.696
the screenshot end-to-end after,

1124
00:22:43.757 --> 00:22:44.396
and now it's reading

1125
00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:45.915
those files. And let's

1126
00:22:45.935 --> 00:22:46.674
see what it's done

1127
00:22:46.674 --> 00:22:47.315
with the validation. It

1128
00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:48.294
looks like everything's working.

1129
00:22:48.294 --> 00:22:49.334
It's not going back

1130
00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:50.394
in and building anything.

1131
00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:51.192
Let's see what it's

1132
00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:52.093
done here. And you

1133
00:22:52.093 --> 00:22:52.752
can see here, you

1134
00:22:52.752 --> 00:22:54.192
know, I've removed the

1135
00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:55.711
request part of the

1136
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:56.951
closed loop. This is

1137
00:22:56.951 --> 00:22:59.171
just validation and resolution.

1138
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.070
I just wanna focus
