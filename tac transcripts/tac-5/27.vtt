642
00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:30.054
you're following along, go

643
00:13:30.054 --> 00:13:31.554
ahead, create your own

644
00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:33.294
separate repository and then

645
00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:34.235
set the origin to

646
00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:34.854
that. So here we

647
00:13:34.854 --> 00:13:35.374
go. This is going

648
00:13:35.374 --> 00:13:37.173
to automatically set here.

649
00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:38.404
Fantastic. So let's write

650
00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:40.264
our first closed loop

651
00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:41.423
prompt. So this is

652
00:13:41.423 --> 00:13:42.243
a prompt that's going

653
00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.181
to validate itself. Hopefully

654
00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:45.181
you've already seen these

655
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:46.080
and you've used them,

656
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.679
but I want to

657
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:47.739
start here to set

658
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:48.697
up a great foundation

659
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:49.738
to how we'll scale

660
00:13:49.738 --> 00:13:51.317
up to multiple closed

661
00:13:51.436 --> 00:13:52.296
loops. I'm just going

662
00:13:52.296 --> 00:13:52.796
to open up a

663
00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:53.595
blank file. I like

664
00:13:53.595 --> 00:13:54.433
to do this when

665
00:13:54.474 --> 00:13:55.754
I'm creating prompts and

666
00:13:55.754 --> 00:13:56.312
I'll just type this.

667
00:13:56.332 --> 00:13:57.792
So update. So we'll

668
00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:58.652
open up the SQL

669
00:13:58.652 --> 00:13:59.571
processor here and I

670
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:00.071
just want to do
