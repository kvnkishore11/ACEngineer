00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:00.974
have think hard. the

1852
00:37:00.974 --> 00:37:03.231
Claude Code, Anthropic, Encoded

1853
00:37:03.231 --> 00:37:04.650
Information Dense Keyword. This

1854
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.429
is a principle of

1855
00:37:05.429 --> 00:37:06.329
AI coding. There are

1856
00:37:06.329 --> 00:37:07.307
keywords that you can

1857
00:37:07.307 --> 00:37:08.286
create or that you'll

1858
00:37:08.286 --> 00:37:09.686
be able to reference

1859
00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:10.625
that have more meaning,

1860
00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:11.405
that have some special

1861
00:37:11.405 --> 00:37:13.143
effects. The Think Hard

1862
00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:15.161
activates the Cloud Series

1863
00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:16.619
models thinking modes, right?

1864
00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:16.920
So you can see

1865
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.199
that happening here. Elec

1866
00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:18.998
already knew that, but

1867
00:37:18.998 --> 00:37:19.996
it's important to mention.

1868
00:37:20.077 --> 00:37:21.155
We are now running

1869
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:22.135
tests and we're executing

1870
00:37:22.135 --> 00:37:24.106
our validation commands. So

1871
00:37:24.106 --> 00:37:24.585
if you open up

1872
00:37:24.585 --> 00:37:25.623
the validation commands, you

1873
00:37:25.623 --> 00:37:26.681
can see all these

1874
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:27.641
tests are running. They're

1875
00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:29.018
passing. That looks great.

1876
00:37:29.059 --> 00:37:29.996
And this agent is

1877
00:37:29.996 --> 00:37:30.815
going to run to
