2129
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.519
responses, we parse the

2130
00:42:30.519 --> 00:42:31.519
results, and then we

2131
00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:32.699
try to resolve any

2132
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:34.358
failed tests. And what

2133
00:42:34.358 --> 00:42:34.958
do you think the

2134
00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:35.978
failed tests do? Of

2135
00:42:35.978 --> 00:42:37.219
course, they do one

2136
00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:38.657
thing. They run a

2137
00:42:38.657 --> 00:42:40.797
template, resolve failed test.

2138
00:42:40.994 --> 00:42:42.313
resolve failed test, right?

2139
00:42:42.313 --> 00:42:43.092
So we're going to

2140
00:42:43.092 --> 00:42:44.851
get that failed test

2141
00:42:44.952 --> 00:42:46.431
input that was created

2142
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.010
by our top level

2143
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.130
testing agent. And then

2144
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.769
we're going to fire

2145
00:42:49.769 --> 00:42:51.648
off a new individual

2146
00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:53.068
agent right here. Okay,

2147
00:42:53.068 --> 00:42:54.128
you know, we're looping

2148
00:42:54.128 --> 00:42:54.688
through all the failed

2149
00:42:54.688 --> 00:42:55.626
tests and kicking off

2150
00:42:55.646 --> 00:42:57.545
individual agents to resolve

2151
00:42:57.545 --> 00:42:59.186
the failed test. Okay,

2152
00:42:59.186 --> 00:42:59.764
so this is super

2153
00:42:59.764 --> 00:43:01.244
important. We can parallelize
