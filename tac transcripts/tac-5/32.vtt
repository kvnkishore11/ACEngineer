WEBVTT

772
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.119
unit tester and we

773
00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:02.878
have a compilation command.

774
00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:03.721
All right, so we're

775
00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:04.980
starting to stack up

776
00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.399
feedback mechanisms for our

777
00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:08.658
agent, okay? This is

778
00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:10.037
still just the beginning

779
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:10.475
of what we can

780
00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:11.336
do with this. Here

781
00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:11.875
we go, let's watch

782
00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:12.615
what our agent does

783
00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:13.313
here. So we have

784
00:16:13.313 --> 00:16:15.173
this insights endpoint here,

785
00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:15.631
and this is gonna

786
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:17.291
get removed momentarily. So

787
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.250
it moved the load,

788
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:18.730
and now it's gonna

789
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.869
run rough. There it

790
00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:20.768
is. So there's an

791
00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:21.508
issue here, right? We

792
00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:22.466
can't have load env

793
00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:24.313
above an import. Ruff

794
00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:25.332
found this. So it

795
00:16:25.332 --> 00:16:26.373
was passed right into

796
00:16:26.373 --> 00:16:27.533
the standard in of

797
00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:28.392
our agent and our

798
00:16:28.392 --> 00:16:29.371
agent is going to

799
00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:30.010
move this. It's gonna
