1825
00:36:29.735 --> 00:36:31.094
has started the test

1826
00:36:31.114 --> 00:36:32.353
to validate step. So

1827
00:36:32.353 --> 00:36:33.054
it's going to first

1828
00:36:33.054 --> 00:36:34.333
run tests. and then

1829
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:35.253
it's gonna execute all

1830
00:36:35.253 --> 00:36:36.972
of our regression validation

1831
00:36:36.972 --> 00:36:37.572
tests, right? So it's

1832
00:36:37.572 --> 00:36:38.713
gonna run all of

1833
00:36:38.713 --> 00:36:39.911
these commands next. And

1834
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:40.492
so this is super

1835
00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:41.612
powerful. This is gonna

1836
00:36:41.612 --> 00:36:43.170
keep working and you

1837
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.411
can see the closed

1838
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:45.170
loop system getting to

1839
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.210
work, okay? I can

1840
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:46.690
see that there are

1841
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.530
some tables in the

1842
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.088
database. I'm running thinking

1843
00:36:49.088 --> 00:36:49.869
mode by the way

1844
00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:50.889
with the information dense

1845
00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:52.547
keyword in our implement

1846
00:36:53.148 --> 00:36:54.487
higher order prompt, right?

1847
00:36:54.487 --> 00:36:55.646
A prompt that takes

1848
00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.626
a prompt as a

1849
00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:58.465
parameter, right? An argument.

1850
00:36:58.485 --> 00:36:59.146
You can see I

1851
00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:00.974
have think hard. the
