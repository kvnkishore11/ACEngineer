2054
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:00.556
click into this, we

2055
00:41:00.556 --> 00:41:01.556
have this high level

2056
00:41:01.835 --> 00:41:03.056
method that's going to

2057
00:41:03.255 --> 00:41:04.255
run tests. And so

2058
00:41:04.255 --> 00:41:04.835
it's going to run

2059
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:06.014
all these tests a

2060
00:41:06.014 --> 00:41:07.353
number of times. And

2061
00:41:07.353 --> 00:41:07.873
if we go into

2062
00:41:07.873 --> 00:41:09.512
run tests, everything comes

2063
00:41:09.512 --> 00:41:10.811
down to a reusable

2064
00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:12.032
prompt, right? As cloud

2065
00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:13.030
code calls these a

2066
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.869
custom slash command run

2067
00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:15.730
test does this, let's

2068
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.248
go ahead and open

2069
00:41:16.248 --> 00:41:17.369
this up, right slash

2070
00:41:17.369 --> 00:41:19.168
test MD purpose here.

2071
00:41:19.168 --> 00:41:20.447
So run front end

2072
00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:21.427
back in tests and

2073
00:41:21.427 --> 00:41:22.746
return a standardized JSON

2074
00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:23.789
format so that we

2075
00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:25.630
can automate agents. All

2076
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.409
right, so let's skip

2077
00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:26.869
over some of the

2078
00:41:26.869 --> 00:41:27.989
instructions. You can of

2079
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:28.869
course dial into this

2080
00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:30.369
codebase, fully understand
