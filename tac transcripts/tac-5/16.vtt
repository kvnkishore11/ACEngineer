00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:00.528
feedback loops all right

350
00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:01.208
so let's go ahead

351
00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:02.646
open the terminal if

352
00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:03.047
i allow us you

353
00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:03.607
can see our previous

354
00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:04.887
four lessons we're going

355
00:08:04.887 --> 00:08:05.726
to clone in the

356
00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:06.887
lesson 5 codebase

357
00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:08.326
and get started this

358
00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:09.047
will be available to

359
00:08:09.047 --> 00:08:10.127
you link in your

360
00:08:10.127 --> 00:08:11.367
loop box below i'll

361
00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.745
cd into tac5 and

362
00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:14.706
boot up code in

363
00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:16.326
this directory all right

364
00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:17.625
let's open claude in

365
00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.290
yolo mode And let's

366
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.168
get the application agentically

367
00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:22.127
installed. So I'm gonna

368
00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.108
run clear slash install.

369
00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:25.026
So of course you

370
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:25.766
can trust me, but

371
00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:26.826
always review these slash

372
00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.564
commands. As mentioned, these

373
00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:29.685
reusable prompts are gonna

374
00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:30.464
become more and more
