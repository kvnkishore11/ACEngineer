1750
00:34:59.474 --> 00:35:00.775
thanks to us templating

1751
00:35:00.954 --> 00:35:02.255
our engineering practice of

1752
00:35:02.255 --> 00:35:03.974
testing into our bug

1753
00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:07.094
reusable meta prompt this

1754
00:35:07.094 --> 00:35:09.038
is now agentically going

1755
00:35:09.038 --> 00:35:10.018
to create this end-to-end

1756
00:35:10.018 --> 00:35:10.898
test for us. And

1757
00:35:10.898 --> 00:35:11.418
we can of course

1758
00:35:11.438 --> 00:35:12.016
spin this up as

1759
00:35:12.016 --> 00:35:13.177
well. I'm gonna copy

1760
00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.237
the reference to this,

1761
00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:15.556
go to this terminal,

1762
00:35:15.556 --> 00:35:16.277
I'm gonna clear it,

1763
00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:17.536
right? Even though this

1764
00:35:17.536 --> 00:35:18.876
will probably be somewhat

1765
00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:19.655
useful to have the

1766
00:35:19.655 --> 00:35:20.416
context of it being

1767
00:35:20.436 --> 00:35:22.195
built, always run fresh

1768
00:35:22.215 --> 00:35:22.896
agents is a good

1769
00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:23.976
practice and it moves

1770
00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:25.494
you toward true off

1771
00:35:25.494 --> 00:35:26.594
device Agentic coding where

1772
00:35:26.594 --> 00:35:27.934
you're gonna have multiple

1773
00:35:27.934 --> 00:35:29.655
agents picking up context,

1774
00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:30.614
picking up work from
