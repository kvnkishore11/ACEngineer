00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:00.406
You probably opened the

121
00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.245
browser and clicked through

122
00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:03.984
your new feature. What

123
00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:04.843
a waste of

124
00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:08.097
time, okay? These are

125
00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:10.111
all feedback loops. Let

126
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:10.711
me explain why this

127
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:11.169
is a waste of

128
00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.228
time, okay? These are

129
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:13.638
things that you and

130
00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:14.396
I will do less

131
00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:15.496
and less and less

132
00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:16.635
as we scale our

133
00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.215
agentic systems. These are

134
00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.394
all feedback loops you

135
00:03:19.394 --> 00:03:20.552
can now hand off

136
00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.092
to your agents. This

137
00:03:22.092 --> 00:03:22.830
is all work you

138
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.911
don't have to do

139
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:25.370
anymore, but likely still

140
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.209
are. Why are we

141
00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.968
still doing this work?

142
00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:28.388
It's because we're missing

143
00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.225
testing as a critical
