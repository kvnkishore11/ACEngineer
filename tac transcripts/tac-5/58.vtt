1435
00:28:59.013 --> 00:29:00.053
by our agent. We

1436
00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:01.751
have validation commands, right?

1437
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.410
So with every plan

1438
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.548
we build, with every

1439
00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:05.847
bug we solve, with

1440
00:29:05.887 --> 00:29:07.806
every feature we build,

1441
00:29:08.354 --> 00:29:08.913
we are going to

1442
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:11.092
have validation commands baked

1443
00:29:11.172 --> 00:29:12.510
in by default. Okay.

1444
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.789
When we talk about

1445
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:15.627
scaling our impact with

1446
00:29:15.768 --> 00:29:17.067
Agentic coding, when we

1447
00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:18.405
talk about always adding

1448
00:29:18.405 --> 00:29:19.486
feedback loops, I mean

1449
00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:21.023
it always add feedback

1450
00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:21.624
loops and you can

1451
00:29:21.624 --> 00:29:22.423
do this. You know,

1452
00:29:22.423 --> 00:29:23.123
this isn't a huge

1453
00:29:23.123 --> 00:29:24.901
cumbersome task. You encode

1454
00:29:24.901 --> 00:29:26.040
it, you template your

1455
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.699
engineering into your reusable

1456
00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:28.738
prompts so that your

1457
00:29:28.738 --> 00:29:29.990
agents can pick up

1458
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.729
on the work and
