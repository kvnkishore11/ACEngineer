1408
00:28:29.478 --> 00:28:30.356
we'll run this prompt.

1409
00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:31.576
Basically, I'm just describing

1410
00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.155
this at a high

1411
00:28:32.155 --> 00:28:33.474
level. Then our bug

1412
00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:34.075
meta prompt is gonna

1413
00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:34.834
pick this up, it's

1414
00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:35.513
gonna create a plan

1415
00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:36.452
for us, okay? What

1416
00:28:36.452 --> 00:28:37.311
have we done here

1417
00:28:37.311 --> 00:28:38.351
with this bug plan,

1418
00:28:38.351 --> 00:28:39.010
right? Because we had

1419
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.869
this before, how have

1420
00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:41.989
we improved this? So

1421
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.087
a couple things, you

1422
00:28:43.087 --> 00:28:44.047
may have noticed even

1423
00:28:44.047 --> 00:28:45.665
before in our previous

1424
00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:46.346
lesson, If you look

1425
00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:47.384
at the plan format,

1426
00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:48.942
the template that our

1427
00:28:48.942 --> 00:28:49.902
agent is filling out

1428
00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:50.642
for us, if we

1429
00:28:50.642 --> 00:28:52.079
scroll down here, you

1430
00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:52.799
can see we have

1431
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.778
validation commands and you'll

1432
00:28:54.778 --> 00:28:55.896
notice something here. It's

1433
00:28:55.896 --> 00:28:57.474
templated in to the

1434
00:28:57.474 --> 00:28:59.013
plans that get generated

1435
00:28:59.013 --> 00:29:00.053
by our agent. We
