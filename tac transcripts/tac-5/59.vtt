1458
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.729
on the work and

1459
00:29:30.729 --> 00:29:31.509
build the way you

1460
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:32.548
want to build over

1461
00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:33.008
and over and over.

1462
00:29:33.008 --> 00:29:33.407
And the way you

1463
00:29:33.407 --> 00:29:34.208
want to build is

1464
00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:35.547
with high confidence. You

1465
00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:36.366
want to know that

1466
00:29:36.366 --> 00:29:37.566
the feature has shipped.

1467
00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:38.526
Okay. We also have

1468
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.404
another line in here,

1469
00:29:39.424 --> 00:29:40.805
right? A template inside

1470
00:29:40.805 --> 00:29:41.523
of the prompt. If

1471
00:29:41.523 --> 00:29:42.144
you create an end

1472
00:29:42.144 --> 00:29:43.243
to end test, include

1473
00:29:43.243 --> 00:29:44.942
the following validation steps.

1474
00:29:44.962 --> 00:29:45.542
So we're just saying,

1475
00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:46.682
you know, specifically add

1476
00:29:46.682 --> 00:29:48.340
this in addition to

1477
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.520
all the other validation

1478
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.940
commands that you'll use

1479
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.459
to validate with 100%

1480
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:53.459
confidence, right? We're just

1481
00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:54.538
doing some prompting here

1482
00:29:54.538 --> 00:29:55.357
that the issue has

1483
00:29:55.357 --> 00:29:56.416
been fixed with no

1484
00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:57.757
regressions. All right. So

1485
00:29:57.757 --> 00:29:58.655
super powerful stuff here.

1486
00:29:58.655 --> 00:29:59.395
You can see our

1487
00:29:59.395 --> 00:29:59.836
agent is It's still

1488
00:29:59.836 --> 00:30:00.816
running, it's looking for
