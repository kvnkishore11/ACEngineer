165
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.264
agents validating your entire

166
00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:02.842
codebase with regression

167
00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.102
tests and most importantly

168
00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:05.540
with end-to-end tests. I'm

169
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.099
not saying stop testing

170
00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.399
or stop reviewing. I'm

171
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.978
saying start handing off

172
00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:11.796
this responsibility and start

173
00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:13.395
teaching your agents to

174
00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:14.474
test. Why should we

175
00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:15.094
do that? Why should

176
00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:16.430
we hand off more

177
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.168
to our agents. Of

178
00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.149
course, when you do

179
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.966
this, you create closed

180
00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.946
loop feedback systems where

181
00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.305
your agent can execute,

182
00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:25.223
validate, and reflect on

183
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.343
the work done in

184
00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:27.702
a loop until the

185
00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.062
job is done. By

186
00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:30.120
teaching your agents to
