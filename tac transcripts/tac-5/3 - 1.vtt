00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.340
automating tests and review

55
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.900
workflows that would otherwise

56
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.718
cost your time and

57
00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:35.759
attention. All you have

58
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.117
to do is answer

59
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:38.980
this one question. Given

60
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.118
a unit of valuable

61
00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:41.658
work that's production ready,

62
00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:42.816
how would you, the

63
00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.814
engineer, test and validate

64
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:45.873
this work? If you

65
00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:46.972
can answer this question

66
00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.272
for every class of

67
00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:49.311
work that your code

68
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.730
base handles and then

69
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.447
encode the answers into

70
00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:53.468
a command or tool

71
00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:55.165
call, you will fly

72
00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:56.956
while other engineers run.

73
00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:58.475
It's that simple. And

74
00:01:58.495 --> 00:01:59.875
depending on your staging

75
00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.334
and production system, it's
