233
00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:30.932
this, you let the

234
00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:32.432
code write itself. You

235
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.771
let the agent operate

236
00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:35.192
with the right information

237
00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:36.310
so well that it

238
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.711
closes the loop. Now

239
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:38.930
with testing, one of

240
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.970
the most heated debates

241
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.949
in the engineering world

242
00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:41.829
has come to an

243
00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.447
end. Now engineers that

244
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.927
test with their agents

245
00:05:45.127 --> 00:05:46.947
win. Full stop, zero

246
00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:48.286
exceptions. This is because

247
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.485
the value of tests

248
00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:50.564
are multiplied by the

249
00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:52.723
number of agent executions

250
00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:53.663
that occur in your

251
00:05:53.663 --> 00:05:54.963
codebase. Testing is

252
00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:55.802
one of the highest

253
00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:57.663
through agent leverage points

254
00:05:57.862 --> 00:05:59.221
of Agentic coding, you

255
00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:00.360
can use. Why is
