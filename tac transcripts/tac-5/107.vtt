2681
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.608
bases grow. They evolve.

2682
00:53:31.728 --> 00:53:32.807
As we add features,

2683
00:53:32.807 --> 00:53:33.487
we need to update

2684
00:53:33.507 --> 00:53:35.126
documentation. And as we

2685
00:53:35.126 --> 00:53:36.005
ship, we need to

2686
00:53:36.005 --> 00:53:38.222
review the work completely.

2687
00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:39.103
We've already taken a

2688
00:53:39.123 --> 00:53:40.340
big step into that.

2689
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.141
In the next lesson,

2690
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:42.300
we continue it and

2691
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.597
we automate the software

2692
00:53:43.597 --> 00:53:45.356
developer lifecycle end to

2693
00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:46.295
end. We're giving our

2694
00:53:46.295 --> 00:53:48.153
agents full control over

2695
00:53:48.153 --> 00:53:48.972
the codebase. Great

2696
00:53:48.972 --> 00:53:49.952
work here. Take some

2697
00:53:49.952 --> 00:53:50.911
time to digest these

2698
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:52.090
ideas and I'll see

2699
00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:53.449
you in Lesson 6.
