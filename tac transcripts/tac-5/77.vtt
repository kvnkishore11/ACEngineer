1926
00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:30.210
then templated our engineering.

1927
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.550
So what comes next?

1928
00:38:31.713 --> 00:38:33.092
after this, right? After

1929
00:38:33.092 --> 00:38:33.972
you have a reusable

1930
00:38:33.972 --> 00:38:34.992
prompt, that's a meta

1931
00:38:34.992 --> 00:38:36.952
prompt, right? That generates

1932
00:38:36.952 --> 00:38:38.050
consistent results for you.

1933
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.951
You then wanna get

1934
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.710
off your device, right?

1935
00:38:40.869 --> 00:38:41.449
We need to get

1936
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.208
out the loop. It's

1937
00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:43.528
a key tactic of

1938
00:38:43.528 --> 00:38:45.507
Agentic coding, stay out

1939
00:38:45.547 --> 00:38:46.967
the loop. That's where

1940
00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:48.327
the ADWs come in,

1941
00:38:48.487 --> 00:38:49.186
all right? So you

1942
00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:50.146
can see here, lesson

1943
00:38:50.146 --> 00:38:51.626
by lesson, we're improving

1944
00:38:52.045 --> 00:38:53.465
the Agentic layer around

1945
00:38:53.465 --> 00:38:54.923
our codebase. And,

1946
00:38:54.983 --> 00:38:56.043
you know, let's highlight

1947
00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:57.422
the files that really

1948
00:38:57.422 --> 00:38:58.342
make that up, right?

1949
00:38:58.342 --> 00:39:00.322
The directories, that make
