2566
00:50:58.617 --> 00:51:00.137
moving fast. We're building

2567
00:51:00.137 --> 00:51:01.996
up this powerful Agentic

2568
00:51:01.996 --> 00:51:03.434
layer around our code

2569
00:51:03.434 --> 00:51:04.494
base. There's a lot

2570
00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:05.454
going on here. In

2571
00:51:05.454 --> 00:51:07.233
lesson six, we conclude

2572
00:51:07.353 --> 00:51:08.753
our epic journey to

2573
00:51:08.753 --> 00:51:11.012
automate this software developer

2574
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.351
lifecycle. We are almost

2575
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:13.289
there. We need two

2576
00:51:13.289 --> 00:51:14.570
more key steps. We

2577
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.728
need the review step

2578
00:51:15.728 --> 00:51:17.009
and the document step.

2579
00:51:17.028 --> 00:51:17.728
Along the way, we're

2580
00:51:17.728 --> 00:51:18.827
going to clarify and

2581
00:51:18.827 --> 00:51:20.407
really walk through what

2582
00:51:20.407 --> 00:51:21.925
a complete Agentic layer

2583
00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:23.025
around our codebase

2584
00:51:23.025 --> 00:51:23.746
looks like. We have

2585
00:51:23.766 --> 00:51:25.065
all the foundations. We

2586
00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:25.965
have all the big

2587
00:51:26.063 --> 00:51:27.483
heavy hitting ideas. from

2588
00:51:27.483 --> 00:51:28.682
high level prompts, low

2589
00:51:28.682 --> 00:51:31.061
level prompts, plans, templates,
