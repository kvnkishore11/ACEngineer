560
00:11:59.547 --> 00:12:00.427
for my agents. I

561
00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:01.653
can close this. I

562
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:02.494
can open up code

563
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:03.072
and you can see

564
00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:04.273
here we are listening

565
00:12:04.273 --> 00:12:05.672
to our GitHub web

566
00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:06.711
hooks. This is the

567
00:12:06.711 --> 00:12:07.730
trigger that's going to

568
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.811
kick off this agentic

569
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.029
workflow once the prompt

570
00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.250
input comes in. Let's

571
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:11.548
go ahead and kick

572
00:12:11.548 --> 00:12:12.568
this off. And then

573
00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:13.009
you're going to see

574
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:14.447
this kickoff as that

575
00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:15.408
web hook event comes

576
00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:16.486
in. There it is.

577
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:17.226
There's a lot of

578
00:12:17.226 --> 00:12:17.706
work that's going to

579
00:12:17.706 --> 00:12:19.346
happen here in the

580
00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.445
background. You can see

581
00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:21.164
our agents getting to

582
00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:21.825
work there. We've made

583
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.063
some improvements. We'll get

584
00:12:23.063 --> 00:12:23.864
around to these. This

585
00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:24.302
is going to be

586
00:12:24.302 --> 00:12:25.202
a long running Outlook

587
00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:26.102
job. We're going to

588
00:12:26.102 --> 00:12:27.562
have a slew of

589
00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:30.201
chained together agents operating.
