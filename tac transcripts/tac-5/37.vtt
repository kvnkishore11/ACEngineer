00:18:29.468 --> 00:18:30.327
depending on the type

904
00:18:30.347 --> 00:18:31.307
of codebase that

905
00:18:31.307 --> 00:18:32.307
you're operating on your

906
00:18:32.307 --> 00:18:33.866
language the problem set

907
00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:34.866
you're tackling and the

908
00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:35.606
way your codebase

909
00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:36.726
is architected but the

910
00:18:36.726 --> 00:18:38.145
ideas are the same

911
00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:39.385
you can provide feedback

912
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.089
your agents inside of

913
00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:42.490
your agentic prompts by

914
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.669
giving it feedback and

915
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:44.949
by following this three-step

916
00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:47.308
framework for writing closed

917
00:18:47.449 --> 00:18:49.708
loop prompts there's a

918
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:50.867
request usually these are

919
00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:51.228
going to be a

920
00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:52.867
large spec or large

921
00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:53.988
task or feature you

922
00:18:53.988 --> 00:18:54.647
want built and then

923
00:18:54.647 --> 00:18:55.288
you're going to have

924
00:18:55.587 --> 00:18:57.846
validations all right validators

925
00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:58.426
and then give some

926
00:18:58.426 --> 00:19:00.707
direction with your resolution
