1356
00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:30.178
right, so we covered

1357
00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:31.137
this in our previous

1358
00:27:31.137 --> 00:27:32.881
lessons. If we collapse

1359
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:33.760
everything here, you can

1360
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.300
see all of the

1361
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.599
sections and the key

1362
00:27:35.599 --> 00:27:36.699
part is just the

1363
00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:37.358
top. This is a

1364
00:27:37.358 --> 00:27:38.298
meta prompt. It's a

1365
00:27:38.298 --> 00:27:39.376
prompt that creates a

1366
00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:41.276
prompt. We're templating our

1367
00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:43.234
engineering into some key

1368
00:27:43.275 --> 00:27:44.394
reusable prompts into the

1369
00:27:44.394 --> 00:27:45.472
codebase so that

1370
00:27:45.472 --> 00:27:46.492
we can solve problems

1371
00:27:46.593 --> 00:27:48.451
very quickly like this.

1372
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:49.391
So let's hop back

1373
00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:50.450
to that instance. Let's

1374
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.470
clear. We always want

1375
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.048
fresh agent instances. We

1376
00:27:53.048 --> 00:27:54.607
don't want any context

1377
00:27:54.728 --> 00:27:55.807
pollution and then I'll

1378
00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:58.425
run slash bug. And

1379
00:27:58.585 --> 00:27:58.984
let's look at the

1380
00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:00.304
variables that this prompt
