2368
00:46:58.056 --> 00:47:00.282
one test failure. And

2369
00:47:00.282 --> 00:47:01.601
it looks like, so

2370
00:47:01.601 --> 00:47:02.161
we got a lot

2371
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.480
of great tests completed.

2372
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.978
Test complex query. We

2373
00:47:04.978 --> 00:47:05.539
got a Claude Code

2374
00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:06.597
error. This is probably

2375
00:47:06.597 --> 00:47:08.097
a API error. Okay,

2376
00:47:08.097 --> 00:47:08.476
so this is a

2377
00:47:08.476 --> 00:47:10.215
Claude Code internal error,

2378
00:47:10.215 --> 00:47:10.876
which of course will

2379
00:47:10.876 --> 00:47:11.994
break the tests. Everything

2380
00:47:11.994 --> 00:47:12.675
needs to run on

2381
00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:13.893
Claude Code here. And

2382
00:47:13.893 --> 00:47:14.652
if we want to,

2383
00:47:14.652 --> 00:47:15.592
we can always dig

2384
00:47:15.592 --> 00:47:16.791
into the logs to

2385
00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:17.711
validate. I'll bet this

2386
00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:20.050
was a overloaded API

2387
00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:21.130
error on the Anthropic

2388
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:21.969
side. Let me just

2389
00:47:21.989 --> 00:47:22.648
go ahead and confirm

2390
00:47:22.648 --> 00:47:23.268
that. We can dig

2391
00:47:23.268 --> 00:47:23.987
into the logs here.

2392
00:47:23.987 --> 00:47:24.307
This will be a

2393
00:47:24.307 --> 00:47:25.507
good exercise as well.

2394
00:47:25.527 --> 00:47:26.525
Let's go into our

2395
00:47:26.525 --> 00:47:28.445
agent box. and let's

2396
00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:29.766
look up that exact

2397
00:47:29.885 --> 00:47:32.485
ADW ID right here.
