829
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.149
validate SQL query has

830
00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:01.948
been commented out. I

831
00:17:01.948 --> 00:17:03.427
need to uncomment this

832
00:17:03.548 --> 00:17:04.347
and call a function.

833
00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:05.106
So there's that import

834
00:17:05.106 --> 00:17:06.386
coming back in and

835
00:17:06.386 --> 00:17:07.425
there's that comment getting

836
00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:09.045
resolved. So without knowing

837
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:10.284
what we previously did,

838
00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:11.144
right, thanks to the

839
00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:12.623
context window clearing, it

840
00:17:12.623 --> 00:17:13.542
fixed this issue and

841
00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:14.342
made sure that all

842
00:17:14.342 --> 00:17:15.461
the pie tests ran.

843
00:17:15.461 --> 00:17:16.461
And this is important.

844
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:16.980
You have to make

845
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.819
a rule inside of

846
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:18.880
your codebased architecture.

847
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.858
What's more important, the

848
00:17:19.858 --> 00:17:21.098
code or your tests?

849
00:17:21.317 --> 00:17:22.737
The answer should be

850
00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.276
your tests. Your tests

851
00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:25.515
should be the rule

852
00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:26.682
of law in your

853
00:17:26.682 --> 00:17:27.861
codebase. If your

854
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.859
tests aren't right, focus

855
00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:29.759
on having your agents

856
00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:30.759
update the test so
