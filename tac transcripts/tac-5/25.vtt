589
00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:30.201
chained together agents operating.

590
00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:31.600
They're going to build

591
00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:33.099
plan and test. So

592
00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:34.178
we'll go ahead, minimize

593
00:12:34.178 --> 00:12:34.918
this, let it do

594
00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:35.778
its job. You can

595
00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:36.856
see our agents messages

596
00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:37.777
starting to trickle in.

597
00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:38.936
We made some enhancements.

598
00:12:38.936 --> 00:12:40.034
Again, we'll cover this

599
00:12:40.034 --> 00:12:41.075
as it's working out.

600
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:42.313
It's building the implementation

601
00:12:42.313 --> 00:12:43.114
plan. Now with the

602
00:12:43.114 --> 00:12:44.373
planner, let's let it

603
00:12:44.373 --> 00:12:45.052
do its thing. So

604
00:12:45.052 --> 00:12:46.451
while our plan build

605
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.951
test agent system is

606
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:49.470
running in the AI

607
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:51.068
developer workflow plan build

608
00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:52.109
test, let's go ahead

609
00:12:52.109 --> 00:12:53.148
and work up to

610
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.947
the work that's happening

611
00:12:54.947 --> 00:12:56.086
in that Outlook system.

612
00:12:56.287 --> 00:12:57.086
All right, here we

613
00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:58.304
are. We have just

614
00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.263
primed an agent and
