11
00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:30.532
can operate on our

12
00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:31.989
behalf. To get there,

13
00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:33.645
We need two things,

14
00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.185
a framework that won't

15
00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:36.844
change over time and

16
00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:38.463
a tactic that shifts

17
00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.002
how we engineer from

18
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:41.661
AI coding to agentic

19
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:42.701
coding so we can

20
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.399
maximize not what we

21
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.420
can do, but what

22
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.518
our agents can do.

23
00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:47.439
Just like with AI

24
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.198
coding, Agentic Coding is

25
00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:50.557
easy to start, hard

26
00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:51.856
to master. All the

27
00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.155
low hanging fruit is

28
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:54.295
getting chewed up. It's

29
00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:54.914
time to do the

30
00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.354
smart work, not the

31
00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:57.573
hard work to get

32
00:00:57.573 --> 00:00:59.673
asymmetric return on your

33
00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.351
engineering. It doesn't matter
