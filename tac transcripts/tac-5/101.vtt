WEBVTT

2544
00:50:28.226 --> 00:50:30.246
are generating plans with

2545
00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:31.784
Meta prompts. We've embedded

2546
00:50:31.784 --> 00:50:33.623
testing into our daily

2547
00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:34.702
work, right, into our

2548
00:50:34.702 --> 00:50:36.081
bug fixes, into our

2549
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:37.480
features, into our chores.

2550
00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:38.199
But then we pushed

2551
00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:39.838
it even further. into

2552
00:50:39.838 --> 00:50:40.657
ADWs, right? So we're

2553
00:50:40.657 --> 00:50:42.996
composing the 12 leverage

2554
00:50:43.034 --> 00:50:44.474
points of Agentic coding

2555
00:50:44.534 --> 00:50:45.233
step by step by

2556
00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:46.552
step. Even after you

2557
00:50:46.552 --> 00:50:48.192
have ADWs, you can

2558
00:50:48.192 --> 00:50:49.351
stack them together, of

2559
00:50:49.351 --> 00:50:50.829
course, to complete the

2560
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:52.829
software developer lifecycle and

2561
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:53.407
you can run them

2562
00:50:53.407 --> 00:50:54.688
in isolation to improve

2563
00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:56.326
them, right? So what's

2564
00:50:56.326 --> 00:50:58.057
next? right? We're doing

2565
00:50:58.057 --> 00:50:58.617
a lot here. We're

2566
00:50:58.617 --> 00:51:00.137
moving fast. We're building
