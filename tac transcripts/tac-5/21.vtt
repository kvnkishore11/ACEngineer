00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:30.794
If we look at

480
00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.745
our ADWs here, We

481
00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:34.325
have a new set

482
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.264
of ADWs we're gonna

483
00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:36.325
break down later. What

484
00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:37.124
we wanna do right

485
00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:38.104
now is just kick

486
00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.842

489
00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:42.322
point. You can see

490
00:10:42.322 --> 00:10:43.841
we've improved the application

491
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:45.240
structure. Right now, all

492
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.941
we wanna do is

493
00:10:45.941 --> 00:10:46.841

494
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.259
Outloop AFK agent using

495
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.418
the PIDA framework we
