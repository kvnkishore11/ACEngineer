1623
00:32:29.164 --> 00:32:31.163
UVPyTest, right? Testing that

1624
00:32:31.163 --> 00:32:32.962
specific file that had

1625
00:32:32.962 --> 00:32:34.123
the issue. We have

1626
00:32:34.242 --> 00:32:35.541
diff before and after

1627
00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:36.501
table. So it's actually

1628
00:32:36.501 --> 00:32:37.561
writing to standard out

1629
00:32:37.561 --> 00:32:38.901
before, after, then we

1630
00:32:38.921 --> 00:32:40.140
diff it, okay? And

1631
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.200
so these are all

1632
00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:43.739
validations, right? We've encoded

1633
00:32:43.838 --> 00:32:45.238
the act of validating

1634
00:32:45.238 --> 00:32:46.417
into our prompts. This

1635
00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:47.896
is very, very powerful.

1636
00:32:47.896 --> 00:32:49.537
When our agent inevitably

1637
00:32:49.537 --> 00:32:50.935
makes a mistake, its

1638
00:32:51.016 --> 00:32:52.694
validation command will create

1639
00:32:52.694 --> 00:32:54.494
a closed loop, several

1640
00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:55.374
closed loops, right? You

1641
00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:56.534
can see, We're testing

1642
00:32:56.534 --> 00:32:57.413
a multitude of things

1643
00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:58.771
here. It'll create a

1644
00:32:58.771 --> 00:33:00.391
closed feedback loop for
