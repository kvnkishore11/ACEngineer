717
00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:01.041
structure of this is

718
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:02.080
very important. This is

719
00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.318
unlike a standard prompt.

720
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:05.538
This prompt instructs the

721
00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:07.116
agent to validate itself.

722
00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:08.676
It creates a small

723
00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:10.674
loop system. Okay. So

724
00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:11.453
let's scale this up

725
00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.533
and let's add another

726
00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:13.633
feedback loop. Right. So

727
00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:14.273
I'm going to run

728
00:15:14.273 --> 00:15:14.991
slash clear here. Let's

729
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:16.351
replace this prompt here

730
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:17.370
with an updated prompt.

731
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:17.831
We're going to update

732
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:19.070
the server file, remove,

733
00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:20.216
the insights endpoint. So

734
00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:21.096
if we go here,

735
00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:22.054
if we collapse everything

736
00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:22.953
here, we have this

737
00:15:23.073 --> 00:15:24.552
unused import here. Let

738
00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:24.851
me go ahead and

739
00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:26.291
collapse even further. We

740
00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:27.210
have this insights right

741
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:27.828
here. And so this

742
00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:28.568
is not being used.

743
00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:29.087
We want to get

744
00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:29.628
rid of this. And

745
00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:30.246
then we're going to
