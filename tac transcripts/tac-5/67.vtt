WEBVTT

1669
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:30.411
right, so now our

1670
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:31.351
plan is going to

1671
00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:32.349
get implemented here. And

1672
00:33:32.349 --> 00:33:32.888
if we open up

1673
00:33:32.888 --> 00:33:34.547
that implement command, we've

1674
00:33:34.547 --> 00:33:35.086
looked at this in

1675
00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:36.518
previous videos. This is

1676
00:33:36.518 --> 00:33:37.856
a higher order prompt

1677
00:33:37.856 --> 00:33:38.997
that takes a plan

1678
00:33:38.997 --> 00:33:40.375
in as an argument

1679
00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:41.256
and then has a

1680
00:33:41.256 --> 00:33:42.875
couple instructions around the

1681
00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:43.973
plan. All right. So

1682
00:33:43.973 --> 00:33:45.473
that's that this engineering

1683
00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:46.173
resource is now going

1684
00:33:46.173 --> 00:33:46.913
to get kicked off

1685
00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:48.531
and create the solution

1686
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:49.531
for us. So let's

1687
00:33:49.531 --> 00:33:50.510
look at our input

1688
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.711
debounce. And what I

1689
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:52.310
want to point out

1690
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.710
here is the difference

1691
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:54.630
between these two plans,

1692
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.929
right? Because we've template

1693
00:33:55.929 --> 00:33:57.067
or engineering and we've

1694
00:33:57.087 --> 00:33:59.146
added feedback loops into

1695
00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:00.027
the templates. We can
