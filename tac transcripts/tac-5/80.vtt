2000
00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:01.367
run slash feature or

2001
00:40:01.367 --> 00:40:02.867
slash bug. And so

2002
00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:03.686
that's the plan step.

2003
00:40:03.686 --> 00:40:04.706
The build then takes

2004
00:40:04.706 --> 00:40:06.085
the plan and actually

2005
00:40:06.106 --> 00:40:07.465
implements. Okay, right. So

2006
00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:08.905
this runs our slash

2007
00:40:09.025 --> 00:40:10.244
implement with a path

2008
00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:12.025
to our plan. And

2009
00:40:12.025 --> 00:40:13.284
then ADW test does

2010
00:40:13.284 --> 00:40:14.664
a few things. It

2011
00:40:14.664 --> 00:40:15.844
runs a different type

2012
00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:16.842
of Agentic workflow. Let's

2013
00:40:16.842 --> 00:40:17.802
go ahead and collapse

2014
00:40:17.862 --> 00:40:18.282
and let's go ahead

2015
00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.222
and walk through the

2016
00:40:19.222 --> 00:40:21.342
key elements of this.

2017
00:40:21.442 --> 00:40:22.021
just at a high

2018
00:40:22.021 --> 00:40:23.277
level. Let's walk through

2019
00:40:23.277 --> 00:40:24.733
the main of the

2020
00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:26.672
AI developer workflow for

2021
00:40:26.672 --> 00:40:27.853
testing. Of course, you

2022
00:40:27.853 --> 00:40:28.612
can run this on

2023
00:40:28.612 --> 00:40:29.452
your device. It'll run

2024
00:40:29.452 --> 00:40:30.291
the entire workflow. But
