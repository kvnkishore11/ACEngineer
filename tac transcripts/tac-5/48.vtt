1187
00:23:56.801 --> 00:24:00.465
right? Fantastic. So, you

1188
00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:01.525
know, our agent is

1189
00:24:01.644 --> 00:24:03.284
literally doing work that

1190
00:24:03.284 --> 00:24:04.023
we would do to

1191
00:24:04.023 --> 00:24:05.403
validate. And of course,

1192
00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:06.282
I know, I know

1193
00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:07.281
this application is super

1194
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.101
simple. It's minimal, right?

1195
00:24:09.101 --> 00:24:10.260
It's very easy to

1196
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.539
prompt what exactly to

1197
00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:12.200
do. You know, there's

1198
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200
like five actions you

1199
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.699
can take on this

1200
00:24:13.699 --> 00:24:15.179
page, but don't let

1201
00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:16.157
that scare you away.

1202
00:24:16.157 --> 00:24:17.278
Don't let that deter

1203
00:24:17.278 --> 00:24:18.356
you. Let's be super,

1204
00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:19.257
super clear about what's

1205
00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:21.195
happening here. Our agent

1206
00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:23.434
has more agency with

1207
00:24:23.615 --> 00:24:26.073
self validating loops. Okay.

1208
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.553
If you ignore giving

1209
00:24:27.553 --> 00:24:29.392
your agents testing, if

1210
00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:30.432
You do not build
