00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:30.491
perspective. Your agent needs

130
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.129
the information, the tools,

131
00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.288
and the resources you

132
00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:34.407
would use to solve

133
00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:35.586
the problem at hand.

134
00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:36.227
Let me say that

135
00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:37.626
another way. Your agent

136
00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.544
needs your context, your

137
00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.223
model, your prompt, and

138
00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:42.901
your tools, the core

139
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:44.282
four this is what's

140
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:45.222
so special about the

141
00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:46.381
core four it lets

142
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:48.161
your agent operate just

143
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.721
like you reliable tool

144
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:51.639
calling agentic behavior and

145
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.479
intelligence are no longer

146
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.340
limitations thanks to modern

147
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.239
llms and agents like

148
00:03:57.258 --> 00:03:59.218
clog code by consistently

149
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:00.838
adopting your agent's perspective
