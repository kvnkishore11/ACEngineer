2495
00:49:29.338 --> 00:49:30.536
this environment all on

2496
00:49:30.536 --> 00:49:30.876
its own. So if

2497
00:49:30.876 --> 00:49:31.996
we open up the

2498
00:49:31.996 --> 00:49:32.876
application, you can see

2499
00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:33.596
we have that new

2500
00:49:33.635 --> 00:49:35.175
feature generate random query.

2501
00:49:35.175 --> 00:49:36.054
If we click this,

2502
00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:37.333
we have the work

2503
00:49:37.353 --> 00:49:38.733
completed, right? You see

2504
00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:39.952
the loading state has

2505
00:49:39.952 --> 00:49:40.831
the button a little

2506
00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:42.389
off to some additional

2507
00:49:42.389 --> 00:49:43.250
testing steps would be

2508
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:44.208
good here to find

2509
00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:45.628
this, but it's doing

2510
00:49:45.628 --> 00:49:46.228
the work. We can

2511
00:49:46.228 --> 00:49:47.547
hit query. Let's go

2512
00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:48.467
ahead and see what

2513
00:49:48.467 --> 00:49:49.885
this generates for us.

2514
00:49:50.242 --> 00:49:51.860
And nice, so it

2515
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.880
generated quite a complex

2516
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.019
query there to give

2517
00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:55.139
this result. Obviously we

2518
00:49:55.139 --> 00:49:55.900
have test data here,

2519
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.300
so it's not gonna

2520
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.219
be super sharp, but

2521
00:49:57.219 --> 00:49:59.077
we can generate random

2522
00:49:59.077 --> 00:50:00.538
queries over and over
