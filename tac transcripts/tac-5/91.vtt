2289
00:45:29.907 --> 00:45:30.588
the top. And you

2290
00:45:30.588 --> 00:45:31.527
can see several different

2291
00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:32.547
agents that run in

2292
00:45:32.547 --> 00:45:33.586
this workflow. So, you

2293
00:45:33.586 --> 00:45:34.507
know, previously we looked

2294
00:45:34.507 --> 00:45:35.565
at our plan and

2295
00:45:35.565 --> 00:45:36.525
build step. We now

2296
00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:38.106
have, you know, multiple

2297
00:45:38.106 --> 00:45:38.945
different files that we

2298
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.184
can run and compose

2299
00:45:40.184 --> 00:45:41.523
together so that our

2300
00:45:41.623 --> 00:45:43.222
loops are isolated. And

2301
00:45:43.222 --> 00:45:44.061
this is powerful because

2302
00:45:44.061 --> 00:45:44.501
we want to be

2303
00:45:44.501 --> 00:45:45.541
able to tap in

2304
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:47.320
to one node of

2305
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.679
the software developer lifecycle

2306
00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:49.878
and improve that one

2307
00:45:49.898 --> 00:45:50.958
node. So we have

2308
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.396
plan, we have build,

2309
00:45:52.697 --> 00:45:53.677
we have test, and

2310
00:45:53.677 --> 00:45:54.735
of course we have

2311
00:45:54.735 --> 00:45:56.315
the compositions. So there's

2312
00:45:56.335 --> 00:45:57.514
ADW plan and here's

2313
00:45:57.534 --> 00:45:58.998
ADW plan. build, right?

2314
00:45:58.998 --> 00:45:59.856
So in this workflow,

2315
00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:00.757
we just fire off
