2657
00:52:59.215 --> 00:53:00.835
be complex or intricate.

2658
00:53:00.934 --> 00:53:02.034
Everything starts with a

2659
00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:03.702
single prompt. All right.

2660
00:53:03.702 --> 00:53:04.621
And everything starts in

2661
00:53:04.621 --> 00:53:05.561
the loop and then

2662
00:53:05.561 --> 00:53:06.679
slowly move it out

2663
00:53:06.679 --> 00:53:07.719
the loop. Get yourself

2664
00:53:07.719 --> 00:53:09.438
a dedicated environment so

2665
00:53:09.438 --> 00:53:10.378
that you can operate

2666
00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:11.557
out the loop. We're

2667
00:53:11.557 --> 00:53:12.878
rolling. We're making progress.

2668
00:53:12.878 --> 00:53:13.737
I'll see you in

2669
00:53:13.737 --> 00:53:15.097
lesson six where we

2670
00:53:15.097 --> 00:53:16.195
close the loop on

2671
00:53:16.195 --> 00:53:18.054
the software developer lifecycle.

2672
00:53:18.135 --> 00:53:19.255
There we're going to

2673
00:53:19.255 --> 00:53:20.614
teach our agents how

2674
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:22.253
to not just build,

2675
00:53:22.253 --> 00:53:23.472
plan and test, net

2676
00:53:23.472 --> 00:53:25.072
new features and fixes

2677
00:53:25.072 --> 00:53:26.090
to your codebase,

2678
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.550
but we're going to

2679
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:27.351
show them how to

2680
00:53:27.351 --> 00:53:29.750
review and document. Code

2681
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.608
bases grow. They evolve.
