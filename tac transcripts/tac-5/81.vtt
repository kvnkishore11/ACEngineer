2024
00:40:29.452 --> 00:40:30.291
the entire workflow. But

2025
00:40:30.291 --> 00:40:31.331
the big idea, right,

2026
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:32.251
we are Agentic coding

2027
00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:32.750
and we want to

2028
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.630
get more work into

2029
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.869
our agents hands. The

2030
00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:35.389
idea is that we'll

2031
00:40:35.389 --> 00:40:36.507
run this off device

2032
00:40:36.507 --> 00:40:37.248
with a prompt we

2033
00:40:37.248 --> 00:40:37.927
kicked off at the

2034
00:40:37.927 --> 00:40:39.047
beginning of the lesson,

2035
00:40:39.146 --> 00:40:39.706
right? You can see

2036
00:40:39.706 --> 00:40:40.507
here, we take a

2037
00:40:40.507 --> 00:40:41.865
GitHub issue number and

2038
00:40:41.865 --> 00:40:43.585
an ADW ID so

2039
00:40:43.585 --> 00:40:44.465
that we can chain

2040
00:40:44.465 --> 00:40:45.943
together these AI developer

2041
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.342
workflows. We do some

2042
00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:48.202
setup. We set up

2043
00:40:48.202 --> 00:40:49.782
our new state variable.

2044
00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:51.101
We get the repo,

2045
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:51.501
right? And then it's

2046
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:52.021
just a bunch of

2047
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:53.201
setup work here, but

2048
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.369
the real work comes

2049
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:55.480
here. here, when we

2050
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.259
start running our test

2051
00:40:56.259 --> 00:40:56.858
suite, we're going to

2052
00:40:56.858 --> 00:40:58.498
run tests with resolution.

2053
00:40:58.797 --> 00:40:59.458
And so if we

2054
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:00.556
click into this, we
