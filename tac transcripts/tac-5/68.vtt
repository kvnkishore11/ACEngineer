1695
00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:00.027
the templates. We can

1696
00:34:00.027 --> 00:34:01.146
scroll down. We can

1697
00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:01.566
see we have this

1698
00:34:01.566 --> 00:34:02.846
new file. in our

1699
00:34:02.846 --> 00:34:05.023
solution for our disable

1700
00:34:05.023 --> 00:34:06.542
input debounce query. All

1701
00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:07.163
right, so when we

1702
00:34:07.163 --> 00:34:07.742
make a query, we

1703
00:34:07.742 --> 00:34:08.782
want to disable the

1704
00:34:08.782 --> 00:34:09.760
input field so you

1705
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.661
can't spam it, right?

1706
00:34:10.661 --> 00:34:11.460
This is a classic

1707
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.518
front end problem. This

1708
00:34:12.518 --> 00:34:13.059
is great. So we

1709
00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:14.057
have this end to

1710
00:34:14.057 --> 00:34:14.637
end test that's gonna

1711
00:34:14.637 --> 00:34:15.416
get built here as

1712
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:16.737
a new file. Everything

1713
00:34:16.777 --> 00:34:17.916
else is just changes

1714
00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:19.355
to existing files, okay?

1715
00:34:19.355 --> 00:34:20.134
And if we scroll

1716
00:34:20.134 --> 00:34:21.333
down here, one of

1717
00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:23.112
the tasks is create

1718
00:34:23.112 --> 00:34:24.052
end to end test,

1719
00:34:24.351 --> 00:34:25.030
right? So it's saying

1720
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.170
read this file and

1721
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.090
this file. and then

1722
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.288
create an end-to-end test.

1723
00:34:28.288 --> 00:34:28.827
And we're gonna dig

1724
00:34:28.827 --> 00:34:30.346
into what the end-to-end
