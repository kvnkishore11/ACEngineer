1380
00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:00.304
variables that this prompt

1381
00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:00.983
takes in. So we

1382
00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:01.942
need an issue number.

1383
00:28:02.163 --> 00:28:02.882
We'll just type one,

1384
00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:03.701
one, one here. We

1385
00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:05.220
need an ADW ID.

1386
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.000
This is running on

1387
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.838
its own. We're running

1388
00:28:06.878 --> 00:28:07.518
in the loop. So

1389
00:28:07.518 --> 00:28:08.977
there's no AI developer

1390
00:28:08.977 --> 00:28:10.215
workflow ID. We'll just

1391
00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:10.915
type ADW one, one,

1392
00:28:10.915 --> 00:28:12.234
one. And then we

1393
00:28:12.234 --> 00:28:13.932
need our actual prompt,

1394
00:28:13.932 --> 00:28:15.132
right? The issue that

1395
00:28:15.132 --> 00:28:16.071
gets passed in here.

1396
00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:16.830
We need to resolve

1397
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.411
this issue. We have

1398
00:28:17.411 --> 00:28:18.430
a couple of tests.

1399
00:28:18.786 --> 00:28:19.744
that are creating some

1400
00:28:19.744 --> 00:28:20.204
real junk data in

1401
00:28:20.204 --> 00:28:22.502
our production database, right?

1402
00:28:22.583 --> 00:28:23.323
We're running in SQL

1403
00:28:23.343 --> 00:28:24.021
lite, we can run

1404
00:28:24.021 --> 00:28:25.060
these in memory. Our

1405
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.980
tests shouldn't be operating

1406
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.939
in our quote unquote

1407
00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:29.417
live production database. So

1408
00:28:29.478 --> 00:28:30.356
we'll run this prompt.
