1949
00:38:58.342 --> 00:39:00.322
The directories, that make

1950
00:39:00.322 --> 00:39:01.300
up the Agentic layer

1951
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300
of our codebase.

1952
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.940
All right, let's highlight

1953
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.940
those here. And the

1954
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.998
most important one, right,

1955
00:39:04.998 --> 00:39:06.458
the highest leverage point,

1956
00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:08.097
the highest composition level

1957
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:08.918
is of course the

1958
00:39:08.918 --> 00:39:10.317
AI developer workflow. And

1959
00:39:10.317 --> 00:39:11.056
so we have this

1960
00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:13.014
ADW test workflow here.

1961
00:39:13.175 --> 00:39:13.795
This is going to

1962
00:39:13.795 --> 00:39:15.853
run a series of

1963
00:39:15.994 --> 00:39:17.213
prompts. And let's go

1964
00:39:17.213 --> 00:39:17.753
ahead and point out

1965
00:39:17.753 --> 00:39:19.032
the specific ones that

1966
00:39:19.032 --> 00:39:20.311
it runs. So our

1967
00:39:20.311 --> 00:39:21.971
ADW test does this.

1968
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.250
So it fetches a

1969
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.501
GitHub issue. Right. We

1970
00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:25.501
want to run this

1971
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:26.460
from outside the loop

1972
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.760
using the Peter framework.

1973
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.780
We have four elements

1974
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.280
of Outlook systems, prompt
