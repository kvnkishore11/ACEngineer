323
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:30.939
Remember, we want attempts

324
00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:32.399
down, we want size

325
00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.639
up, we want streak

326
00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:34.637
up, and we want

327
00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:36.158
our presence down. How

328
00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:37.237
do we accomplish this?

329
00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.757
With upfront investment into

330
00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:40.396
the new Agentic layer

331
00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:41.334
of our codebase.

332
00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:42.634
Remember, we want end-to-end

333
00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:44.074
agents, not good agents,

334
00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:45.093
not great agents. I

335
00:07:45.093 --> 00:07:45.692
mean, we don't want

336
00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:46.473
them in the loop,

337
00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:47.911
although there's many times

338
00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:48.432
where we still need

339
00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:48.971
to be in the

340
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.011
loop here as we're

341
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.130
building these systems out,

342
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.790
but we don't want

343
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.569
to stay here. We

344
00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:53.050
don't want to be

345
00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:54.769
babysitting our agents. We

346
00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:56.588
want work done agentically.

347
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:57.487
Let me show you

348
00:07:57.627 --> 00:07:59.028
why we always add

349
00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:00.528
feedback loops all right
