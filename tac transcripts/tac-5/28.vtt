670
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:00.071
just want to do

671
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:01.090
something kind of random

672
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.668
to showcase how the

673
00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:03.888
closed loop system can

674
00:14:03.888 --> 00:14:04.927
catch and resolve errors

675
00:14:05.206 --> 00:14:06.245
quickly. I'll copy the

676
00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.658
reference. I'll use the

677
00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:08.756
at symbol for Claude

678
00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:10.375
code to automatically know

679
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:10.956
and read in this

680
00:14:10.956 --> 00:14:12.294
file. I'll say comment

681
00:14:12.294 --> 00:14:14.173
out validation and then

682
00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.873
I'll say validate your

683
00:14:15.873 --> 00:14:17.652
work with. So notice

684
00:14:17.652 --> 00:14:18.870
the structure of this

685
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.149
simple closed loop prompt.

686
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.808
We have our request,

687
00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:24.847
we have our validation

688
00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:25.587
and then we have

689
00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:27.427
our resolution. All right,

690
00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:28.706
so I'll just copy

691
00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:29.313
this. And then I'll

692
00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:30.474
fire this off inside
