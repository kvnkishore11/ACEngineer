949
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:30.089
would. Right. Let's scale

950
00:19:30.089 --> 00:19:30.961
it up again. all

951
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.082
around slash clear just

952
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:33.240
to keep the agents

953
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.661
context window fresh. And

954
00:19:34.661 --> 00:19:35.559
now we're gonna run

955
00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:36.279
this prompt. So let

956
00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:37.079
me paste this and

957
00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:37.759
let's break this down

958
00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:38.719
a little bit. So

959
00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:39.618
we've now turned this

960
00:19:39.618 --> 00:19:41.278
into a full reusable

961
00:19:41.278 --> 00:19:42.377
prompt that our agent

962
00:19:42.377 --> 00:19:43.757
can run, okay? This

963
00:19:43.757 --> 00:19:44.277
has gone from a

964
00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:45.176
toy prompt, right? A

965
00:19:45.176 --> 00:19:46.115
toy high level prompt

966
00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:47.236
to now a mid-level

967
00:19:47.236 --> 00:19:48.575
reusable prompt that you

968
00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:49.335
would want to embed

969
00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:50.194
in your codebase.

970
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.294
All right, so how

971
00:19:51.294 --> 00:19:52.013
does this work? What

972
00:19:52.013 --> 00:19:52.733
does this look like?

973
00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:53.377
We have the purpose

974
00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:54.518
of the top validation,

975
00:19:54.758 --> 00:19:55.657
validate your work. You

976
00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:56.257
can see our same

977
00:19:56.257 --> 00:19:57.696
backend checks. I'm running

978
00:19:57.737 --> 00:19:58.957
a few front end

979
00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:00.176
validation checks here. If
