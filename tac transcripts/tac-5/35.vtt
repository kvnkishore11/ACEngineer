856
00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:30.759
update the test so

857
00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.038
that your testing commands

858
00:17:32.038 --> 00:17:33.457
have weight, right? If

859
00:17:33.457 --> 00:17:34.396
the tests aren't right,

860
00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:36.335
things must be changed.

861
00:17:36.335 --> 00:17:37.214
And there's our Python

862
00:17:37.214 --> 00:17:38.513
compile. These all work.

863
00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:40.292
We have three feedback

864
00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.471
loops that our agent

865
00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:42.871
is tapping into to

866
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:44.109
make sure that the

867
00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:45.409
codebase is running

868
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:47.167
properly. Okay. So we

869
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.307
saw there it fixed

870
00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:49.705
two issues, you know,

871
00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:50.924
and you're gonna see

872
00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:52.263
this, right? As the

873
00:17:52.263 --> 00:17:53.304
agents progress, as the

874
00:17:53.304 --> 00:17:55.042
models improve, we will

875
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:56.665
be the ones prompting

876
00:17:56.665 --> 00:17:57.425
the errors. We will

877
00:17:57.425 --> 00:17:58.444
be the ones asking

878
00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.285
for things that aren't

879
00:17:59.285 --> 00:18:01.104
quite correct. And these
