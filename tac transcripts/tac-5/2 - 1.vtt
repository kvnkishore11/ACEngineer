33
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.286
with a massive opportunity.

34
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:01.725
The opportunity to have

35
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:03.484
your agents test on

36
00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:04.822
your behalf like you

37
00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.621
never could at scales

38
00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:08.051
you never will achieve.

39
00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.468
This is the gift

40
00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.069
of generative AI. This

41
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.787
is the gift of

42
00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.647
the agent architecture. There

43
00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:14.807
is one question that

44
00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:15.906
guides this lesson that

45
00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:17.626
unlocks this opportunity for

46
00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:18.745
you. This question is

47
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.364
key to unlocking one

48
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:21.864
of the most powerful

49
00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:23.603
leverage points of Agentic

50
00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:25.162
coding. This leverage point

51
00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:26.221
gives your agents the

52
00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:27.762
ability to save you

53
00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:29.620
hundreds of hours by

54
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.340
automating tests and review
