00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.401
run your linter, you

98
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:31.920
might execute unit tests,

99
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.258
you'll run UI tests,

100
00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:34.717
maybe your CI CD,

101
00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:36.176
runs your integration tests,

102
00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:37.056
you likely build or

103
00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.056
compile your application. Maybe

104
00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.115
you look for specific

105
00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:41.835
log messages in Datadog

106
00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:43.074
to confirm your features

107
00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.054
live, or maybe you

108
00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:45.312
check Sentry to look

109
00:02:45.312 --> 00:02:46.293
for a lack of

110
00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:47.532
error messages. If you're

111
00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.811
training models or doing

112
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:50.191
data science work, maybe

113
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.310
you run a custom

114
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.408
evaluation that ranks your

115
00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:55.028
artifacts performance. And maybe

116
00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:56.068
you have an LLM

117
00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:57.068
as a judge workflow.

118
00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:57.787
And here's the big

119
00:02:57.787 --> 00:02:59.326
one for many engineers.

120
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:00.406
You probably opened the
