2153
00:42:59.764 --> 00:43:01.244
important. We can parallelize

2154
00:43:01.244 --> 00:43:01.684
this, we can do

2155
00:43:01.684 --> 00:43:02.503
a lot of things

2156
00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:04.063
here with the architecture

2157
00:43:04.143 --> 00:43:05.083
of our ADW. The

2158
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:06.181
key here is we

2159
00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.422
have a mechanism inside

2160
00:43:07.422 --> 00:43:08.460
the codebase to

2161
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.760
run our tests to

2162
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.500
run every test we

2163
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.300
have. And then to

2164
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.918
resolve the issues, right?

2165
00:43:12.918 --> 00:43:14.237
And it's isolated. It's

2166
00:43:14.237 --> 00:43:14.717
not part of the

2167
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:15.476
build. It's not part

2168
00:43:15.476 --> 00:43:16.177
of the plan. This

2169
00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:17.036
runs on its own

2170
00:43:17.255 --> 00:43:18.014
with its own set

2171
00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:18.755
of agents in its

2172
00:43:18.795 --> 00:43:21.432
own context windows. Okay.

2173
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.313
And so this is

2174
00:43:22.313 --> 00:43:23.012
why it's so important

2175
00:43:23.032 --> 00:43:23.911
to adopt our agent's

2176
00:43:23.911 --> 00:43:24.871
perspective. We want to

2177
00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:26.429
know what's inside of

2178
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.570
every agent at any

2179
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.268
time. And so we

2180
00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:29.369
have one more key

2181
00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:30.168
piece of this, of
