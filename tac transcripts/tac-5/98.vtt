2472
00:48:59.318 --> 00:49:01.257
detailed exactly what we

2473
00:49:01.257 --> 00:49:02.755
wanted, natural language query

2474
00:49:02.755 --> 00:49:05.393
button that generates interesting

2475
00:49:05.393 --> 00:49:06.313
queries. we can look

2476
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:07.612
at the files generated.

2477
00:49:07.731 --> 00:49:08.090
You can see it

2478
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.849
created a new end-to-end

2479
00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:11.246
test for us. And

2480
00:49:11.246 --> 00:49:12.726
we have file updates,

2481
00:49:12.726 --> 00:49:13.445
that looks great. We

2482
00:49:13.445 --> 00:49:14.364
have our spec, so

2483
00:49:14.364 --> 00:49:15.782
we're gonna review exactly

2484
00:49:15.842 --> 00:49:17.021
the plan that was

2485
00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:17.739
created, right? So you

2486
00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:18.958
can see the end-to-end

2487
00:49:18.958 --> 00:49:21.056
test is detailed here.

2488
00:49:21.235 --> 00:49:21.775
And so if we

2489
00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:23.501
open up our machine

2490
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:25.181
here, our dedicated agent

2491
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:26.340
environment, we can actually

2492
00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:26.980
do something really cool,

2493
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.338
right? It's operating this

2494
00:49:28.338 --> 00:49:29.297
codebase is operating

2495
00:49:29.338 --> 00:49:30.536
this environment all on
