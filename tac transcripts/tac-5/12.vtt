255
00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:00.360
can use. Why is

256
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.040
that? It's because it

257
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.278
lets your agent close

258
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.817
the loop and self-validate.

259
00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.036
It lets your agent

260
00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:06.514
know that the work

261
00:06:06.514 --> 00:06:08.233
was done right. This

262
00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:09.490
leverage point is so

263
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.689
important. It has an

264
00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.788
entire lesson to itself.

265
00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:13.307
All right. And this

266
00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:14.970
makes sense, right? If

267
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.769
your auth tests are

268
00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:16.668
passing, you can be

269
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.648
more confident your authentication

270
00:06:18.648 --> 00:06:19.966
system is working. If

271
00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.146
your UI tests for

272
00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:22.245
your chat support system

273
00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:23.185
are passing, you can

274
00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:24.264
be more confident that

275
00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:25.384
your chat support system

276
00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.204
is working. If your

277
00:06:26.204 --> 00:06:27.762
end-to-end tests on your

278
00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.341
staging environment are passing,

279
00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.380
you can be very
