1974
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.280
of Outlook systems, prompt

1975
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.278
input, trigger environment and

1976
00:39:32.278 --> 00:39:33.498
review system. And you

1977
00:39:33.498 --> 00:39:34.617
can see with this

1978
00:39:34.657 --> 00:39:35.856
ADW, we're tapping into

1979
00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:36.697
every one of those.

1980
00:39:36.697 --> 00:39:37.097
All right. So we

1981
00:39:37.097 --> 00:39:37.817
kick this off like

1982
00:39:37.817 --> 00:39:38.516
this. We're going to

1983
00:39:38.516 --> 00:39:39.556
fetch the issue. We're

1984
00:39:39.556 --> 00:39:40.235
going to run the

1985
00:39:40.235 --> 00:39:41.235
application test suite. We're

1986
00:39:41.235 --> 00:39:41.994
going to report the

1987
00:39:41.994 --> 00:39:42.994
results. We're going to

1988
00:39:42.994 --> 00:39:44.193
commit the results and

1989
00:39:44.193 --> 00:39:45.273
then push NPR. So

1990
00:39:45.273 --> 00:39:46.733
this workflow quite literally

1991
00:39:46.773 --> 00:39:48.251
test the application and

1992
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:49.692
fixes any issues. Okay.

1993
00:39:49.692 --> 00:39:50.791
And this is very

1994
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:52.210
powerful, right? It's completely

1995
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:53.329
separate from the build

1996
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.630
and plan step. If

1997
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.670
you remember the plan

1998
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.849
step creates our spec

1999
00:39:57.909 --> 00:39:59.369
slash tour or it'll

2000
00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:01.367
run slash feature or
