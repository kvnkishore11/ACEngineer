1597
00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:00.387
files right this is

1598
00:32:00.387 --> 00:32:02.467
a back-end specific change

1599
00:32:02.666 --> 00:32:03.605
so our if statement

1600
00:32:03.605 --> 00:32:04.826
here right to kick

1601
00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:05.424
off our end to

1602
00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:07.304
end playwright tests that

1603
00:32:07.304 --> 00:32:08.303
did not get activated

1604
00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:09.261
because our agent correctly

1605
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:10.442
identified the fact that

1606
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.441
this bug does not

1607
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:12.519
affect the UI. But

1608
00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:13.459
so in the generated

1609
00:32:13.459 --> 00:32:14.519
plan, we can search

1610
00:32:14.578 --> 00:32:15.498
through this. And if

1611
00:32:15.498 --> 00:32:16.336
we, you know, look,

1612
00:32:16.336 --> 00:32:17.415
here's all the step-by-step

1613
00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:18.615
play. But if we

1614
00:32:18.615 --> 00:32:19.255
come down here to

1615
00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:21.034
the bottom, the validation

1616
00:32:21.034 --> 00:32:22.192
commands, you can see

1617
00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:23.412
everything our agent will

1618
00:32:23.412 --> 00:32:25.030
do to validate that

1619
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.269
the bug was fixed.

1620
00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:26.865
All right, so we

1621
00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:27.944
have a couple SQLite

1622
00:32:27.944 --> 00:32:29.164
three runs. We have

1623
00:32:29.164 --> 00:32:31.163
UVPyTest, right? Testing that
