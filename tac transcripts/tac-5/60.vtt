1488
00:29:59.836 --> 00:30:00.816
running, it's looking for

1489
00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:01.755
this issue. It looks

1490
00:30:01.755 --> 00:30:03.015
like it's gonna find

1491
00:30:03.015 --> 00:30:04.193
it pretty soon here.

1492
00:30:04.193 --> 00:30:05.314
While we're doing this,

1493
00:30:05.354 --> 00:30:06.134
while this is running,

1494
00:30:06.233 --> 00:30:06.893
we have an agent

1495
00:30:06.893 --> 00:30:07.913
running here. We have

1496
00:30:07.913 --> 00:30:08.913
an agent running here.

1497
00:30:08.913 --> 00:30:10.832
Let's fire up another

1498
00:30:10.832 --> 00:30:12.211
issue that I noticed

1499
00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:12.691
that I wanted to

1500
00:30:12.691 --> 00:30:13.611
fix in this lesson.

1501
00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:14.971
When we run queries,

1502
00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:15.530
so if I say

1503
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.148
select five products, the

1504
00:30:19.148 --> 00:30:20.648
input field does not

1505
00:30:20.648 --> 00:30:21.588
get disabled. So you

1506
00:30:21.588 --> 00:30:22.627
could keep querying over

1507
00:30:22.627 --> 00:30:23.048
and over, right? This

1508
00:30:23.048 --> 00:30:23.768
is like a common

1509
00:30:23.768 --> 00:30:24.727
UI thing. This is

1510
00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:26.207
not something that you

1511
00:30:26.207 --> 00:30:27.067
or I need to

1512
00:30:27.067 --> 00:30:29.478
solve ever again. Right,

1513
00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:30.478
even with just a
