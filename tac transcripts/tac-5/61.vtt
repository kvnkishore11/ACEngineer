1513
00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:30.478
even with just a

1514
00:30:30.478 --> 00:30:31.797
simple in loop prompt,

1515
00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:32.336
we could fire that

1516
00:30:32.336 --> 00:30:32.876
off and it will

1517
00:30:32.876 --> 00:30:34.415
resolve this. But we

1518
00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:35.296
don't just wanna know

1519
00:30:35.296 --> 00:30:35.796
that the issue is

1520
00:30:35.796 --> 00:30:36.476
fixed, we wanna know

1521
00:30:36.476 --> 00:30:37.135
that the issue is

1522
00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.075
fixed and we want

1523
00:30:38.075 --> 00:30:38.714
our agent to be

1524
00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:40.414
confident about that. Okay,

1525
00:30:40.414 --> 00:30:40.874
so we can fire

1526
00:30:40.874 --> 00:30:42.173
off another agent here.

1527
00:30:42.422 --> 00:30:43.300
and we can have

1528
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.700
our agent fix that

1529
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.500
input issue. So I'm

1530
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.278
just gonna copy this

1531
00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:47.698
in here, bug, give

1532
00:30:47.698 --> 00:30:49.376
it an ID ADW222,

1533
00:30:49.376 --> 00:30:50.517
disable the input query

1534
00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:51.655
when the query is

1535
00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:52.434
running and add a

1536
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:53.494
debounce request, all right?

1537
00:30:53.515 --> 00:30:53.874
So we can fire

1538
00:30:53.874 --> 00:30:55.053
that off while our

1539
00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:55.873
other agent is working

1540
00:30:55.893 --> 00:30:56.492
for us. And let's

1541
00:30:56.492 --> 00:30:57.092
go ahead and see

1542
00:30:57.092 --> 00:30:57.932
if that test has

1543
00:30:57.932 --> 00:30:58.750
completed. There we go.

1544
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.570
So it's finished. So

1545
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.089
this is our plan
