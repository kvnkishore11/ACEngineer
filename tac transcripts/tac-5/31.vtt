WEBVTT

745
00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:30.246
then we're going to

746
00:15:30.246 --> 00:15:31.525
move our load and

747
00:15:31.525 --> 00:15:32.465
call to load on

748
00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.682
environment variables right before

749
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:34.423
it's import. So there's

750
00:15:34.423 --> 00:15:35.573
the request. And then

751
00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:37.173
here's our validation validate

752
00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:38.792
multiple things. So we're

753
00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:39.931
opening up a couple

754
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.831
loops here that our

755
00:15:40.831 --> 00:15:41.629
agent now has to

756
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:43.349
close. Okay. It needs

757
00:15:43.349 --> 00:15:44.349
to run these commands,

758
00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:45.508
look for errors. If

759
00:15:45.508 --> 00:15:46.548
there are resolve them.

760
00:15:46.548 --> 00:15:47.726
All right. So rough

761
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:48.785
py test and then

762
00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:50.764
a classic Python compile.

763
00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:51.524
Okay. Again, we're just

764
00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:52.744
going to copy this.

765
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:53.623
We have a new

766
00:15:53.643 --> 00:15:54.702
clear dot instance here.

767
00:15:54.702 --> 00:15:55.201
We're going to run

768
00:15:55.201 --> 00:15:56.261
this and let's see

769
00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:57.181
what our agent does.

770
00:15:57.181 --> 00:15:58.120
So we have a

771
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.759
linter, we have a

772
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.119
unit tester and we
