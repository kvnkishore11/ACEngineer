2419
00:47:59.244 --> 00:48:00.284
subsequent lessons, but let

2420
00:48:00.284 --> 00:48:01.384
me just quickly look

2421
00:48:01.384 --> 00:48:02.704
through this in our

2422
00:48:02.704 --> 00:48:03.724
agent sandbox here. I

2423
00:48:03.724 --> 00:48:05.684
just wanna confirm exactly

2424
00:48:05.684 --> 00:48:06.682
what this error was

2425
00:48:06.682 --> 00:48:08.422
here. Claude Code error,

2426
00:48:08.663 --> 00:48:12.342
test execution error. We

2427
00:48:12.342 --> 00:48:13.762
can hop into the

2428
00:48:13.762 --> 00:48:15.250
raw output and we

2429
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:16.369
can see exactly what

2430
00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:17.788
happened here. So if

2431
00:48:17.788 --> 00:48:18.827
we trace this log

2432
00:48:18.827 --> 00:48:19.606
right here, end to

2433
00:48:19.606 --> 00:48:20.527
end, we had a

2434
00:48:20.527 --> 00:48:22.005
test resolver run and

2435
00:48:22.005 --> 00:48:22.505
you can check this

2436
00:48:22.505 --> 00:48:24.603
out, API error 500.

2437
00:48:24.603 --> 00:48:25.264
So this is always

2438
00:48:25.264 --> 00:48:26.043
good to have, right?

2439
00:48:26.123 --> 00:48:26.523
You wanna be able

2440
00:48:26.523 --> 00:48:28.061
to trace everything right

2441
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:28.902
down to the nose.

2442
00:48:28.902 --> 00:48:29.621
You can see in

2443
00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:32.059
this ADW ID inside
