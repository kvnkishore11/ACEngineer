WEBVTT

1571
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:30.541
turned it into a

1572
00:31:30.601 --> 00:31:32.421
detailed low level spec.

1573
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.940
Great planning is indeed

1574
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.019
great prompting. And we

1575
00:31:35.019 --> 00:31:35.979
have a prompt to

1576
00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:37.758
automate writing great plans

1577
00:31:37.897 --> 00:31:38.857
for our codebase,

1578
00:31:38.857 --> 00:31:39.396
right? So it's very

1579
00:31:39.396 --> 00:31:41.076
specific. There's our reproduce

1580
00:31:41.096 --> 00:31:42.415
steps. And you should

1581
00:31:42.415 --> 00:31:43.155
be able to see

1582
00:31:43.155 --> 00:31:45.015
right our agent has

1583
00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:46.653
correctly identified that you

1584
00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:47.054
should be able to

1585
00:31:47.054 --> 00:31:47.554
just look at the

1586
00:31:47.554 --> 00:31:48.553
codebase and look

1587
00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.613
at the tables to

1588
00:31:49.613 --> 00:31:51.432
see these error tables

1589
00:31:51.432 --> 00:31:52.431
so our agent can

1590
00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:53.451
of course just execute

1591
00:31:53.451 --> 00:31:54.111
this you can see

1592
00:31:54.111 --> 00:31:55.109
no new files and

1593
00:31:55.109 --> 00:31:55.630
if we search end

1594
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:56.769
to end there isn't

1595
00:31:56.828 --> 00:31:58.628
any hint of the

1596
00:31:58.708 --> 00:31:59.528
these end to end

1597
00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:00.387
files right this is
