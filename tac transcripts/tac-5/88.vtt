2213
00:43:59.614 --> 00:44:00.773
do exactly what we

2214
00:44:00.773 --> 00:44:02.012
did in the beginning,

2215
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:03.492
right? Simple test here.

2216
00:44:03.492 --> 00:44:04.311
It's just gonna walk

2217
00:44:04.331 --> 00:44:07.128
through individual steps in

2218
00:44:07.128 --> 00:44:08.028
play, right? It's gonna

2219
00:44:08.028 --> 00:44:10.706
confirm results, verify things

2220
00:44:11.146 --> 00:44:12.445
and our top level

2221
00:44:12.802 --> 00:44:13.740
end to end test

2222
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.119
prompt takes in a

2223
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.378
slew of variables. It

2224
00:44:16.378 --> 00:44:18.518
has instructions. We're setting

2225
00:44:18.518 --> 00:44:19.157
some things up. So

2226
00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:20.476
we have some pre

2227
00:44:20.516 --> 00:44:21.576
conditioned commands we want

2228
00:44:21.596 --> 00:44:22.554
to run, right? Reset

2229
00:44:22.554 --> 00:44:24.373
DB, make sure everything's

2230
00:44:24.393 --> 00:44:25.193
running. And then we

2231
00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:26.271
have, you know, screenshot

2232
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:28.150
directory, some details about

2233
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.269
this port and then

2234
00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:30.469
the output formats. You
