399
00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.432
to also copy the

400
00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:01.893
environment variable from the

401
00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:03.211
tack four lesson. So

402
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.331
this copies both the

403
00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:05.831
app environment variable file

404
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.990
and the tack four

405
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.951
environment variable file. So

406
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.350
you can see that

407
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.130
just got copied in

408
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.169
there. That all looks

409
00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:11.289
great. Our agent is

410
00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:12.350
working on all this

411
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.328
code for us. It's

412
00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:14.448
setting things up. There's

413
00:09:14.448 --> 00:09:15.428
that database set up.

414
00:09:15.428 --> 00:09:16.589
The backup got copied

415
00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.807
to the database and

416
00:09:18.807 --> 00:09:19.048
there we go. it's

417
00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.907
starting the server for

418
00:09:20.907 --> 00:09:21.905
us. So you know,

419
00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:22.845
you can just keep

420
00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:24.024
piling on these powerful,

421
00:09:24.024 --> 00:09:25.842
reasonable prompts for yourself

422
00:09:25.842 --> 00:09:26.403
and for your team.

423
00:09:26.403 --> 00:09:27.282
And so there we

424
00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.520
go. It's now validating

425
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.759
that that work was

426
00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.000
done. Looks great. And
