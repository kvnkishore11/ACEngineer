2612
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:00.061
here. So we can

2613
00:52:00.061 --> 00:52:01.280
come in here, refresh,

2614
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.778
and that table is

2615
00:52:02.778 --> 00:52:04.478
no longer showing up.

2616
00:52:04.577 --> 00:52:05.516
Everything's looking great here.

2617
00:52:05.516 --> 00:52:06.717
That was resolved. Our

2618
00:52:06.717 --> 00:52:08.076
agents are doing more

2619
00:52:08.076 --> 00:52:08.815
and more for us.

2620
00:52:08.835 --> 00:52:10.295
So successful products grow,

2621
00:52:10.295 --> 00:52:11.474
they become complex. We

2622
00:52:11.474 --> 00:52:13.014
need agents to keep

2623
00:52:13.014 --> 00:52:14.713
track of everything as

2624
00:52:14.713 --> 00:52:16.012
they begin to operate

2625
00:52:16.012 --> 00:52:17.271
our codebase. In

2626
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:18.751
lesson six, we conclude

2627
00:52:18.811 --> 00:52:20.650
our epic journey along

2628
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.369
the software developer lifecycle

2629
00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:23.628
where our agents will

2630
00:52:23.628 --> 00:52:24.809
nearly be operating our

2631
00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:26.827
entire codebase themselves.

2632
00:52:26.847 --> 00:52:27.567
And so I know

2633
00:52:27.586 --> 00:52:28.347
this is a lot.

2634
00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:29.965
We're moving quickly along

2635
00:52:29.965 --> 00:52:31.505
this software developer lifecycle.
