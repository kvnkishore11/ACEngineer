2343
00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:31.371
really meta now. Ultimately,

2344
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:32.291
it all builds up

2345
00:46:32.291 --> 00:46:33.530
to this, right? ADW

2346
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.509
plan build test. And

2347
00:46:35.509 --> 00:46:36.728
this is what ran

2348
00:46:36.849 --> 00:46:37.588
in the beginning. Let's

2349
00:46:37.588 --> 00:46:38.307
go ahead. You can

2350
00:46:38.307 --> 00:46:38.867
see we have, you

2351
00:46:38.867 --> 00:46:40.286
know, the exact steps

2352
00:46:40.367 --> 00:46:41.385
built up there. We

2353
00:46:41.385 --> 00:46:42.264
are working our way

2354
00:46:42.385 --> 00:46:43.304
through the software development

2355
00:46:43.304 --> 00:46:44.563
lifecycle with our agents.

2356
00:46:44.563 --> 00:46:45.384
And if we open

2357
00:46:45.384 --> 00:46:46.222
up the browser here,

2358
00:46:46.742 --> 00:46:47.561
we can check on

2359
00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:48.932
that feature. So inside

2360
00:46:48.932 --> 00:46:49.891
this issue, you can

2361
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:50.489
see we have a

2362
00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:52.068
PR attached and we

2363
00:46:52.068 --> 00:46:52.746
have a bunch of

2364
00:46:52.746 --> 00:46:55.121
work recorded. And you

2365
00:46:55.121 --> 00:46:55.760
can see this workflow

2366
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.878
took some time and

2367
00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:58.056
it ended up with

2368
00:46:58.056 --> 00:47:00.282
one test failure. And
