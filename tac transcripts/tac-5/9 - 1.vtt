186
00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:30.120
teaching your agents to

187
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.240
test, you continue to

188
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.600
dial up the autonomy

189
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.158
level of your agents

190
00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:35.197
in your codebase.

191
00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:36.317
We continue the trend

192
00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:37.257
of building out the

193
00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.415
net new Agentic layer

194
00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:41.175
around your codebase.

195
00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:42.473
This is us building

196
00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:44.012
the system that builds

197
00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:45.112
the system. Keep this

198
00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:46.512
idea in mind because

199
00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:48.391
this is the differentiating

200
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:50.730
factor between Agentic Engineers

201
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.690
and engineers of the

202
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.889
past. Let's be clear

203
00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:53.930
in our terminology here.

204
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.850
When I refer to

205
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.509
in-loop Agentic coding, I

206
00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.649
mean you sitting right

207
00:04:57.668 --> 00:04:59.067
here, prompting with your

208
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:00.208
agent back and forth.
