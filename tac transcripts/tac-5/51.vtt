1255
00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:30.250
crap ton more than,

1256
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.869
you know, just one,

1257
00:25:30.869 --> 00:25:31.469
but we can put

1258
00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:32.189
it under one bucket,

1259
00:25:32.209 --> 00:25:33.067
right? You know, with

1260
00:25:33.127 --> 00:25:34.866
this, we're adding tons

1261
00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:36.325
of confidence to our

1262
00:25:36.325 --> 00:25:37.345
agents. Now, let's move

1263
00:25:37.345 --> 00:25:38.324
forward from this, right?

1264
00:25:38.324 --> 00:25:38.903
We now know that

1265
00:25:38.903 --> 00:25:39.682
we can add these

1266
00:25:39.722 --> 00:25:41.281
powerful closed loop prompts

1267
00:25:41.281 --> 00:25:42.161
where our agents can

1268
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:43.559
validate their own work.

1269
00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:44.858
They can know that

1270
00:25:44.858 --> 00:25:45.718
what they've done is

1271
00:25:45.718 --> 00:25:46.876
correct, just like you

1272
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:48.096
or I can by

1273
00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:49.855
running tests, by building,

1274
00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:51.473
by compiling, by looking

1275
00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:52.393
at the browser, right?

1276
00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:53.452
We're handing this off

1277
00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:54.232
to our agent. So

1278
00:25:54.232 --> 00:25:54.652
how do we take

1279
00:25:54.652 --> 00:25:55.271
this a step further?

1280
00:25:55.271 --> 00:25:56.551
How do we embed

1281
00:25:56.571 --> 00:25:58.691
this into the Agentic

1282
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.849
layer, right? The new

1283
00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:01.329
Agentic layer that we're
