426
00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.000
done. Looks great. And

427
00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:31.979
then it's going to

428
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:32.697
report a bunch of

429
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.977
stuff to us here.

430
00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:35.017
While this is running,

431
00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:35.895
let's discuss a couple

432
00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:36.755
things. So there are

433
00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:37.815
many ways to test.

434
00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:38.594
In this lesson, we're

435
00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:39.977
going to cover common

436
00:09:39.977 --> 00:09:41.138
feedback loops you can

437
00:09:41.138 --> 00:09:42.398
give your agents use

438
00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:43.537
these as guides to

439
00:09:43.537 --> 00:09:44.756
understand what you can

440
00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:45.636
do but while you're

441
00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:46.437
looking at this while

442
00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:47.417
we're working through this

443
00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:49.255
don't limit yourself remember

444
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.495
everything is one tool

445
00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:51.836
call away tools are

446
00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:53.196
just functions and functions

447
00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:54.336
can do anything we'll

448
00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:55.634
work through these capabilities

449
00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:57.534
using in-loop Agentic coding

450
00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:58.475
like we are here

451
00:09:58.495 --> 00:09:59.815
right we are actively

452
00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:00.674
prompting back and forth
