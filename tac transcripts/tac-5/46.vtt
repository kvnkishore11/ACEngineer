1138
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.070
I just wanna focus

1139
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.871
in here on what

1140
00:23:00.871 --> 00:23:02.910
an isolated agent that's

1141
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.509
just testing will look

1142
00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:05.729
like. And so check

1143
00:23:05.729 --> 00:23:06.308
this out, right? We

1144
00:23:06.308 --> 00:23:07.808
have two screenshots saved.

1145
00:23:07.828 --> 00:23:08.348
We go to refresh

1146
00:23:08.348 --> 00:23:09.708
terminal here, type GS

1147
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:10.827
for Git status. You

1148
00:23:10.827 --> 00:23:11.387
can see we have

1149
00:23:11.387 --> 00:23:13.067
those modified files from

1150
00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:14.626
our linting executions and

1151
00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:16.186
we have our before

1152
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:17.246
and end files. So

1153
00:23:17.246 --> 00:23:17.665
if we look at

1154
00:23:17.665 --> 00:23:19.561
before, you can see

1155
00:23:19.602 --> 00:23:20.721
a real snapshot of

1156
00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:21.680
our codebase. And

1157
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.279
you'll notice, you know,

1158
00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:22.819
we have a couple

1159
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:23.898
of modifications here from

1160
00:23:23.898 --> 00:23:24.898
the original state. It

1161
00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:25.998
looks like our tests

1162
00:23:25.998 --> 00:23:27.037
are modifying our code

1163
00:23:27.037 --> 00:23:27.696
base here, which is

1164
00:23:27.696 --> 00:23:29.036
an issue. Bookmark that.

1165
00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:29.715
We're gonna fix that

1166
00:23:29.715 --> 00:23:30.316
in a second. But
