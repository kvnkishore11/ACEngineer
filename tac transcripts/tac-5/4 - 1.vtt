75
00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.334
and production system, it's

76
00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:02.852
that complex. This is

77
00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.292
where code-based architecture comes

78
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.290
into play as a

79
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.209
massive critical leverage point.

80
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.408
Net new codebases

81
00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:09.548
have a massive advantage

82
00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.407
here. So let's go

83
00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:10.927
ahead and answer the

84
00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:12.146
question. When we ship

85
00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.657
code to production, how

86
00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:14.657
do we validate that

87
00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:15.836
our work has shipped

88
00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.193
successfully? If you think

89
00:02:17.193 --> 00:02:18.492
through this, you'll find

90
00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:19.711
a concrete flow of

91
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.230
steps and tools that

92
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.449
you go through to

93
00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:23.728
know that your code

94
00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:25.467
base has shipped successfully

95
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.963
in production without errors.

96
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:29.122
For example, you might

97
00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.401
run your linter, you
