1877
00:37:29.996 --> 00:37:30.815
going to run to

1878
00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.135
completion here. Let's go

1879
00:37:32.135 --> 00:37:32.753
ahead and move on

1880
00:37:32.753 --> 00:37:34.391
to the next abstraction

1881
00:37:34.391 --> 00:37:35.630
level. We've You know,

1882
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.449
started with our simple

1883
00:37:37.449 --> 00:37:38.489
closed loop prompt. We're

1884
00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.487
just running a linter.

1885
00:37:39.487 --> 00:37:40.867
We then added entire

1886
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.606
backend tests with PyTests

1887
00:37:42.646 --> 00:37:43.967
and we're compiling the

1888
00:37:43.967 --> 00:37:45.246
backend now. We're letting

1889
00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:45.885
our agent know that

1890
00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:46.945
it's done the job

1891
00:37:46.945 --> 00:37:47.744
to completion. And then

1892
00:37:47.744 --> 00:37:49.423
we added full on

1893
00:37:49.463 --> 00:37:50.744
backend, frontend, end to

1894
00:37:50.744 --> 00:37:52.083
end tests. Again, we're

1895
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.342
just stacking up. We're

1896
00:37:53.342 --> 00:37:54.722
increasing the confidence that

1897
00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:56.101
our agent has done

1898
00:37:56.222 --> 00:37:57.601
everything to completion without

1899
00:37:57.601 --> 00:37:59.500
regression. We've then templated

1900
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.460
our engineering. And so
