799
00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:30.010
move this. It's gonna

800
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.110
resolve the issue. There

801
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.890
it is. Our agent

802
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.250
added some duplicate imports.

803
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.989
This happens. Okay. Now

804
00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:35.948
it's gonna run Ruff

805
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:37.187
again. So check this

806
00:16:37.187 --> 00:16:37.888
out. It ran it

807
00:16:37.888 --> 00:16:39.347
again, right? It's validating

808
00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:40.547
its test again. And

809
00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:41.767
now it's continuing to

810
00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.806
the next step. Now

811
00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:44.066
it's closing the next

812
00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:45.164
loop. Okay. So now

813
00:16:45.164 --> 00:16:46.024
we know that our

814
00:16:46.024 --> 00:16:47.203
code is formatted. Here

815
00:16:47.203 --> 00:16:48.224
we go, PyTest. And

816
00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:49.104
so PyTest is running.

817
00:16:49.104 --> 00:16:49.682
Looks like there is

818
00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:50.523
an error here. Let's

819
00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:51.182
see what the error

820
00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:51.922
was and what our

821
00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:53.234
agent does. Okay, so

822
00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:53.893
it sees that that

823
00:16:53.893 --> 00:16:55.212
line is commented out

824
00:16:55.373 --> 00:16:56.052
and it picked up

825
00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:56.731
on the bug that

826
00:16:56.731 --> 00:16:57.571
we created in our

827
00:16:57.571 --> 00:16:59.309
last prompt, right? So

828
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.850
it sees that the

829
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.149
validate SQL query has
