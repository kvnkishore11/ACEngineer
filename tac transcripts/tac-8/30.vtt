642
00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:01.123
code, we are slowly

643
00:15:01.123 --> 00:15:02.162
moving out the loop.

644
00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:03.732
right? I'm not responding

645
00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:04.293
here. I'm not having

646
00:15:04.293 --> 00:15:05.312
a conversation with the

647
00:15:05.312 --> 00:15:06.812
agent. I'm firing it

648
00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:08.191
off, having it operate,

649
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:09.331
right? It's firing this

650
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.129
slash start prompt, which

651
00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:12.668
literally could be anything.

652
00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.009
At first, you're fully

653
00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:14.788
in the loop, right?

654
00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:15.768
Operating inside of a

655
00:15:15.768 --> 00:15:17.486
Claude Code instance, right?

656
00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:18.326
Typing back and forth

657
00:15:18.326 --> 00:15:19.046
and back and forth.

658
00:15:19.225 --> 00:15:19.846
This is a great

659
00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:20.664
place to start. It's

660
00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:21.225
a great place to

661
00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:22.125
do deep work. It's

662
00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:22.803
a great place to

663
00:15:22.803 --> 00:15:23.964
update and work on

664
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:24.923
your agent to glare.

665
00:15:24.962 --> 00:15:26.342
It's a terrible place

666
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.022
to stay, okay? So

667
00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.441
many engineers are going

668
00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:30.740
to miss this mark.
