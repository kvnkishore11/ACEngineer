739
00:16:59.312 --> 00:17:00.610
agentic prompts, so they're

740
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.431
doing a lot more

741
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:02.471
work than normal. We

742
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:03.490
happen to be running

743
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.150
a template meta prompt,

744
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.789
right? This is the

745
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:07.169
chore file. And then

746
00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:08.249
once that gets built,

747
00:17:08.249 --> 00:17:09.989
the chore response has

748
00:17:09.989 --> 00:17:11.108
this output. It outputs

749
00:17:11.108 --> 00:17:11.988
a plan path, and

750
00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:12.708
then we take that,

751
00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:13.548
and guess what we

752
00:17:13.548 --> 00:17:14.087
do with it? We

753
00:17:14.087 --> 00:17:15.067
pass it right into

754
00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:15.926
implement. If you look

755
00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:17.086
at implement, you can

756
00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:17.606
see that we have

757
00:17:17.606 --> 00:17:18.826
one argument, which is

758
00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:20.185
the plan. And this

759
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:23.204
begins infinite combinations and

760
00:17:23.204 --> 00:17:24.565
composables that you can

761
00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:25.924
put together to solve

762
00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:27.644
real engineering problems. There

763
00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:28.284
are many, many ways

764
00:17:28.284 --> 00:17:29.203
to slice this, right?

765
00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:30.003
You can make a
