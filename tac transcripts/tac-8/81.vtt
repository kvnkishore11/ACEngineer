1880
00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:30.530
we have an agent

1881
00:40:30.769 --> 00:40:32.289
inside of our app.

1882
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:34.146
We're talking with Nexus,

1883
00:40:34.246 --> 00:40:35.885
hello. And of course

1884
00:40:35.885 --> 00:40:37.264
we can do something

1885
00:40:37.264 --> 00:40:38.664
really powerful. The power

1886
00:40:38.664 --> 00:40:40.003
of agents isn't in

1887
00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:41.802
one, it's in many,

1888
00:40:41.842 --> 00:40:43.300
slash AEA, spin up

1889
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.260
another one, get some

1890
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.000
more work done. We're

1891
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.898
now talking to Roon

1892
00:40:45.898 --> 00:40:47.297
as well. What is

1893
00:40:47.297 --> 00:40:48.717
this codebase about?

1894
00:40:48.717 --> 00:40:49.815
Okay, and then over

1895
00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:51.315
here we'll say update

1896
00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:54.125
the generate random query

1897
00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:56.722
button in the what

1898
00:40:56.722 --> 00:40:57.402
app is this app

1899
00:40:57.402 --> 00:40:58.400
five, let's call it

1900
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.679
interface to be generate.
