2192
00:47:28.744 --> 00:47:30.563
against some validation function.

2193
00:47:30.724 --> 00:47:31.224
If they can do

2194
00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:33.202
this at scale for

2195
00:47:33.202 --> 00:47:35.760
serious, life-changing, world-changing problems,

2196
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.360
you can do this

2197
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.000
on your codebase.

2198
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.018
I can guarantee you

2199
00:47:38.159 --> 00:47:39.579
there is a validation,

2200
00:47:39.797 --> 00:47:40.938
a set of validations

2201
00:47:40.938 --> 00:47:41.617
in your codebase

2202
00:47:41.617 --> 00:47:44.076
that once run ensures

2203
00:47:44.076 --> 00:47:46.434
everything works perfectly, okay?

2204
00:47:46.554 --> 00:47:47.574
The only question is,

2205
00:47:47.753 --> 00:47:48.313
do you know what

2206
00:47:48.313 --> 00:47:49.012
it is, right? Do

2207
00:47:49.012 --> 00:47:49.413
you know what those

2208
00:47:49.413 --> 00:47:50.831
commands are? Always add

2209
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:52.530
feedback loops. Now, controversial

2210
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:53.590
one, but it's important.

2211
00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:55.230
One agent, one prompt,

2212
00:47:55.393 --> 00:47:56.773
One purpose. There are

2213
00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.012
limits to what we

2214
00:47:58.012 --> 00:47:59.012
can do with agentic

2215
00:47:59.032 --> 00:48:00.851
technology, okay? Especially if
