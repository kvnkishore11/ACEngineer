1673
00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:00.878
do, right? Yet another

1674
00:36:00.878 --> 00:36:02.117
example of work that

1675
00:36:02.117 --> 00:36:03.036
you don't need to

1676
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.277
be doing if you

1677
00:36:04.277 --> 00:36:05.735
invest into the agentic

1678
00:36:05.735 --> 00:36:06.556
layer of your code

1679
00:36:06.556 --> 00:36:07.295
base. All right, so

1680
00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:07.695
you can see here

1681
00:36:07.695 --> 00:36:08.755
we're on the implementation

1682
00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:10.074
step. You slowly want

1683
00:36:10.094 --> 00:36:10.954
to progress from in

1684
00:36:10.954 --> 00:36:11.753
loop to out loop

1685
00:36:11.913 --> 00:36:13.293
and the north star

1686
00:36:13.331 --> 00:36:14.211
from lesson seven, you

1687
00:36:14.211 --> 00:36:15.690
want to target zero

1688
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.030
touch engineering. This is

1689
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.929
what's going to happen

1690
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.730
naturally as you continue

1691
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.489
to improve your agentic

1692
00:36:21.489 --> 00:36:23.088
layer. Soon you won't

1693
00:36:23.168 --> 00:36:24.487
need to review. I

1694
00:36:24.487 --> 00:36:25.806
know that sounds crazy,

1695
00:36:25.806 --> 00:36:27.385
especially if you're finishing

1696
00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.083
this course earlier on

1697
00:36:29.244 --> 00:36:30.722
in the timeline of
