00:54:29.485 --> 00:54:30.425

realize that there's nothing

2508
00:54:36.101 --> 00:54:37.001
more important to be

2509
00:54:37.001 --> 00:54:38.701
investing in. You'll fully

2510
00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:41.059
understand tactic eight, prioritize

2511
00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:43.099
agentics, prioritize your agentic

2512
00:54:43.099 --> 00:54:44.617
layer. Of course, by

2513
00:54:44.617 --> 00:54:45.956
investing in your agentic

2514
00:54:45.956 --> 00:54:47.476
layer, you're actually investing

2515
00:54:47.476 --> 00:54:48.815
in your application layer,

2516
00:54:48.896 --> 00:54:50.255
right? It's all about

2517
00:54:50.255 --> 00:54:51.293
your users, your product,

2518
00:54:51.293 --> 00:54:52.193
and your company. This

2519
00:54:52.193 --> 00:54:53.393
is a constant in

2520
00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:54.353
the sea of change.

2521
00:54:54.353 --> 00:54:56.192
This never changes, right?

2522
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:57.150
Never forget who this

2523
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.351
is all for. Customers,

2524
00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:00.530
users, team, company, you.
