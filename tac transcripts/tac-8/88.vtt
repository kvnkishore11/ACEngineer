their context model prompt

2039
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.949
and tools to get

2040
00:44:02.949 --> 00:44:04.050
the job done. You

2041
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:05.608
then layer on 12

2042
00:44:05.608 --> 00:44:07.568
leverage points of agentic

2043
00:44:07.568 --> 00:44:08.706
coding and you give

2044
00:44:08.706 --> 00:44:09.447
them to your agent

2045
00:44:09.487 --> 00:44:10.246
at the right time

2046
00:44:10.246 --> 00:44:11.286
in the right place.

2047
00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:12.045
Okay, we have in-agent

2048
00:44:12.045 --> 00:44:13.664
leverage points, the core

2049
00:44:13.664 --> 00:44:15.105
four context model prompt

2050
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.623
tools and through agent

2051
00:44:16.623 --> 00:44:18.583
leverage points, right? Standard

2052
00:44:18.583 --> 00:44:22.106
out types, documentation, tests,

2053
00:44:22.146 --> 00:44:25.003
code-based architecture, plans, templates,

2054
00:44:25.043 --> 00:44:27.362
and ADWs, the highest

2055
00:44:27.362 --> 00:44:29.179
level of composition ADWs,

2056
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.998
code plus agentics. When
