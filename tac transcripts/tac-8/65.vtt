1508
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:30.744
open this up, you

1509
00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:31.243
know, we can always

1510
00:32:31.243 --> 00:32:32.722
just monitor and write

1511
00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:34.961
whatever report status update

1512
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:36.280
messages we want to.

1513
00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:37.359
This is yet again,

1514
00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:39.518
another Outloop system. You

1515
00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:40.896
can wire up to

1516
00:32:41.096 --> 00:32:42.755
agentic code, right? To

1517
00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:45.034
build with agentics, to

1518
00:32:45.034 --> 00:32:46.393
have your agents operate

1519
00:32:46.393 --> 00:32:47.951
on your behalf, generating

1520
00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:49.130
a work tree name.

1521
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.041
Great. work tree created

1522
00:32:51.421 --> 00:32:53.221
and always, right, as

1523
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:53.980
always, you can open

1524
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.200
up dot Claude, right,

1525
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.499
go into commands and

1526
00:32:56.499 --> 00:32:57.798
just see all the

1527
00:32:57.798 --> 00:33:00.178
possible agentic capabilities, right?
