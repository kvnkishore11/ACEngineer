1057
00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:30.115
and as results come

1058
00:23:30.115 --> 00:23:30.914
in, I can just

1059
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.973
add and update tasks

1060
00:23:32.973 --> 00:23:34.529
as my agent completes

1061
00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:35.689
work, okay? So this

1062
00:23:35.689 --> 00:23:36.388
is a small tweak.

1063
00:23:36.388 --> 00:23:36.989
This is one or

1064
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:38.268
two files of our

1065
00:23:38.268 --> 00:23:39.646
agents. And all of

1066
00:23:39.646 --> 00:23:40.326
a sudden we're able

1067
00:23:40.326 --> 00:23:41.166
to do a lot

1068
00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:42.865
more with a multi-agent

1069
00:23:42.885 --> 00:23:45.184
dedicated workspace system. Let's

1070
00:23:45.184 --> 00:23:45.684
go ahead and take

1071
00:23:45.684 --> 00:23:46.284
a look at what

1072
00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:47.263
this looks like, right?

1073
00:23:47.263 --> 00:23:47.703
So you can see

1074
00:23:47.703 --> 00:23:49.423
very, very similar setup,

1075
00:23:49.423 --> 00:23:51.041
right? AI developer workflows.

1076
00:23:51.041 --> 00:23:52.021
And then underneath all

1077
00:23:52.021 --> 00:23:53.401
that is our prompts

1078
00:23:53.401 --> 00:23:54.940
that run. Same pattern.

1079
00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:55.619
You're gonna see this

1080
00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:56.299
over and over. These

1081
00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:57.318
are the atoms. You

1082
00:23:57.318 --> 00:23:57.939
can see we got

1083
00:23:57.939 --> 00:23:59.798
another commit message there

1084
00:23:59.857 --> 00:24:00.977
kicking off. We're adding
