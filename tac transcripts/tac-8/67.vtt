00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:30.872
Plans, prompts, templates, ADWs,

1551
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:31.711
okay? And then we

1552
00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:33.530
have auxiliary leverage points,

1553
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.970
of course, right? Types,

1554
00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:36.750
tests, code-based structure. You

1555
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.608
can see here, we're

1556
00:33:37.608 --> 00:33:38.128
just gonna start to

1557
00:33:38.128 --> 00:33:39.127
get to work. So

1558
00:33:39.228 --> 00:33:40.948
multiple agents, again, getting

1559
00:33:40.948 --> 00:33:43.566
their own separate isolated

1560
00:33:43.566 --> 00:33:45.561
environment to work on

1561
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.500
some arbitrary task. What's

1562
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.640
the value proposition here?

1563
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.980
This codebase in

1564
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.938
particular specializes in creating

1565
00:33:52.978 --> 00:33:54.337
prototypes. We have that

1566
00:33:54.337 --> 00:33:56.057
classic plan. So this

1567
00:33:56.057 --> 00:33:56.916
is not new, right?

1568
00:33:56.916 --> 00:33:57.556
This is just a

1569
00:33:57.556 --> 00:33:59.375
plan template meta prompt,

1570
00:33:59.395 --> 00:34:00.674
very powerful, very useful,
