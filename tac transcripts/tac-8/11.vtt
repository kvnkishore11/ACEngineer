212
00:05:29.168 --> 00:05:30.067
this is a course

213
00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:32.627
on Agentic Coding tactical

214
00:05:32.687 --> 00:05:34.666
Agentic Coding key ideas

215
00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:35.346
you can bring to

216
00:05:35.346 --> 00:05:37.266
the battleground of engineering

217
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:38.807
with agents every single

218
00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:40.105
day okay that's what

219
00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:40.966
this has all been

220
00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:41.886
about and in this

221
00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:43.326
lesson your final lesson

222
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.041
we close the loop

223
00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:46.541
on this course. Let's

224
00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:47.341
start by pushing you

225
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.360
toward the minimum viable

226
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.701
agentic layer. Let's work

227
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:51.781
our way through different

228
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.300
examples, different shapes of

229
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.720
what this agentic layer

230
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.639
can look like. You'll

231
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.240
see a lot of

232
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.379
similarities. I've repurposed a

233
00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.079
lot of the work
