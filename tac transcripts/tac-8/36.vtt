789
00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:01.346
plan and build. We

790
00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:02.067
don't need this much

791
00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:02.865
compute for a simple

792
00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:03.786
task like this, but

793
00:18:03.806 --> 00:18:04.625
I just wanna showcase

794
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.105
that you want complete

795
00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:08.003
control over your agentic

796
00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:08.943
workflow. The best way

797
00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:09.903
to do that is

798
00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:10.742
you don't wanna keep

799
00:18:10.742 --> 00:18:12.103
them in prompt form.

800
00:18:12.103 --> 00:18:13.021
You wanna scale them

801
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.342
up and fuse them

802
00:18:14.342 --> 00:18:16.320
with the non-deterministic world

803
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.259
of raw code. The

804
00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:19.579
whole point here is

805
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:20.759
that you can use

806
00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:22.219
your prompts inside of

807
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:23.837
this new agentic layer

808
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:25.713
and scale up and

809
00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:27.113
build out unique developer

810
00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.632
workflows that solve sets

811
00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:30.112
of problems. Right here,
