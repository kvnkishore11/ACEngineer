2727
00:59:27.853 --> 00:59:30.172
prioritizable. So depending on

2728
00:59:30.172 --> 00:59:31.371
demand, depending on what

2729
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:32.570
you choose there, I'll

2730
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:33.809
steer in the direction

2731
00:59:33.809 --> 00:59:35.230
that accelerates the growth

2732
00:59:35.369 --> 00:59:36.548
of as many cracked

2733
00:59:36.548 --> 00:59:37.409
engineers like you as

2734
00:59:37.409 --> 00:59:38.768
possible. So thank you

2735
00:59:38.768 --> 00:59:39.507
that and that'll be

2736
00:59:39.507 --> 00:59:40.686
available to you as

2737
00:59:40.686 --> 00:59:41.806
you finish this lesson.

2738
00:59:41.885 --> 00:59:42.704
It doesn't matter if

2739
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:43.744
you know that the

2740
00:59:43.744 --> 00:59:44.884
future is already here.

2741
00:59:44.884 --> 00:59:46.163
What matters is that

2742
00:59:46.163 --> 00:59:47.161
you do something about

2743
00:59:47.161 --> 00:59:47.762
it. You have to

2744
00:59:47.762 --> 00:59:48.460
be the one that

2745
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.059
runs toward the future

2746
00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.639
while others walk away,

2747
00:59:51.739 --> 00:59:53.318
run away, stand still,

2748
00:59:53.338 --> 00:59:54.617
or walk forward. You

2749
00:59:54.617 --> 00:59:55.715
now have everything you

2750
00:59:55.715 --> 00:59:57.135
need to win big

2751
00:59:57.275 --> 00:59:58.393
in phase two of

2752
00:59:58.393 --> 00:59:59.853
the generative AI age,

2753
00:59:59.853 --> 01:00:01.532
the age of agents.
