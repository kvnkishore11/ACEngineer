146
00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:00.048
good starting point, I

147
00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:01.567
recommend half of your

148
00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:03.145
engineering time, at least

149
00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.590
half, should be spent

150
00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:05.883
on the new agentic

151
00:04:05.883 --> 00:04:06.978
layer. And of course,

152
00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:07.849
when you're starting out,

153
00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:08.649
when you're building it

154
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.888
initially, you're gonna wanna

155
00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:10.847
put in a lot

156
00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:12.146
of upfront effort. So

157
00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:12.985
let's make this absolutely

158
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:14.264
clear. There's the agentic

159
00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:15.164
layer, and then there's

160
00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:16.884
the application layer. And

161
00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:18.202
inside application layer, I'm

162
00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:19.422
being very vague. We're

163
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.500
talking DevOps layer, infrastructure

164
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.079
layer, database layer, and

165
00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.697
the actual raw application

166
00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:25.637
layer, okay? It all

167
00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.076
goes under there. There's

168
00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:28.516
the application layer, and

169
00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:29.975
there's your agentic layer.
