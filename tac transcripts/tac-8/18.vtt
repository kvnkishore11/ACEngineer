371
00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:01.076
directory and a log

372
00:09:01.076 --> 00:09:02.534
directory. This lets us

373
00:09:02.534 --> 00:09:04.254
tap into exactly the

374
00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:05.073
work that our agents

375
00:09:05.073 --> 00:09:06.013
have done. So here's

376
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:06.952
a V1 setup that

377
00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:07.773
you can use, right?

378
00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:09.111
You have prime, we

379
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:10.211
have start, right? So

380
00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:11.091
you're gonna wanna start

381
00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:12.210
up your application. We

382
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.330
can boot up in

383
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.948
the loop, type slash

384
00:09:14.948 --> 00:09:16.129
start, get our agent

385
00:09:16.129 --> 00:09:17.048
up and running, right?

386
00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:18.307
Fire off the code.

387
00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.606
You can see here,

388
00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:19.966
we just have a

389
00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:21.245
simple UV run and

390
00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:22.365
a bond run, but

391
00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:23.125
this can be as

392
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:23.924
complex as you need

393
00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:24.424
it to be to

394
00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:26.203
start your application. Your

395
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:28.102
agents are handling, managing

396
00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:28.961
your codebase, running

397
00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:30.201
your codebase, restarting
