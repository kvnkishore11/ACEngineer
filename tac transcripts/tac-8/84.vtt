1946
00:41:59.778 --> 00:42:00.677
can play with this.

1947
00:42:00.737 --> 00:42:01.217
This is a very

1948
00:42:01.217 --> 00:42:02.456
powerful idea. You can

1949
00:42:02.456 --> 00:42:03.755
see here our agents

1950
00:42:03.856 --> 00:42:04.655
are doing work. They're

1951
00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:05.994
responding to us. It

1952
00:42:06.074 --> 00:42:07.293
updated this button for

1953
00:42:07.293 --> 00:42:08.293
us. And this just

1954
00:42:08.293 --> 00:42:09.552
goes on and on

1955
00:42:09.552 --> 00:42:10.530
and on. I'm gonna

1956
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.391
stop here. There's a

1957
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:12.329
lot of value in

1958
00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:12.929
this. This is a

1959
00:42:12.929 --> 00:42:14.527
great place to branch

1960
00:42:14.527 --> 00:42:15.748
away from the code

1961
00:42:15.748 --> 00:42:17.706
itself, okay? The keys

1962
00:42:17.865 --> 00:42:18.646
of the future of

1963
00:42:18.646 --> 00:42:20.983
engineering are conceptual. It's

1964
00:42:20.983 --> 00:42:22.083
all about the information

1965
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:23.141
you have, the details

1966
00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:24.146
of the code, They

1967
00:42:24.146 --> 00:42:25.184
matter, the details of

1968
00:42:25.184 --> 00:42:26.204
the prompts, they do

1969
00:42:26.204 --> 00:42:27.164
matter, which is why

1970
00:42:27.164 --> 00:42:28.003
we've broken them down

1971
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.702
to individual tactics. But

1972
00:42:29.722 --> 00:42:30.583
a lot of what
