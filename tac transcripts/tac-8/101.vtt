2329
00:50:29.922 --> 00:50:31.782
be super clear. What

2330
00:50:31.782 --> 00:50:32.880
is the agentic layer?

2331
00:50:33.181 --> 00:50:34.320
It is the combination

2332
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.778
of traditional deterministic code

2333
00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:38.038
that is stored in

2334
00:50:38.038 --> 00:50:40.275
your ADW's directory as

2335
00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:42.155
a scriptable layer that

2336
00:50:42.155 --> 00:50:44.992
combines deterministic code with

2337
00:50:44.992 --> 00:50:47.471
the new non-deterministic agentic

2338
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.630
technology, the language model,

2339
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.528
the agent, Claude Code,

2340
00:50:51.528 --> 00:50:53.268
and whatever variants are

2341
00:50:53.268 --> 00:50:54.387
gonna come next, right?

2342
00:50:54.608 --> 00:50:55.746
You combine these two

2343
00:50:55.746 --> 00:50:57.726
things. This makes up

2344
00:50:57.826 --> 00:50:59.405
your agentic layer, the

2345
00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:01.144
old world of deterministic
