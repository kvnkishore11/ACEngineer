00:19:58.182 --> 00:20:00.421
data science, classical Jupiter

887
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:01.641
notebook scenario. So we

888
00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:02.539
can execute this top

889
00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:03.180
to bottom and we

890
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.778
can just see that

891
00:20:03.778 --> 00:20:04.578
we're operating on a

892
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.938
simple tweets CSV file

893
00:20:06.978 --> 00:20:08.317
and just looking through

894
00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:09.435
a bunch of tweets

895
00:20:09.435 --> 00:20:10.994
and running some arbitrary

896
00:20:10.994 --> 00:20:14.193
analysis and classification on

897
00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:16.073
some tweets sentiment distribution

898
00:20:16.073 --> 00:20:17.951
5050. That's definitely not

899
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.230
the true distribution. But

900
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.570
you know, you can

901
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.090
see here, we just

902
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.950
have a simple Jupyter

903
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.009
notebook where we're doing

904
00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:24.709
some data exploration. Now,

905
00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:26.188
all of the application

906
00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:27.188
level work that we've

907
00:20:27.188 --> 00:20:28.346
done here, it's all

908
00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:29.366
example codebased work

909
00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:30.326
here. So this isn't
