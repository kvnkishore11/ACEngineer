WEBVTT

962
00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:30.528
to out loop and

963
00:21:30.528 --> 00:21:32.528
eventually to ZTE. All

964
00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:33.288
we're gonna do here

965
00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:34.567
is kick off our

966
00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:35.647
ADW. So I'm just

967
00:21:35.647 --> 00:21:36.807
gonna open this, copy

968
00:21:36.807 --> 00:21:37.928
the relative file path,

969
00:21:38.127 --> 00:21:39.448
UV run, and we're

970
00:21:39.448 --> 00:21:40.208
gonna kick this off.

971
00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:41.567
And this is gonna

972
00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.626
be really interesting, okay?

973
00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:43.507
So we have a

974
00:21:43.507 --> 00:21:44.567
gray area in loop,

975
00:21:44.606 --> 00:21:45.567
out loop system here.

976
00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:46.826
We're operating on this

977
00:21:46.826 --> 00:21:48.307
kind of shared task

978
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.286
file. Every five seconds,

979
00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:51.705
our trigger is going

980
00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:52.938
to pick up on

981
00:21:52.938 --> 00:21:53.936
tasks that need to

982
00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.037
be operated. And so

983
00:21:55.037 --> 00:21:55.875
you can see here,

984
00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:57.275
it found seven tasks

985
00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.653
to kick off and

986
00:21:58.834 --> 00:21:59.294
we're now going to

987
00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:00.073
start creating these work
