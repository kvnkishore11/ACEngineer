1133
00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:00.509
for build, update task,

1134
00:25:00.509 --> 00:25:01.929
you can see that's

1135
00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:02.788
that workflow script that's

1136
00:25:02.788 --> 00:25:03.727
getting kicked off there

1137
00:25:03.727 --> 00:25:05.046
by default. But if

1138
00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:06.684
we pass in our

1139
00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:08.584
upgraded ADW ID, it

1140
00:25:08.584 --> 00:25:10.823
will also perform a

1141
00:25:10.823 --> 00:25:12.442
plan implement, right? So

1142
00:25:12.442 --> 00:25:13.800
it'll run this other

1143
00:25:13.861 --> 00:25:15.420
AI developer workflow. Okay,

1144
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.578
so our trigger helps

1145
00:25:16.578 --> 00:25:17.798
us stay further out

1146
00:25:17.798 --> 00:25:18.616
the loop so that

1147
00:25:18.616 --> 00:25:19.757
we can operate more

1148
00:25:19.757 --> 00:25:21.016
quickly, right? We're not

1149
00:25:21.036 --> 00:25:22.035
prompting back and forth

1150
00:25:22.035 --> 00:25:22.795
and back and forth.

1151
00:25:22.934 --> 00:25:23.773
We're scaling up the

1152
00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.394
number of agents we're

1153
00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:26.132
running with this task-based

1154
00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:27.631
system. Prong trigger helps

1155
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.411
us do that. And

1156
00:25:28.411 --> 00:25:28.891
you can see here

1157
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:30.313
agents are just rolling
