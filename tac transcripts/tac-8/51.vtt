1157
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:30.313
agents are just rolling

1158
00:25:30.353 --> 00:25:32.109
in work, right? They're

1159
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.127
rolling in work. And

1160
00:25:33.127 --> 00:25:33.727
so you can imagine

1161
00:25:33.727 --> 00:25:34.704
what these emojis are,

1162
00:25:34.724 --> 00:25:35.583
right? Check means done.

1163
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:36.520
And we have this

1164
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.097
timer. This means blocker.

1165
00:25:38.198 --> 00:25:39.296
So you'll notice, you

1166
00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:40.413
know, this timer here,

1167
00:25:40.546 --> 00:25:41.586
didn't start until the

1168
00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:43.046
two above were checked

1169
00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:44.424
off. Okay. So this

1170
00:25:44.424 --> 00:25:46.424
is just an arbitrary

1171
00:25:46.424 --> 00:25:47.565
agentic layer. I just

1172
00:25:47.565 --> 00:25:48.444
built this out this

1173
00:25:48.444 --> 00:25:49.105
way. Okay. You can

1174
00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:50.003
build it any way

1175
00:25:50.003 --> 00:25:51.223
you want. That's great.

1176
00:25:51.223 --> 00:25:51.963
And so, you know,

1177
00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:53.064
same deal here, right?

1178
00:25:53.064 --> 00:25:53.683
If we jump into

1179
00:25:53.683 --> 00:25:55.144
build update task, we

1180
00:25:55.144 --> 00:25:57.002
can just slash search,

1181
00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.182
always just slash search

1182
00:25:58.182 --> 00:25:59.222
your prompts. You can

1183
00:25:59.222 --> 00:26:00.363
see there, we initialize
