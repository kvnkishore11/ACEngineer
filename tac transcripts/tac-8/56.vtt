1286
00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:00.897
a look at what's

1287
00:28:00.897 --> 00:28:01.856
been done, right? If

1288
00:28:01.856 --> 00:28:02.777
we look at our

1289
00:28:02.777 --> 00:28:03.776
work, our agents are

1290
00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:04.875
just cooking, right? They're

1291
00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:05.994
getting work done for

1292
00:28:05.994 --> 00:28:07.394
us. I throw in,

1293
00:28:07.473 --> 00:28:09.252
what did I throw

1294
00:28:09.252 --> 00:28:10.592
in here? Seven, eight,

1295
00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:11.631
nine, something like 10

1296
00:28:11.631 --> 00:28:12.970
tasks and it all

1297
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.528
started in parallel on

1298
00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:15.469
these separate work trees.

1299
00:28:15.469 --> 00:28:16.748
Okay, so let's just

1300
00:28:16.748 --> 00:28:17.446
go ahead and validate

1301
00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:18.467
some work. Okay, so

1302
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:20.698
enhanced, data training. So

1303
00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:21.258
what we can do

1304
00:28:21.258 --> 00:28:21.978
here is open up

1305
00:28:21.978 --> 00:28:23.417
trees and you can

1306
00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:23.916
see we have the

1307
00:28:23.916 --> 00:28:27.757
enhanced training data directory

1308
00:28:27.757 --> 00:28:28.616
and I can just

1309
00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:30.476
CD trees or actually
