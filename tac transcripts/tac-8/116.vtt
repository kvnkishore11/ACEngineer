00:57:58.577 --> 00:58:01.760
Agentic Engineers, Agentic Engineering.

2657
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:02.599
You want to be

2658
00:58:02.639 --> 00:58:03.739
one of the engineers

2659
00:58:03.759 --> 00:58:05.358
that internalizes this and

2660
00:58:05.358 --> 00:58:06.755
bets on this reality

2661
00:58:06.755 --> 00:58:07.596
now. You don't want

2662
00:58:07.615 --> 00:58:08.554
to fall behind. The

2663
00:58:08.574 --> 00:58:10.233
Agentic Engineer builds the

2664
00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:11.931
system that builds the

2665
00:58:11.931 --> 00:58:14.670
system. Prioritize agentics. Thank

2666
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.510
you so much for

2667
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:16.568
trusting me. I have

2668
00:58:16.568 --> 00:58:17.327
something to ask of

2669
00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.288
you. I am just

2670
00:58:18.288 --> 00:58:19.826
one man, one guy

2671
00:58:19.826 --> 00:58:21.322
that tries to push

2672
00:58:21.322 --> 00:58:22.360
what he knows to

2673
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.260
the edge over and

2674
00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:23.840
over and over as

2675
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:24.920
much as possible. But

2676
00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:25.820
no matter how much

2677
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.659
I push, no matter

2678
00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:28.099
how I optimize my

2679
00:58:28.099 --> 00:58:28.978
day, my time, my

2680
00:58:28.978 --> 00:58:30.039
schedule, my life, my
