00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.409
power of the agentic

1819
00:39:00.429 --> 00:39:01.188
layer. This is the

1820
00:39:01.188 --> 00:39:03.128
power of building great

1821
00:39:03.128 --> 00:39:05.766
prompts, investing in your

1822
00:39:05.847 --> 00:39:07.425
agentic layer, investing in

1823
00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:08.244
the prompts, investing in

1824
00:39:08.244 --> 00:39:09.744
the ADWs, understanding the

1825
00:39:09.744 --> 00:39:11.244
12 leverage points, right?

1826
00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:12.244
This is what it's

1827
00:39:12.244 --> 00:39:13.862
all about, okay? We're

1828
00:39:13.862 --> 00:39:16.061
solving multitudes of engineering

1829
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:17.300
problem here, right? We

1830
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.440
have this UV watch

1831
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.260
that was created. We

1832
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.358
have this BunScript watch

1833
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.059
application that was also

1834
00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.257
created for us. Look

1835
00:39:23.318 --> 00:39:24.737
at our velocity. Our

1836
00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:27.177
velocity is absolutely mind-blowing.

1837
00:39:27.556 --> 00:39:28.195
We have to move

1838
00:39:28.195 --> 00:39:29.115
on. here you know
