304
00:07:29.322 --> 00:07:30.961
be isolated from your

305
00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:33.262
application layer. Okay? This

306
00:07:33.262 --> 00:07:34.141
is a really important

307
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:35.940
distinction. Our application and

308
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.600
our agents, right? They're

309
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.339
distinctly different. Okay? Our

310
00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:40.740
apps is in a

311
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.459
completely separate directory that

312
00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:43.699
our agentic layer, our

313
00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.377
agentic ring can operate

314
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:46.398
around. And so of

315
00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.577
course, None of this

316
00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:48.358
works without the prompts,

317
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:48.757
so we need the

318
00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:50.237
prompts. And your AI

319
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:51.557
developer workflows allow you

320
00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:52.937
to combine the old

321
00:07:52.937 --> 00:07:55.875
world of deterministic guaranteed

322
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.435
code execution with the

323
00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.795
new world of agents.

324
00:07:58.795 --> 00:07:59.795
That's why we need
