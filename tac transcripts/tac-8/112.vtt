2568
00:55:58.871 --> 00:56:00.269
your agentic layer to

2569
00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:02.048
run and control your

2570
00:56:02.048 --> 00:56:03.387
application layer. Okay, if

2571
00:56:03.387 --> 00:56:03.947
you're working on the

2572
00:56:03.947 --> 00:56:05.626
application layer, you must

2573
00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:06.686
have a good reason

2574
00:56:06.786 --> 00:56:08.184
right, a deadline, right,

2575
00:56:08.184 --> 00:56:09.224
or maybe you're testing

2576
00:56:09.224 --> 00:56:10.465
something, right, maybe you're

2577
00:56:10.764 --> 00:56:11.623
running some of your

2578
00:56:11.623 --> 00:56:12.764
prompts in the loop

2579
00:56:12.764 --> 00:56:13.762
just to make sure

2580
00:56:13.762 --> 00:56:14.643
that they'll work out

2581
00:56:14.643 --> 00:56:15.782
the loop, okay, or

2582
00:56:15.782 --> 00:56:16.601
else you're moving in

2583
00:56:16.601 --> 00:56:17.722
the wrong direction. You're

2584
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:19.221
going sideways while other

2585
00:56:19.221 --> 00:56:20.760
engineers that have taken

2586
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.000
tactical Agentic that

2587
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.498
understand what's here and

2588
00:56:23.498 --> 00:56:24.438
what's coming next, what

2589
00:56:24.438 --> 00:56:25.797
opportunity is available to

2590
00:56:25.797 --> 00:56:26.858
them, they'll be moving

2591
00:56:26.858 --> 00:56:27.916
up while you'll be

2592
00:56:27.916 --> 00:56:29.516
moving sideways, okay, full

2593
00:56:29.516 --> 00:56:30.775
stop, bar none. What
