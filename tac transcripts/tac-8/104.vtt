2387
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.440
concepts, our leverage points

2388
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.739
and our tactics all

2389
00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:03.679
into a single question.

2390
00:52:03.898 --> 00:52:04.599
This leads us to

2391
00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:05.978
the final question, a

2392
00:52:05.978 --> 00:52:07.778
final meta tactic, if

2393
00:52:07.778 --> 00:52:08.898
you will, that can

2394
00:52:08.918 --> 00:52:10.338
guide you and direct

2395
00:52:10.338 --> 00:52:10.998
you on a daily

2396
00:52:10.998 --> 00:52:13.250
basis. Again, Tactical agentic

2397
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.349
coding. Everything you've done

2398
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:15.969
here, this entire course

2399
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:17.047
has been designed to

2400
00:52:17.047 --> 00:52:18.487
be tactical. These are

2401
00:52:18.487 --> 00:52:19.588
pieces of information you

2402
00:52:19.588 --> 00:52:20.367
can think on a

2403
00:52:20.447 --> 00:52:22.106
daily basis to guide

2404
00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:24.045
you toward great agentic

2405
00:52:24.045 --> 00:52:25.525
coding and therefore agentic

2406
00:52:25.525 --> 00:52:26.326
engineering. This is the

2407
00:52:26.326 --> 00:52:27.105
last question I have

2408
00:52:27.105 --> 00:52:27.644
for you. This is

2409
00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.445
the only thing you

2410
00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:29.525
need if you forget

2411
00:52:29.525 --> 00:52:31.224
everything else. This is
