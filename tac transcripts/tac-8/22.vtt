467
00:10:58.364 --> 00:11:01.101
classes, not one-off fixes,

468
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:02.341
okay? You wanna solve

469
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.899
the class of problems

470
00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:05.158
that you're approaching. And

471
00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:05.859
you can do that

472
00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:07.477
by templating your engineering

473
00:11:07.657 --> 00:11:09.336
inside of these powerful

474
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.174
template meta prompts. This

475
00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:12.254
is a prompt that

476
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.072
generates a prompt. And

477
00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:15.032
then of course, we

478
00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:16.591
can have different variations

479
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.191
of this, right? This

480
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:19.029
is a template that

481
00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:20.369
solves the problem of

482
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:21.888
fixing chores, right? We

483
00:11:21.888 --> 00:11:22.826
can also have one

484
00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:24.826
that ships features. Okay.

485
00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:26.024
And so here we

486
00:11:26.024 --> 00:11:27.083
have more details. We

487
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.423
have more information, but

488
00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:29.163
it's the same idea,

489
00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:30.042
right? We have a
