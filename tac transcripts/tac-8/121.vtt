2773
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.010
we cannot build any

2774
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.510
longer I'll be sharing

2775
01:00:32.641 --> 01:00:35.400
current generation ideas surrounding

2776
01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:37.079
tactical Agentic Coding. I'm

2777
01:00:37.159 --> 01:00:38.278
going to hold off

2778
01:00:38.278 --> 01:00:38.739
on a lot of

2779
01:00:38.739 --> 01:00:40.257
the core ideas from

2780
01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:41.297
the channel. I want

2781
01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:42.157
to give you an

2782
01:00:42.157 --> 01:00:42.657
edge and I want

2783
01:00:42.677 --> 01:00:43.197
to give you a

2784
01:00:43.217 --> 01:00:44.416
time advantage, right? A

2785
01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:46.376
temporal advantage before I

2786
01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.434
start, you know, talking

2787
01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:48.235
about the details of

2788
01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:49.153
this course, talking about

2789
01:00:49.153 --> 01:00:49.813
some of the core

2790
01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.873
concepts and bringing them

2791
01:00:50.873 --> 01:00:51.632
to light so that

2792
01:00:51.632 --> 01:00:52.132
you can have an

2793
01:00:52.132 --> 01:00:53.112
edge here. I'll be

2794
01:00:53.112 --> 01:00:53.972
sharing more about this

2795
01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:55.130
course. I'll be sharing

2796
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:56.791
any potential updates. I'll

2797
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.389
be sharing next potential

2798
01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:00.168
big ideas and whatever's
