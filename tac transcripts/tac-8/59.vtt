WEBVTT

1357
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.279
you can take this.

1358
00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:30.819
Let's go ahead and

1359
00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:31.858
move on to another

1360
00:29:31.858 --> 00:29:33.338
agentic layer. Remember, it's

1361
00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:34.657
all about the agentic

1362
00:29:34.657 --> 00:29:35.497
layer. There's so many

1363
00:29:35.497 --> 00:29:37.176
possibilities here, so many

1364
00:29:37.176 --> 00:29:39.316
combinations, but Here at

1365
00:29:39.316 --> 00:29:40.394
the end of TAC

1366
00:29:40.394 --> 00:29:40.914
8, I just wanna

1367
00:29:40.914 --> 00:29:42.814
give you concrete starting

1368
00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:44.394
places and ideas for

1369
00:29:44.394 --> 00:29:45.492
you to start building

1370
00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:47.452
your agentic layer, prioritize

1371
00:29:47.532 --> 00:29:49.152
your agentic layer. Let's

1372
00:29:49.152 --> 00:29:49.912
go ahead and skip

1373
00:29:50.132 --> 00:29:51.250
app three. I'll let

1374
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:51.851
you open that up

1375
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:52.490
on your own and

1376
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.269
look through that. I

1377
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.990
wanna get to agentic

1378
00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:56.729
prototyping. All right, so

1379
00:29:56.769 --> 00:29:57.229
go ahead and open

1380
00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:57.669
this up. So we're

1381
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:59.087
gonna code this. So

1382
00:29:59.087 --> 00:29:59.708
we have this code

1383
00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:00.626
base here all set
