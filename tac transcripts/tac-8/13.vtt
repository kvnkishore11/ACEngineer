257
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.447
primitives. The agentic layer

258
00:06:30.447 --> 00:06:31.966
primitive codebase is

259
00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:33.509
a simple, empty code

260
00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:34.369
base you can use

261
00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:35.807
to understand and use

262
00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:36.706
as a great starting

263
00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:37.627
point to build out

264
00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:39.444
your agentic layer. Let's

265
00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.165
start with the readme.

266
00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.884
For your minimum viable

267
00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:43.343
agentic layer, you really

268
00:06:43.423 --> 00:06:45.701
only need these pieces.

269
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.779
AI developer workflow directory

270
00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:48.959
and prompts. We're using

271
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:49.997
Claude Code, so we

272
00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:51.216
store our prompts and

273
00:06:51.216 --> 00:06:52.795
.Claude commands. And then

274
00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:54.274
we have our plans.

275
00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:56.274
This is the minimum

276
00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:56.973
set of pieces of

277
00:06:56.973 --> 00:06:57.913
information that you need,

278
00:06:57.913 --> 00:06:58.632
right? Some type of

279
00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.233
scripting layer, right? I
