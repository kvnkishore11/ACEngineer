2475
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.278
layer, prioritize agentics. On

2476
00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:01.099
the day-to-day level, ask

2477
00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:02.418
yourself, what layer am

2478
00:54:02.418 --> 00:54:03.378
I working on? This

2479
00:54:03.378 --> 00:54:04.137
is not the agentic

2480
00:54:04.137 --> 00:54:05.016
layer. I need to

2481
00:54:05.016 --> 00:54:06.097
spend more time working

2482
00:54:06.097 --> 00:54:07.056
on the agentic layer

2483
00:54:07.096 --> 00:54:07.936
so my agents can

2484
00:54:07.936 --> 00:54:08.695
do this work for

2485
00:54:08.695 --> 00:54:09.735
me, okay? That's the

2486
00:54:09.735 --> 00:54:10.715
thought pattern. That's the

2487
00:54:10.715 --> 00:54:11.634
thought chain. That's the

2488
00:54:11.634 --> 00:54:12.873
flow chain. Because once

2489
00:54:12.873 --> 00:54:14.032
you start getting to

2490
00:54:14.032 --> 00:54:15.512
these aha moments, once

2491
00:54:15.512 --> 00:54:16.331
you run a bug

2492
00:54:16.331 --> 00:54:17.490
fix end to end

2493
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.670
with no intervention, once

2494
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:19.449
you run your first

2495
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:20.909
ADW that's useful for

2496
00:54:20.909 --> 00:54:22.588
you, once your teammate

2497
00:54:22.728 --> 00:54:23.708
runs one of your

2498
00:54:23.708 --> 00:54:24.827
ADWs and they say,

2499
00:54:24.827 --> 00:54:26.447
holy, I didn't do

2500
00:54:26.606 --> 00:54:28.005
anything. I just described

2501
00:54:28.005 --> 00:54:29.385
what I wanted and

2502
00:54:29.485 --> 00:54:30.425
it solved the problem.
