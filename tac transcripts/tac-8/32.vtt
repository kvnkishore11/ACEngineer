691
00:15:59.057 --> 00:16:00.136
sure to always add

692
00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:01.277
feedback loops so that

693
00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:02.475
your agent can ship

694
00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:04.195
and auto improve, this

695
00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:05.254
layer becomes more and

696
00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:06.193
more important, more and

697
00:16:06.193 --> 00:16:08.173
more valuable. Nice output

698
00:16:08.173 --> 00:16:09.173
there. We have all

699
00:16:09.173 --> 00:16:10.871
these extraction logs here

700
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:11.312
we can take a

701
00:16:11.312 --> 00:16:12.390
look at. There's that

702
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.150
full breakdown. There's that

703
00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:14.990
sjson array. We've got

704
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.708
the final object and

705
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:18.448
the custom summary that

706
00:16:18.448 --> 00:16:19.727
you can just build,

707
00:16:19.727 --> 00:16:21.004
put together whatever pieces

708
00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:21.663
you want to see.

709
00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:22.681
So again, this layer

710
00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:23.639
of control is really

711
00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:24.657
important. So we can

712
00:16:24.657 --> 00:16:25.394
just keep pushing that

713
00:16:25.394 --> 00:16:26.653
forward, right? So after

714
00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:27.870
you get the prompt,

715
00:16:28.066 --> 00:16:29.125
slightly at the loop

716
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:30.284
and your slash commands
