68
00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:01.102
operate on the agentic

69
00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:02.682
layer much more often

70
00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:03.861
than we operate on

71
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:05.400
the application layer. At

72
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.840
the end of this

73
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.099
course, there'll be a

74
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.938
single guiding question you

75
00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:10.098
can use to know

76
00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.018
whether you're moving in

77
00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:12.457
the right direction or

78
00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:14.157
not. This guiding question

79
00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:15.515
represents the oil of

80
00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:16.875
this course. All the

81
00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:18.693
Agentic KPIs, every

82
00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:20.651
tactic, it compresses all

83
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:21.131
of it into a

84
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:22.649
single question. When I

85
00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:23.448
set out to create

86
00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:24.387
this course, I wanted

87
00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:26.645
to create a tactical

88
00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.664
day to day useful

89
00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.084
set of information for
