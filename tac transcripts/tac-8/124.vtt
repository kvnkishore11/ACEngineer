2843
01:01:59.896 --> 01:02:00.815
on that day in

2844
01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:01.735
the future, you sit

2845
01:02:01.735 --> 01:02:03.653
down, you start tinkering,

2846
01:02:03.793 --> 01:02:05.193
right? You're building something

2847
01:02:05.273 --> 01:02:06.012
just for the love

2848
01:02:06.012 --> 01:02:06.931
of it, right? For

2849
01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:08.170
no other reason other

2850
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.190
than fun. You start

2851
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:10.570
reminiscing about this period

2852
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:11.469
in your life when

2853
01:02:11.469 --> 01:02:13.248
everything started changing. And

2854
01:02:13.248 --> 01:02:14.608
you say this, when

2855
01:02:14.608 --> 01:02:16.565
the agents arrived, something

2856
01:02:16.565 --> 01:02:18.650
changed. We weren't just

2857
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:20.469
AI coding anymore. We

2858
01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:24.686
started orchestrating intelligence. This

2859
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:26.025
closes the loop on

2860
01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.864
Tactical Agentic Coding. In

2861
01:02:27.864 --> 01:02:29.224
a sea of noise,

2862
01:02:29.364 --> 01:02:30.963
slop, thank you for
