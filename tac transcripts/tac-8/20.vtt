420
00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:00.886
what we have here

421
00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:02.246
is very, very powerful.

422
00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:04.566
We have plan format.

423
00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:05.686
Do not underestimate the

424
00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:06.904
plan format. We're having

425
00:10:06.904 --> 00:10:08.585
our agents do work.

426
00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:09.703
They're researching the code

427
00:10:09.703 --> 00:10:10.844
base and they're going

428
00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.462
to plan work, create

429
00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:13.543
a plan to complete

430
00:10:13.543 --> 00:10:14.783
the chore described. And

431
00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:15.361
so this is a

432
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:17.941
V1 template meta prompt

433
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.700
that you can use

434
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.519
to get started automating

435
00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.758
work inside your code

436
00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:22.956
base. This is powerful

437
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:23.895
because we're taking a

438
00:10:23.895 --> 00:10:25.315
high level prompt that

439
00:10:25.315 --> 00:10:26.754
will pass into this

440
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.553
and then our agent

441
00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:28.613
will do the research

442
00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.991
on our behalf, right?

443
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:30.711
