1334
00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:00.403
we can just search

1335
00:29:00.403 --> 00:29:01.622
positive and you can

1336
00:29:01.622 --> 00:29:02.521
see that's all we

1337
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:03.580
have here. If we

1338
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.500
regex search negative, we

1339
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.637
have absolutely nothing, okay?

1340
00:29:08.769 --> 00:29:09.809
Great, our filter tweet

1341
00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:10.969
worked. You can see

1342
00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:11.808
code came in and

1343
00:29:11.828 --> 00:29:13.008
operated here on this

1344
00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:14.586
work tree and we

1345
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.126
added 50 new tweets.

1346
00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.246
And right now another

1347
00:29:17.246 --> 00:29:18.125
agent is building out

1348
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.845
an augmented training model

1349
00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:21.364
using both original and

1350
00:29:21.364 --> 00:29:23.042
filtered training sets. So

1351
00:29:23.042 --> 00:29:23.982
it's using both of

1352
00:29:23.982 --> 00:29:24.922
these now, right? So

1353
00:29:24.922 --> 00:29:25.922
it's stacking on the

1354
00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:26.821
work that's been done.

1355
00:29:26.921 --> 00:29:28.181
Lots of places, lots

1356
00:29:28.181 --> 00:29:29.940
of ways and directions

1357
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.279
you can take this.
