2239
00:48:29.001 --> 00:48:30.161
ID back into this

2240
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:31.539
agent to continue the

2241
00:48:31.539 --> 00:48:32.739
conversation, okay? This is

2242
00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:33.958
the only exception to

2243
00:48:33.958 --> 00:48:35.597
that. Every other prompt

2244
00:48:35.597 --> 00:48:36.655
we ran, we have

2245
00:48:36.695 --> 00:48:37.815
one agent, one prompt,

2246
00:48:37.934 --> 00:48:38.954
one purpose, and I

2247
00:48:38.954 --> 00:48:40.253
recommend that for the

2248
00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:41.333
majority of your agent

2249
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:42.990
decoding. This creates focus

2250
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.989
agents, focus context windows,

2251
00:48:45.153 --> 00:48:46.353
that are reproducible and

2252
00:48:46.353 --> 00:48:48.271
easily testable, validatable, and

2253
00:48:48.271 --> 00:48:49.949
improvable. Where does this

2254
00:48:49.949 --> 00:48:50.927
all end up? It

2255
00:48:50.967 --> 00:48:52.507
ends up with zero

2256
00:48:52.525 --> 00:48:53.804
touch engineering. This is

2257
00:48:53.804 --> 00:48:54.943
your North Star. This

2258
00:48:54.943 --> 00:48:56.202
is the lesson seven

2259
00:48:56.202 --> 00:48:58.440
tactic. Target zero touch

2260
00:48:58.621 --> 00:49:00.400
engineering. As you progress
