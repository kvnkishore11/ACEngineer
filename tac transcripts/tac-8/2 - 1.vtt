29
00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.753
the system, that builds

30
00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:02.154
the system, we're talking

31
00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:03.832
about the new agentic

32
00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:05.513
layer of your codebase.

33
00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.052
Imagine a ring around

34
00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:08.971
your codebase. At first

35
00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:09.932
it's thin, then it

36
00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:11.290
becomes thicker as you

37
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.391
scale agentics into your

38
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.430
codebase. Machines that operate

39
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.290
with your judgment, shipping

40
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.902
your way getting work

41
00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.320
done autonomously in your

42
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.400
product. In this agentic

43
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.438
layer, this is where

44
00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.138
you template your engineering

45
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.617
and teach your product

46
00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:29.516
to build itself. This

47
00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:31.055
course in its essence
