2123
00:45:59.583 --> 00:46:00.184
this to zero. You

2124
00:46:00.184 --> 00:46:01.523
wanna stay out the

2125
00:46:01.523 --> 00:46:03.242
loop. There's in-loop agent

2126
00:46:03.242 --> 00:46:04.802
decoding and there's out-loop

2127
00:46:04.922 --> 00:46:06.302
Agentic. More and

2128
00:46:06.302 --> 00:46:07.461
more as you progress,

2129
00:46:07.461 --> 00:46:08.202
as you build up

2130
00:46:08.222 --> 00:46:09.101
the agentic layer of

2131
00:46:09.101 --> 00:46:10.273
your codebase, You

2132
00:46:10.273 --> 00:46:11.253
wanna be staying out

2133
00:46:11.253 --> 00:46:11.853
the loop. You wanna

2134
00:46:11.853 --> 00:46:13.132
be building the system

2135
00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:14.652
that builds the system.

2136
00:46:14.652 --> 00:46:17.030
That underlines everything we've

2137
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.210
done here and everything

2138
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.269
you can do now.

2139
00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:21.228
Stay out the loop.

2140
00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:22.369
And how do we

2141
00:46:22.369 --> 00:46:23.248
ensure that we can

2142
00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:24.347
do that? We tap

2143
00:46:24.347 --> 00:46:24.947
into one of the

2144
00:46:25.047 --> 00:46:27.126
critical leverage points. We

2145
00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:28.565
always add feedback loops.

2146
00:46:28.565 --> 00:46:30.409
We add tests. Okay,
