00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:30.104
This tactic represents all

127
00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:32.002
others, from target zero-touch

128
00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:33.532
engineering all the way

129
00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:35.004
back to stop coding.

130
00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:37.123
All tactics are compressed

131
00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:39.282
into this tactic. Prioritize

132
00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:41.741
your agentic layer. Prioritize

133
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:43.219
agentics. The trick of

134
00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.438
this tactic is that

135
00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:45.717
it will fluctuate, but

136
00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:46.836
as a general rule,

137
00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:47.676
the more time you

138
00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.175
invest into your agentic

139
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:50.715
layer, the thicker you

140
00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:51.954
make that layer around

141
00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:52.932
your codebase, the

142
00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.491
more your agentic layer

143
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:55.032
will be able to

144
00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:57.689
solve problem classes on

145
00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:58.868
your behalf. As a

146
00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:00.048
good starting point, I
