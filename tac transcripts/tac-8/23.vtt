489
00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:30.042
right? We have a

490
00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:31.500
prompt, we have instructions,

491
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:32.779
we have code-based structure,

492
00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:33.179
and then we have

493
00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:34.619
the plan format. Okay.

494
00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:35.778
This is all familiar.

495
00:11:35.817 --> 00:11:37.057
We've worked on this.

496
00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.056
These are key parts

497
00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:39.294
of the 12 leverage

498
00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:40.714
points of Agenda coding.

499
00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:41.933
We have the in-agent

500
00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:44.032
leverage points, the core

501
00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:45.890
four context model prompt

502
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:47.210
and tools. And then

503
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.749
we scale that further,

504
00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.268
right? You have specs,

505
00:11:50.368 --> 00:11:51.846
you have templates and

506
00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:54.321
you have ADWs. So

507
00:11:54.321 --> 00:11:54.840
let's talk about the

508
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.158
highest abstraction level. Once

509
00:11:57.158 --> 00:11:57.996
you start collecting your

510
00:11:57.996 --> 00:11:58.936
prompts, once you start

511
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:00.754
using them right in
