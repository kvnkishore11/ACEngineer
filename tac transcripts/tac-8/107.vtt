2454
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:30.411
with fleets of agents

2455
00:53:30.411 --> 00:53:32.250
that solve problem classes

2456
00:53:32.269 --> 00:53:34.409
completely outperforms an engineer

2457
00:53:34.409 --> 00:53:36.128
using classical AI coding,

2458
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:38.128
classical in-loop Agentic Coding,

2459
00:53:38.168 --> 00:53:39.288
okay? You will not

2460
00:53:39.288 --> 00:53:40.288
be able to compete,

2461
00:53:40.288 --> 00:53:41.307
okay? There is no

2462
00:53:41.307 --> 00:53:42.666
competing with an agentic

2463
00:53:42.666 --> 00:53:44.146
engineer. You must have

2464
00:53:44.146 --> 00:53:45.726
fleets of agents operating

2465
00:53:45.726 --> 00:53:46.965
on your behalf to

2466
00:53:46.965 --> 00:53:48.144
compete with an agentic

2467
00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:49.425
engineer. Now, the most

2468
00:53:49.425 --> 00:53:50.083
important thing you can

2469
00:53:50.083 --> 00:53:51.204
do next after you

2470
00:53:51.204 --> 00:53:52.302
finish this course, this

2471
00:53:52.302 --> 00:53:53.362
final lesson here in

2472
00:53:53.362 --> 00:53:55.322
our last five, 10,

2473
00:53:55.461 --> 00:53:56.780
30 minutes together here

2474
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.880
is invest in this

2475
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.278
layer, prioritize agentics. On
