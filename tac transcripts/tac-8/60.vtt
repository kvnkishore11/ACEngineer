1383
00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:00.626
base here all set

1384
00:30:00.626 --> 00:30:02.606
up. And what does

1385
00:30:02.606 --> 00:30:03.586
this do? What is

1386
00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:05.382
agentic prototyping? prototyping do.

1387
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:06.481
This one's really cool.

1388
00:30:06.481 --> 00:30:07.621
We're fully out the

1389
00:30:07.621 --> 00:30:09.161
loop here. Prototyping is

1390
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:10.340
ultra important with the

1391
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.660
insane pace of innovation

1392
00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:13.900
in the tech ecosystem.

1393
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.319
You want to be

1394
00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.519
able to prototype quickly.

1395
00:30:15.858 --> 00:30:16.659
We can of course

1396
00:30:16.699 --> 00:30:17.919
throw agents at this

1397
00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:19.577
problem. So I have

1398
00:30:19.857 --> 00:30:21.117
a notion page here.

1399
00:30:21.218 --> 00:30:22.977
and already you understand

1400
00:30:22.977 --> 00:30:24.894
what this does already,

1401
00:30:25.015 --> 00:30:26.433
right? We have an

1402
00:30:26.433 --> 00:30:27.932
agentic prototyper as a

1403
00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:29.571
notion database in the

1404
00:30:29.571 --> 00:30:30.790
board view, okay? So
