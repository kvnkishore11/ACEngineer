1923
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.760
all together. This is

1924
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.179
the lower level atoms

1925
00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:33.797
that we compose together

1926
00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:35.257
while using great leverage

1927
00:41:35.257 --> 00:41:36.817
points of Agentic Coding.

1928
00:41:37.016 --> 00:41:37.956
So it's all here.

1929
00:41:38.117 --> 00:41:38.715
I'm not gonna go

1930
00:41:38.715 --> 00:41:39.275
into this in too

1931
00:41:39.275 --> 00:41:40.036
much detail, but you

1932
00:41:40.036 --> 00:41:40.695
can imagine how this

1933
00:41:40.695 --> 00:41:42.335
works. You understand this

1934
00:41:42.335 --> 00:41:43.355
layer. We've been working

1935
00:41:43.355 --> 00:41:43.833
on this. We've been

1936
00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:45.173
talking about this. right,

1937
00:41:45.273 --> 00:41:46.711
ADW trigger, we have

1938
00:41:46.711 --> 00:41:48.909
a dedicated agent embedded

1939
00:41:48.909 --> 00:41:51.047
application server so that

1940
00:41:51.047 --> 00:41:52.184
we can access this

1941
00:41:52.425 --> 00:41:53.664
outside the loop. In

1942
00:41:53.664 --> 00:41:55.661
this case, outside the

1943
00:41:55.661 --> 00:41:57.240
loop is inside the

1944
00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.099
application. Okay, so there

1945
00:41:59.099 --> 00:41:59.778
are many ways you

1946
00:41:59.778 --> 00:42:00.677
can play with this.
