1309
00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:30.476
CD trees or actually

1310
00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:31.355
I'll do this. I'll

1311
00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:33.895
do code trees and

1312
00:28:33.895 --> 00:28:34.655
then I'll paste this

1313
00:28:34.675 --> 00:28:35.496
in and we're going

1314
00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:36.076
to open this up

1315
00:28:36.096 --> 00:28:37.016
and check this out.

1316
00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:37.795
Right. So we have

1317
00:28:37.815 --> 00:28:39.555
a sparse checkout of

1318
00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:41.535
just this directory, just

1319
00:28:41.535 --> 00:28:42.255
this codebase that

1320
00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:43.194
we're operating in. Right.

1321
00:28:43.194 --> 00:28:44.474
So it's a entire

1322
00:28:44.474 --> 00:28:46.253
copy of this environment

1323
00:28:46.253 --> 00:28:47.294
of this codebase

1324
00:28:47.334 --> 00:28:48.713
for this agent to

1325
00:28:48.713 --> 00:28:50.409
do just this set

1326
00:28:50.409 --> 00:28:51.288
of work in, right?

1327
00:28:51.388 --> 00:28:52.107
So let's look for

1328
00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:54.067
this tweets positive only

1329
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:55.185
that will come up

1330
00:28:55.205 --> 00:28:56.545
probably pretty quickly. There

1331
00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:57.625
it is, tweets positive

1332
00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:58.624
only, right? If we

1333
00:28:58.624 --> 00:28:59.742
look at the sentiment,

1334
00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:00.403
we can just search
