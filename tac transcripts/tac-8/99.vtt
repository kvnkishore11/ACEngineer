2284
00:49:29.547 --> 00:49:30.507
black and white in

2285
00:49:30.507 --> 00:49:32.166
engineering. There's gray, there's

2286
00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:33.885
progression, there's one day

2287
00:49:33.885 --> 00:49:34.525
at a time, one

2288
00:49:34.525 --> 00:49:35.385
step at a time.

2289
00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:36.666
So at first you'll

2290
00:49:36.666 --> 00:49:38.445
just solve simple small

2291
00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:39.465
chores end to end

2292
00:49:39.465 --> 00:49:40.744
and then eventually you'll

2293
00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:42.264
realize you don't need

2294
00:49:42.264 --> 00:49:43.563
to validate this type

2295
00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:44.704
of work and because

2296
00:49:44.704 --> 00:49:45.762
you always add feedback

2297
00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:46.643
loops and you have

2298
00:49:46.643 --> 00:49:48.663
a concrete review step

2299
00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:49.942
that you've taught your

2300
00:49:49.942 --> 00:49:51.581
agents how to use,

2301
00:49:51.746 --> 00:49:52.625
right, maybe it's images,

2302
00:49:52.625 --> 00:49:53.804
maybe it's videos, maybe

2303
00:49:53.804 --> 00:49:55.483
it's a multi-step review

2304
00:49:55.483 --> 00:49:57.543
system, a multi-step review,

2305
00:49:57.603 --> 00:49:58.862
ad developer workflow, whatever

2306
00:49:58.862 --> 00:49:59.760
it is, right, remember

2307
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.201
you have all the
