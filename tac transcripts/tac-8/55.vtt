WEBVTT

1261
00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:30.893
can see here, we

1262
00:27:30.972 --> 00:27:33.551
divided up our ADWs

1263
00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:34.051
and a couple of

1264
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:35.351
sub directories, just making

1265
00:27:35.351 --> 00:27:36.290
things a little easier

1266
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.269
to work with, right?

1267
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.910
You will get to

1268
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.729
a point where your

1269
00:27:38.749 --> 00:27:40.928
ADWs in itself, in

1270
00:27:40.948 --> 00:27:42.028
combination with your prompts,

1271
00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:43.027
is its own kind

1272
00:27:43.027 --> 00:27:44.426
of micro codebase,

1273
00:27:44.426 --> 00:27:45.586
right? A wrangle layer

1274
00:27:45.605 --> 00:27:46.726
around your codebase.

1275
00:27:46.924 --> 00:27:47.505
And so you do

1276
00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:48.505
want to put good

1277
00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:49.963
engineering patterns and practices

1278
00:27:49.963 --> 00:27:50.883
as you scale it

1279
00:27:50.923 --> 00:27:51.942
up, but keep it

1280
00:27:51.942 --> 00:27:54.221
separated from apps. Okay,

1281
00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:55.560
keep it isolated and

1282
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.880
separated. This is not

1283
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.298
the application layer, make

1284
00:27:58.298 --> 00:27:59.519
that clear. So let's

1285
00:27:59.519 --> 00:27:59.978
go ahead and take

1286
00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:00.897
a look at what's
