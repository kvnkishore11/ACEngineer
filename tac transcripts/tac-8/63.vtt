1456
00:31:29.785 --> 00:31:31.144
job that is going

1457
00:31:31.144 --> 00:31:32.763
to execute. Let's go

1458
00:31:32.763 --> 00:31:33.583
ahead and run UV

1459
00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:35.741
run, fire this off.

1460
00:31:35.862 --> 00:31:37.141
and we're gonna monitor

1461
00:31:37.141 --> 00:31:38.040
and pick up Notion

1462
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.960
tasks every 15 seconds.

1463
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.740
And let me actually

1464
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.719
just reset this. And

1465
00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:42.038
let me just do

1466
00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:42.778
this a faster way.

1467
00:31:42.778 --> 00:31:43.278
I'm gonna pass in

1468
00:31:43.278 --> 00:31:44.417
the once flag. Use

1469
00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:45.497
this for quickly testing.

1470
00:31:45.497 --> 00:31:46.116
It's just gonna run

1471
00:31:46.116 --> 00:31:47.655
the workflow one time

1472
00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:48.355
and just pick up

1473
00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:49.276
as many tasks as

1474
00:31:49.276 --> 00:31:50.335
it can. So yet

1475
00:31:50.335 --> 00:31:52.634
again, another configuration of

1476
00:31:52.634 --> 00:31:53.673
your agentic layer. I'm

1477
00:31:53.814 --> 00:31:54.532
not gonna dive into

1478
00:31:54.532 --> 00:31:55.532
this one. I think

1479
00:31:55.673 --> 00:31:56.612
you're getting the pattern.

1480
00:31:56.612 --> 00:31:57.392
You're starting to understand

1481
00:31:57.392 --> 00:31:58.351
what's happening. If you

1482
00:31:58.351 --> 00:31:58.871
ever wanna find the

1483
00:31:58.871 --> 00:32:00.010
prompt, you just look
