1994
00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:01.090
that can operate your

1995
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.530
domain, that can operate

1996
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.068
your problem set better

1997
00:43:04.088 --> 00:43:05.429
and faster than you

1998
00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:06.309
or any engineer on

1999
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:07.148
your team can, right?

2000
00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:07.748
And that's the whole

2001
00:43:07.748 --> 00:43:09.307
point, right? Template your

2002
00:43:09.307 --> 00:43:10.668
engineering, give your agents

2003
00:43:10.726 --> 00:43:12.367
your capabilities so that

2004
00:43:12.367 --> 00:43:13.447
you can focus on

2005
00:43:13.586 --> 00:43:14.666
the more strategic, higher

2006
00:43:14.666 --> 00:43:15.326
level decisions so you

2007
00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:15.846
can move up the

2008
00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:17.626
stack, okay? So let's

2009
00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:20.085
recenter around tactical agentic

2010
00:43:20.085 --> 00:43:21.065
coding. What has this

2011
00:43:21.085 --> 00:43:22.443
all been about? We

2012
00:43:22.443 --> 00:43:23.143
set out on a

2013
00:43:23.143 --> 00:43:24.804
single mission to become

2014
00:43:24.804 --> 00:43:25.802
an engineer that can't

2015
00:43:25.802 --> 00:43:27.822
replace. Here in lesson

2016
00:43:27.882 --> 00:43:29.442
eight of tactical agentic

2017
00:43:29.442 --> 00:43:30.621
coding, you now have
