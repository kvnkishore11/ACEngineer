325
00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:01.994
the ADW's directory. If

326
00:08:01.994 --> 00:08:03.334
you're just operating with

327
00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:05.093
prompts, you're missing out

328
00:08:05.213 --> 00:08:07.312
on tons of capabilities,

329
00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:07.932
right? You're missing out

330
00:08:07.932 --> 00:08:09.093
on tons of workflows.

331
00:08:09.093 --> 00:08:09.973
So what does a

332
00:08:09.973 --> 00:08:11.632
minimum agentic layer look

333
00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:12.752
like? You can always

334
00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:14.391
start with a simple

335
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:16.572
prime command, okay? This

336
00:08:16.572 --> 00:08:17.951
just sets your agent

337
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:18.632
up and it's a

338
00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:19.951
prompt you can reuse

339
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.331
and any one of

340
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:22.550
your other prompts if

341
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.411
you need to, to

342
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:24.350
get your agent ready

343
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.391
to work. And as

344
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:25.971
you know, we can

345
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.189
always fire this off.

346
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.930
We can start a

347
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.553
Claude instance here. We

348
00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:30.892
can run slash prime.
