1570
00:33:59.395 --> 00:34:00.674
very powerful, very useful,

1571
00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:01.355
but we can go

1572
00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:03.374
even further, right? Specialize,

1573
00:34:03.413 --> 00:34:04.712
right? Do something, take

1574
00:34:04.732 --> 00:34:05.752
care of some type

1575
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:06.952
of engineering work, right?

1576
00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:07.971
That's what your ADWs

1577
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:09.291
and your prompts should

1578
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:10.190
do. Solve a real

1579
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.490
problem. Let's look at

1580
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.269
our UV MCP. Okay.

1581
00:34:13.269 --> 00:34:14.329
And so what does

1582
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:15.130
this do? This is

1583
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.409
another template meta prompt,

1584
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:17.568
but instead here we

1585
00:34:17.568 --> 00:34:18.668
have another variable that's

1586
00:34:18.668 --> 00:34:19.929
going to get created

1587
00:34:20.188 --> 00:34:20.929
on the fly here

1588
00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.728
by our agent. And

1589
00:34:21.728 --> 00:34:22.307
what's going to happen

1590
00:34:22.307 --> 00:34:23.807
here is we have

1591
00:34:23.807 --> 00:34:25.847
a dedicated workflow and

1592
00:34:26.007 --> 00:34:27.306
we have some additional

1593
00:34:27.327 --> 00:34:28.507
AI docs, right? So

1594
00:34:28.507 --> 00:34:29.306
this is another kind

1595
00:34:29.306 --> 00:34:31.427
of important auxiliary directory,
