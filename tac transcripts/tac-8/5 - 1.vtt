89
00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.084
set of information for

90
00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:30.984
you. And that's what

91
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.022
I've done here at

92
00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.322
the end of one

93
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:34.521
last question for you

94
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.001
that represents this entire

95
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.100
course, but we have

96
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.180
important ideas to discuss

97
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.139
before we get there.

98
00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.098
In this lesson, we'll

99
00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:42.698
work through four unique

100
00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:44.197
codebases, each with

101
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.896
their own agentic layer.

102
00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:47.195
The whole point here

103
00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:47.776
is to give you

104
00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.694
hands on quick starts

105
00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:50.473
you can use to

106
00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:52.533
build that V1, that

107
00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.293
proof of concept, that

108
00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.909
minimum viable agentic layer

109
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.068
of your codebase.

110
00:02:58.147 --> 00:02:59.585
Let's cover your final

111
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.181
tactic of Agentic Coding.
