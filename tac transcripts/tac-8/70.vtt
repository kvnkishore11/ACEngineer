1617
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.454
this to whatever type

1618
00:35:00.454 --> 00:35:01.014
of codebase you

1619
00:35:01.014 --> 00:35:02.452
want to prototype, right?

1620
00:35:02.512 --> 00:35:03.373
You can imagine how

1621
00:35:03.373 --> 00:35:04.492
useful this can be.

1622
00:35:04.592 --> 00:35:05.192
And so let's go

1623
00:35:05.192 --> 00:35:05.831
ahead and just quickly

1624
00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:06.490
check in on our

1625
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.869
task. In progress, not

1626
00:35:07.869 --> 00:35:09.409
started, that's fine. Looks

1627
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:09.909
like we picked up

1628
00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:10.829
three. So you can

1629
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:11.708
see here, we have

1630
00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:13.967
plans successfully created, plan,

1631
00:35:14.047 --> 00:35:14.867
JSON format or bun

1632
00:35:14.867 --> 00:35:16.367
script, looks great. We

1633
00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:17.485
have, right, we have

1634
00:35:17.485 --> 00:35:18.625
another agent getting kicked

1635
00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:20.045
off here, UV watch

1636
00:35:20.045 --> 00:35:21.643
file, so on and

1637
00:35:21.643 --> 00:35:22.304
so on. forth right

1638
00:35:22.304 --> 00:35:24.164
uv plan script and

1639
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.543
our agents are just

1640
00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:26.523
going to progress here

1641
00:35:26.523 --> 00:35:27.284
I'll probably skip through

1642
00:35:27.284 --> 00:35:27.784
some of this to

1643
00:35:27.784 --> 00:35:28.862
save some time but

1644
00:35:28.862 --> 00:35:29.242
you can see the

1645
00:35:29.242 --> 00:35:29.943
workflow right let me

1646
00:35:29.943 --> 00:35:30.443
zoom out a little
