00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:30.096
about tactics that you

535
00:12:30.096 --> 00:12:31.754
can use to agentic

536
00:12:31.754 --> 00:12:32.894
code. And one key

537
00:12:32.894 --> 00:12:34.974
concept, the highest level

538
00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:36.712
of abstraction is the

539
00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:38.052
AI developer workflow. We

540
00:12:38.052 --> 00:12:40.630
have a dedicated directory

541
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.129
that uses these prompts.

542
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.308
Here, our agentic layer

543
00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:45.629
really starts to take

544
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:46.607
shape and starts to

545
00:12:46.607 --> 00:12:48.606
take form. A great

546
00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:49.547
place to start here

547
00:12:49.606 --> 00:12:50.426
is just the ADW

548
00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:52.086
prompt. You can literally

549
00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:53.065
just come in here

550
00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:55.183
and prompt against your

551
00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.504
agent. And this script

552
00:12:56.504 --> 00:12:57.464
is super simple. It's

553
00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.102
got really great concise

554
00:12:59.102 --> 00:12:59.942
logging. You can use

555
00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:01.543
this to understand where
