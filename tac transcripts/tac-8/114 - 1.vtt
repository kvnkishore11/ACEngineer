2613
00:56:57.324 --> 00:57:00.123
commoditization of engineering, okay?

2614
00:57:00.262 --> 00:57:01.021
AI coding is not

2615
00:57:01.021 --> 00:57:02.581
enough. With Agentic Coding,

2616
00:57:02.722 --> 00:57:04.081
not only is code

2617
00:57:04.081 --> 00:57:05.119
a commodity, but the

2618
00:57:05.159 --> 00:57:07.059
implementation as well. This

2619
00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:08.139
is only a net

2620
00:57:08.139 --> 00:57:09.338
negative if you show

2621
00:57:09.338 --> 00:57:09.938
up late to the

2622
00:57:09.938 --> 00:57:11.257
party. You are here

2623
00:57:11.277 --> 00:57:12.697
very early. It might

2624
00:57:12.697 --> 00:57:13.416
not feel like it,

2625
00:57:13.476 --> 00:57:14.635
but you're here early.

2626
00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:15.335
Allow me to help

2627
00:57:15.335 --> 00:57:16.235
you step out the

2628
00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:17.574
tech bubble. You know,

2629
00:57:17.574 --> 00:57:18.393
you and I both

2630
00:57:18.393 --> 00:57:19.434
live in. You are

2631
00:57:19.434 --> 00:57:20.713
early, okay? You have

2632
00:57:20.713 --> 00:57:22.251
this information. The value

2633
00:57:22.251 --> 00:57:23.871
of engineering is actively

2634
00:57:23.871 --> 00:57:24.971
moving up the stack

2635
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.750
to system design, system

2636
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:29.108
architecture, encoding your domain

2637
00:57:29.108 --> 00:57:31.027
expertise for your agents,
