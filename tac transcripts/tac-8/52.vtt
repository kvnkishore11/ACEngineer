1183
00:25:59.222 --> 00:26:00.363
see there, we initialize

1184
00:26:00.363 --> 00:26:01.522
the work tree. That's

1185
00:26:01.522 --> 00:26:03.261
one important piece. And

1186
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:03.781
then we of course

1187
00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:05.193
just call build. right

1188
00:26:05.193 --> 00:26:06.292
slash build with the

1189
00:26:06.292 --> 00:26:07.333
task. It does the

1190
00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:08.452
work, writes the commit

1191
00:26:08.452 --> 00:26:09.292
message and we can,

1192
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:09.832
you know, look at

1193
00:26:09.832 --> 00:26:10.791
build here. All of

1194
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:11.451
this can be done

1195
00:26:11.672 --> 00:26:12.691
in the loop, but

1196
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.270
that's just the place

1197
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.050
you want to start.

1198
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.950
Okay. Of course it

1199
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.430
can be done in

1200
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.069
the loop, right? This

1201
00:26:17.069 --> 00:26:17.990
is the lowest hanging

1202
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.808
fruit of Agentic Coding.

1203
00:26:19.969 --> 00:26:20.888
Course you can open

1204
00:26:20.888 --> 00:26:21.688
up and just write

1205
00:26:21.688 --> 00:26:22.468
the prompt yourself, right?

1206
00:26:22.468 --> 00:26:22.907
And do the work

1207
00:26:22.907 --> 00:26:24.106
yourself, but that's not

1208
00:26:24.106 --> 00:26:24.747
the point. You can't

1209
00:26:24.747 --> 00:26:26.366
scale that way. Okay.

1210
00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:30.116
Remember prioritize Agentics. Prioritize
