00:39:29.195 --> 00:39:30.496
check your loot box

1840
00:39:30.655 --> 00:39:31.335
all this is going

1841
00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:31.856
to be available to

1842
00:39:31.856 --> 00:39:33.496
you don't fixate on

1843
00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:35.994
the exact details focus

1844
00:39:36.235 --> 00:39:38.155
on the agentic layer

1845
00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:40.394
okay prioritize your agentic

1846
00:39:40.635 --> 00:39:41.614
layer let's look through

1847
00:39:41.614 --> 00:39:42.675
one more example and

1848
00:39:42.675 --> 00:39:43.934
then let's set the

1849
00:39:43.934 --> 00:39:45.974
table for the current

1850
00:39:45.974 --> 00:39:48.275
phase of Agentic Coding

1851
00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:48.855
that we're in the

1852
00:39:48.855 --> 00:39:50.853
current age of agents

1853
00:39:50.974 --> 00:39:52.074
okay so let's wrap

1854
00:39:52.074 --> 00:39:52.974
up one more example

1855
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:53.914
I have something exciting

1856
00:39:53.914 --> 00:39:54.353
that I want to

1857
00:39:54.353 --> 00:39:55.313
share with you here

1858
00:39:55.353 --> 00:39:56.014
if we open up

1859
00:39:56.014 --> 00:39:57.693
our last example here

1860
00:39:57.826 --> 00:39:59.605
we have something familiar

1861
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:01.123
that you've seen before.
