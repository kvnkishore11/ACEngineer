397
00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:30.201
your codebase, restarting

398
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:31.279
processes, so on and

399
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.259
so forth. And then

400
00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:32.739
we get to the

401
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.759
interesting bits. So we

402
00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:35.258
have a implement command.

403
00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:36.076
Remember, this is a

404
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.096
higher order prompt. It's

405
00:09:38.096 --> 00:09:39.134
a prompt that takes

406
00:09:39.134 --> 00:09:40.714
another prompt as an

407
00:09:40.774 --> 00:09:42.192
argument, right? We pass

408
00:09:42.192 --> 00:09:43.211
this into the prompt.

409
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:44.150
And then of course,

410
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.529
we have a very

411
00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:46.948
important piece of the

412
00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:48.947
agentic layer, your templates.

413
00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:50.407
These are meta prompts.

414
00:09:50.486 --> 00:09:52.309
They template out what

415
00:09:52.309 --> 00:09:54.188
your engineering workflows look

416
00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:55.068
like. Okay, if we

417
00:09:55.068 --> 00:09:56.469
collapse everything here, you

418
00:09:56.469 --> 00:09:57.528
can see a classical

419
00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:59.668
markdown prompt structure. And

420
00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:00.886
what we have here
