1527
00:32:57.798 --> 00:33:00.178
possible agentic capabilities, right?

1528
00:33:00.397 --> 00:33:01.017
Now it doesn't tell

1529
00:33:01.017 --> 00:33:02.096
the full story, right?

1530
00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:02.836
This won't tell the

1531
00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:03.895
full story. If you're

1532
00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:06.154
bouncing your deterministic code

1533
00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:08.214
with your non-deterministic agentic

1534
00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:09.574
prompts inside of your

1535
00:33:09.574 --> 00:33:10.692
ADWs, right, you're going

1536
00:33:10.692 --> 00:33:11.432
to need to read

1537
00:33:11.492 --> 00:33:12.272
both of these to

1538
00:33:12.272 --> 00:33:13.172
get the full story.

1539
00:33:13.412 --> 00:33:14.711
But the primitives here,

1540
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:16.270
right, the atoms of

1541
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.150
Agentic Coding, they are

1542
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.077
your prompts. This is

1543
00:33:20.077 --> 00:33:20.817
part of the core

1544
00:33:20.817 --> 00:33:21.797
four. This is part

1545
00:33:21.797 --> 00:33:22.875
of the in-agent system

1546
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:24.355
for a reason and

1547
00:33:24.355 --> 00:33:25.734
a through-agent leverage point

1548
00:33:25.734 --> 00:33:27.013
is because everything is

1549
00:33:27.013 --> 00:33:28.413
based on this, right?

1550
00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:30.872
Plans, prompts, templates, ADWs,
