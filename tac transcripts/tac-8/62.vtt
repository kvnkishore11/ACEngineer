WEBVTT

1428
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.000
to operate inside the

1429
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.898
trees directory, which doesn't

1430
00:31:02.898 --> 00:31:04.058
exist yet here, right?

1431
00:31:04.058 --> 00:31:04.999
We're gonna use dedicated

1432
00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:06.198
Git work trees. And

1433
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:06.577
then we have the

1434
00:31:06.577 --> 00:31:07.998
review system. And so

1435
00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:08.757
the review system is

1436
00:31:08.777 --> 00:31:09.856
gonna be both the

1437
00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:11.316
actual codebase results

1438
00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:12.394
right inside the editor.

1439
00:31:12.394 --> 00:31:13.315
And we're gonna get

1440
00:31:13.315 --> 00:31:14.874
high level reviews as

1441
00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:16.032
these tasks progress. So

1442
00:31:16.032 --> 00:31:16.452
let me just go

1443
00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:16.972
ahead and kick this

1444
00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:17.811
off and it'll all

1445
00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:18.592
make sense. If you

1446
00:31:18.592 --> 00:31:19.790
wanna understand the agentic

1447
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.790
layer, you open up

1448
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.669
ADWs, okay? And if

1449
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:23.229
you wanna stay out

1450
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:23.769
the loop and look

1451
00:31:23.769 --> 00:31:24.768
for that starting point,

1452
00:31:24.827 --> 00:31:25.647
you open up the

1453
00:31:25.647 --> 00:31:26.826
triggers. Here we have

1454
00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:28.526
ADW trigger cron notion

1455
00:31:28.526 --> 00:31:29.785
tasks. So another cron

1456
00:31:29.785 --> 00:31:31.144
job that is going
