2169
00:46:59.402 --> 00:47:00.503
any format. It's not

2170
00:47:00.503 --> 00:47:01.382
about the software developer

2171
00:47:01.382 --> 00:47:02.322
lifecycle at all. It's

2172
00:47:02.322 --> 00:47:04.702
about the composable pieces

2173
00:47:04.961 --> 00:47:06.021
of Agentic Coding that

2174
00:47:06.021 --> 00:47:06.760
you can now put

2175
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.340
together to deliver more

2176
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.077
results in the agentic

2177
00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:10.918
layer of your code

2178
00:47:10.918 --> 00:47:11.536
base so that your

2179
00:47:11.717 --> 00:47:13.135
agents can operate on

2180
00:47:13.135 --> 00:47:14.195
your codebase. That's

2181
00:47:14.195 --> 00:47:14.994
why we always add

2182
00:47:14.994 --> 00:47:16.014
feedback loops. The big

2183
00:47:16.014 --> 00:47:17.413
labs, the big three,

2184
00:47:17.413 --> 00:47:18.791
Gen AI companies, they're

2185
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:20.271
all doing this right

2186
00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:20.971
now, right? They have

2187
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.748
these insane feedback loops

2188
00:47:22.748 --> 00:47:24.327
where agents are operating,

2189
00:47:24.327 --> 00:47:26.347
solving problems, iterating on

2190
00:47:26.347 --> 00:47:28.005
research over and over

2191
00:47:28.005 --> 00:47:28.744
and over and over

2192
00:47:28.744 --> 00:47:30.563
against some validation function.
