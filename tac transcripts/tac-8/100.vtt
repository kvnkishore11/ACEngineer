2307
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.201
you have all the

2308
00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:01.659
pieces to build, whatever

2309
00:50:01.659 --> 00:50:02.380
you need to now,

2310
00:50:02.539 --> 00:50:03.838
you'll run this and

2311
00:50:03.838 --> 00:50:04.958
that will be more

2312
00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:05.918
than enough. Not only

2313
00:50:05.918 --> 00:50:06.536
will you stay out

2314
00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.777
the loop, getting in

2315
00:50:07.777 --> 00:50:08.596
the loop will be

2316
00:50:08.596 --> 00:50:10.275
harmful. So you'll drop

2317
00:50:10.275 --> 00:50:11.635
the review process and

2318
00:50:11.635 --> 00:50:12.634
you'll ship end to

2319
00:50:12.634 --> 00:50:13.494
end. You will let

2320
00:50:13.494 --> 00:50:15.731
your product ship itself.

2321
00:50:15.731 --> 00:50:17.530
Target zero touch engineering.

2322
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:18.791
And finally, putting it

2323
00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:21.188
all together, we prioritize

2324
00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:22.967
agentics. If it isn't

2325
00:50:22.967 --> 00:50:25.166
clear, this is the

2326
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:26.684
place, the area of

2327
00:50:26.684 --> 00:50:28.304
focus of the largest

2328
00:50:28.304 --> 00:50:29.922
return on investment. Let's

2329
00:50:29.922 --> 00:50:31.782
be super clear. What
