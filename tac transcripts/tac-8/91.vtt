start increasing your agentic

2099
00:45:30.992 --> 00:45:32.751
coding KPIs right? What

2100
00:45:32.751 --> 00:45:33.791
are those? They're the

2101
00:45:33.791 --> 00:45:35.130
measure of your success

2102
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.090
as an Agentic Engineer

2103
00:45:37.289 --> 00:45:38.250
Okay, you want to

2104
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.568
decrease the attempts it

2105
00:45:39.588 --> 00:45:40.088
takes for you to

2106
00:45:40.088 --> 00:45:41.168
deliver work with your

2107
00:45:41.168 --> 00:45:42.007
agents you want to

2108
00:45:42.007 --> 00:45:43.347
increase the size of

2109
00:45:43.347 --> 00:45:44.186
work you can hand

2110
00:45:44.186 --> 00:45:45.065
off to your agents

2111
00:45:45.106 --> 00:45:46.326
you want to increase

2112
00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:48.286
the streak of successful

2113
00:45:48.286 --> 00:45:49.184
work you're shipping with

2114
00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:50.264
your agents without making

2115
00:45:50.264 --> 00:45:51.545
mistakes. And then you

2116
00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:52.744
wanna drop your presence

2117
00:45:52.744 --> 00:45:53.565
to the bare minimum.

2118
00:45:53.565 --> 00:45:55.063
Presence is you showing

2119
00:45:55.063 --> 00:45:56.043
up and writing a

2120
00:45:56.043 --> 00:45:57.483
prompt and reviewing and

2121
00:45:57.503 --> 00:45:58.623
doing work with your

2122
00:45:58.623 --> 00:45:59.583
agent. You wanna drop

2123
00:45:59.583 --> 00:46:00.184
this to zero. You
