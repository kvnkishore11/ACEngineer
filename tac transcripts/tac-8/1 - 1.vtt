12
00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:30.277
this lesson, we cement

13
00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.856
critical Agentic Coding ideas,

14
00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.335
tactics, and beliefs by

15
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.375
revisiting the atoms that

16
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.075
make up everything we'll

17
00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:40.414
do as Agentic Engineers

18
00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:42.692
moving forward. We understand

19
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.110
that these tactics, they're

20
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.189
not bound to the

21
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:47.427
software developer lifecycle or

22
00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:49.706
any specific engineering workflow.

23
00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:51.244
They're here to serve

24
00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:53.124
your engineering. They're building

25
00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:54.063
blocks for you to

26
00:00:54.063 --> 00:00:56.121
use to compose repeatable

27
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.060
solutions for your agents.

28
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.219
When I say build

29
00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.753
the system, that builds
