765
00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:30.003
You can make a

766
00:17:30.003 --> 00:17:31.942
chainable ADW, right? A

767
00:17:31.942 --> 00:17:33.022
one, two, it just

768
00:17:33.022 --> 00:17:34.602
calls one prompt and

769
00:17:34.602 --> 00:17:35.162
then it passes the

770
00:17:35.182 --> 00:17:36.001
other end. You can

771
00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:36.801
make all types of

772
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:38.481
configurations, okay? I prefer

773
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:40.780
this nice explicit version.

774
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.181
It's a lot more

775
00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:43.200
readable, understandable for yourself,

776
00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:44.019
for your engineers on

777
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:44.720
your team, and of

778
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.380
course, most importantly, for

779
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.279
agents that you work

780
00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:48.659
with. This is the

781
00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:49.939
foundational layer, okay? And

782
00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:50.659
we can of course

783
00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:51.738
run this, right? So

784
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:52.597
let's just go ahead,

785
00:17:52.617 --> 00:17:54.077
plan, build something simple.

786
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.729
of main in app

787
00:17:55.729 --> 00:17:57.528
slash star, okay? And

788
00:17:57.528 --> 00:17:59.587
so this will unnecessarily

789
00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:01.346
plan and build. We
