348
00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:30.892
can run slash prime.

349
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:31.971
This gets your agent

350
00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:33.591
up and running, understanding

351
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:34.770
your codebase very

352
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.870
quickly. And now it's

353
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.129
important that this is

354
00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:38.988
a standalone file. There's

355
00:08:38.988 --> 00:08:39.888
going to be different

356
00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:41.126
types of priming. You

357
00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:42.586
can prime different sections

358
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:43.285
of your codebase.

359
00:08:43.285 --> 00:08:43.845
You can have prime

360
00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:45.423
commands for all types

361
00:08:45.423 --> 00:08:46.264
of things. This is

362
00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:47.663
a simple application. So

363
00:08:47.663 --> 00:08:48.822
we have a simple

364
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.961
prime command. Okay. And

365
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:51.860
you can see here,

366
00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:52.679
we have a great

367
00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:55.217
breakdown of this application

368
00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:57.336
throughout tactical Agentic Coding.

369
00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.496
We've been storing our

370
00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.515
logs in the agents

371
00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:01.076
directory and a log
