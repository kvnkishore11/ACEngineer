170
00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:31.233
I recommend more than

171
00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.252
half of your time

172
00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.012
should be focused on

173
00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.331
the agentic layer. As

174
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.730
we work through these

175
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.413
final codebases, Keep

176
00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:38.454
your eyes on the

177
00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:39.973
primitives. Keep your eyes

178
00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:41.533
on the composable units

179
00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:42.771
of Agentic Coding that

180
00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:44.112
make up the work

181
00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:44.672
that you're going to

182
00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:45.591
see. Focus on the

183
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:46.630
pieces that make the

184
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.130
whole, from the individual

185
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:49.891
agentic prompts up to

186
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:52.410
the composed multi-step AI

187
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.848
developer workflows. This is

188
00:04:53.848 --> 00:04:54.928
what matters. Not the

189
00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.827
software developer lifecycle, not

190
00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:57.687
a model, not a

191
00:04:57.687 --> 00:04:58.927
tool, not Claude Code.

192
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:01.105
It's the primitives, right?
