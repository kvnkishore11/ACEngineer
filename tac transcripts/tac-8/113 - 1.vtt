2593
00:56:29.516 --> 00:56:30.775
stop, bar none. What

2594
00:56:30.775 --> 00:56:31.916
you've done here in

2595
00:56:31.916 --> 00:56:33.135
tactical Agentic is

2596
00:56:33.135 --> 00:56:34.074
much deeper than you

2597
00:56:34.074 --> 00:56:35.233
might realize, what you

2598
00:56:35.233 --> 00:56:36.514
can now do is

2599
00:56:36.514 --> 00:56:37.233
much deeper than you

2600
00:56:37.233 --> 00:56:39.092
might realize. We've described

2601
00:56:39.112 --> 00:56:41.650
the commoditization of implementation.

2602
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:42.590
AI coding is not

2603
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:43.869
enough. Coding has been

2604
00:56:43.869 --> 00:56:44.929
commoditized, but what we're

2605
00:56:44.929 --> 00:56:46.509
seeing here, looking through

2606
00:56:46.509 --> 00:56:48.108
these examples, working through

2607
00:56:48.327 --> 00:56:50.068
agentic layers, right, scaling

2608
00:56:50.068 --> 00:56:51.186
up across the software

2609
00:56:51.186 --> 00:56:52.646
developer lifecycle, what you've

2610
00:56:52.646 --> 00:56:53.646
seen here is the

2611
00:56:53.646 --> 00:56:56.005
commoditization of implementation and

2612
00:56:56.005 --> 00:56:57.324
early signs of the

2613
00:56:57.324 --> 00:57:00.123
commoditization of engineering, okay?
