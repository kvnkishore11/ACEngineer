2017
00:43:29.442 --> 00:43:30.621
coding, you now have

2018
00:43:30.722 --> 00:43:31.661
everything you need to

2019
00:43:31.661 --> 00:43:33.581
become an irreplaceable engineer.

2020
00:43:33.641 --> 00:43:34.860
It starts when you

2021
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.480
stop coding. I can

2022
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.338
guarantee you the irreplaceable

2023
00:43:38.338 --> 00:43:39.719
engineer of the future

2024
00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:40.958
is not writing a

2025
00:43:40.958 --> 00:43:42.418
single line of code.

2026
00:43:42.597 --> 00:43:43.936
That's tactic number one.

2027
00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:44.697
Let's just walk through

2028
00:43:44.697 --> 00:43:45.876
these and understand what

2029
00:43:45.876 --> 00:43:46.795
we now know to

2030
00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:47.835
be true about agentic

2031
00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:48.916
coding, okay? When you

2032
00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:50.875
adopt your agent's perspective,

2033
00:43:51.114 --> 00:43:52.893
you can build powerful

2034
00:43:52.893 --> 00:43:55.172
agents that improve your

2035
00:43:55.172 --> 00:43:57.472
Agentic Coding KPIs. You

2036
00:43:57.472 --> 00:43:58.851
give them the tools

2037
00:43:58.851 --> 00:43:59.891
that they need in

2038
00:43:59.891 --> 00:44:01.451
their context model prompt
