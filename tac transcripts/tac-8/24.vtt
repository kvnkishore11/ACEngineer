511
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:00.754
using them right in

512
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:01.633
the loop, you want

513
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:02.892
to quickly start moving

514
00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:04.150
out the loop and

515
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.649
you want to quickly

516
00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:05.808
start scaling up and

517
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.785
chaining together useful pieces

518
00:12:08.865 --> 00:12:10.504
of Agentic Coding. The

519
00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:10.984
best way to do

520
00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:11.702
this is to get

521
00:12:11.722 --> 00:12:13.182
outside the agent, get

522
00:12:13.302 --> 00:12:15.301
outside the prompt interface,

523
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:16.600
right? Whatever application you're

524
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.379
using, you're gonna be

525
00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:18.078
watching this in the

526
00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:19.437
future. Claude code will

527
00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:20.297
very likely still be

528
00:12:20.297 --> 00:12:21.216
around, still be very

529
00:12:21.216 --> 00:12:22.515
powerful and useful. But

530
00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:23.434
the whole point is

531
00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.813
that you're detached from

532
00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:26.777
any tool. It's just

533
00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:28.836
about Agentic Coding. It's

534
00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:30.096
about tactics that you
