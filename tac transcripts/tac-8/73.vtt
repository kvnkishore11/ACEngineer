1697
00:36:29.244 --> 00:36:30.722
in the timeline of

1698
00:36:30.722 --> 00:36:32.282
generative AI. This is

1699
00:36:32.282 --> 00:36:33.920
just where everything is

1700
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.539
going and you want

1701
00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:36.159
to lean forward. So

1702
00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:36.998
check this out. We

1703
00:36:36.998 --> 00:36:39.336
have phase two implementation

1704
00:36:39.336 --> 00:36:40.556
successful. This is our

1705
00:36:40.556 --> 00:36:43.014
MCP system info server.

1706
00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:43.793
And so let's just

1707
00:36:43.793 --> 00:36:44.233
go and check it

1708
00:36:44.233 --> 00:36:45.753
out. Feature MCP system

1709
00:36:45.753 --> 00:36:46.472
info. So this is

1710
00:36:46.472 --> 00:36:47.492
an MCP server that

1711
00:36:47.492 --> 00:36:49.291
gives us system information,

1712
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:51.242
accessible to our agent.

1713
00:36:51.302 --> 00:36:52.481
Okay. Let's do code

1714
00:36:52.641 --> 00:36:55.278
trees, feet, MCP. And

1715
00:36:55.298 --> 00:36:56.137
I'm just going to

1716
00:36:56.137 --> 00:36:56.737
go all the way

1717
00:36:56.737 --> 00:36:58.317
into this here. So

1718
00:36:58.376 --> 00:36:59.175
this is the environment

1719
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.755
that that agent completed
