2411
00:52:29.525 --> 00:52:31.224
everything else. This is

2412
00:52:31.224 --> 00:52:31.983
the only question you

2413
00:52:31.983 --> 00:52:33.643
need to win that

2414
00:52:33.643 --> 00:52:34.543
can guide you. Okay,

2415
00:52:34.543 --> 00:52:35.882
so right now on

2416
00:52:35.882 --> 00:52:37.282
a day-to-day basis when

2417
00:52:37.282 --> 00:52:39.885
you're working, ask yourself

2418
00:52:39.905 --> 00:52:40.565
this, am I working

2419
00:52:40.565 --> 00:52:41.983
on the agentic layer

2420
00:52:42.003 --> 00:52:42.963
or am I working

2421
00:52:43.123 --> 00:52:44.382
in the application layer?

2422
00:52:44.443 --> 00:52:45.342
That's it, okay? On

2423
00:52:45.342 --> 00:52:46.802
a day-to-day tactical level,

2424
00:52:46.822 --> 00:52:47.721
even if you forget

2425
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:49.061
all eight tactics, this

2426
00:52:49.061 --> 00:52:49.800
is all you need

2427
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.739
to think about. Am

2428
00:52:50.739 --> 00:52:51.780
I working on the

2429
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.059
agentic layer or am

2430
00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:53.998
I working on the

2431
00:52:53.998 --> 00:52:56.137
application layer? The majority

2432
00:52:56.137 --> 00:52:56.998
of your time should

2433
00:52:56.998 --> 00:52:58.237
be spent, of course,

2434
00:52:58.257 --> 00:52:59.277
on the agentic layer.

2435
00:52:59.277 --> 00:53:00.137
Why is that? It's
