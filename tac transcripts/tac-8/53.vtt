00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:30.116
Remember prioritize Agentics. Prioritize

1211
00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:31.195
the agentic layer of

1212
00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:32.134
your codebase. Don't

1213
00:26:32.134 --> 00:26:32.954
do the work by

1214
00:26:32.954 --> 00:26:34.513
yourself. Teach your agents

1215
00:26:34.513 --> 00:26:35.272
to do it. Teach

1216
00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:35.972
them how to solve

1217
00:26:35.972 --> 00:26:37.551
the problem class. Build

1218
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:39.029
the system that builds

1219
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:40.289
the system. We're operating

1220
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:41.568
on that new agentic

1221
00:26:41.568 --> 00:26:43.547
layer. Prompts composed into

1222
00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:45.781
AI developer workflows. Okay,

1223
00:26:45.942 --> 00:26:46.402
but you can see

1224
00:26:46.402 --> 00:26:46.820
here, you know, we're

1225
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.681
just passing that task

1226
00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:48.641
description and then just

1227
00:26:48.641 --> 00:26:49.519
gonna start do a

1228
00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:51.259
couple simple things, research,

1229
00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:52.939
implement, test, commit. This

1230
00:26:52.939 --> 00:26:53.377
is more of like

1231
00:26:53.397 --> 00:26:54.758
a quick patch. And

1232
00:26:54.758 --> 00:26:55.497
then we have more

1233
00:26:55.497 --> 00:26:57.217
sophisticated tooling. We have

1234
00:26:57.217 --> 00:26:58.615
a plan implement workflow,

1235
00:26:58.615 --> 00:27:00.434
right? An architect and
