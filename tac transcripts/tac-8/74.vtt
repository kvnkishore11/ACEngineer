1719
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.755
that that agent completed

1720
00:37:00.755 --> 00:37:01.994
its work in. And

1721
00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:02.514
you know, you can

1722
00:37:02.514 --> 00:37:03.094
see here that it

1723
00:37:03.134 --> 00:37:03.713
moved to done. It

1724
00:37:03.713 --> 00:37:04.632
looks like another task

1725
00:37:04.632 --> 00:37:05.612
got completed as well,

1726
00:37:05.612 --> 00:37:06.670
but this is finished.

1727
00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:07.311
And if we click

1728
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:08.769
this, you can see,

1729
00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:10.440
Live updates, right? There's

1730
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.481
its summary. And of

1731
00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:12.340
course, this is a

1732
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.019
presentational example. I've just

1733
00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:14.978
kind of breezed through

1734
00:37:14.978 --> 00:37:15.739
what this could look

1735
00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:16.478
like, but you can

1736
00:37:16.478 --> 00:37:17.597
put anything you want

1737
00:37:17.597 --> 00:37:18.398
here. You wanna be

1738
00:37:18.398 --> 00:37:19.896
observing and monitoring your

1739
00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:21.615
agentic system very well

1740
00:37:21.635 --> 00:37:22.994
in your Outloop review

1741
00:37:22.994 --> 00:37:24.893
system. Again, just examples,

1742
00:37:24.893 --> 00:37:25.773
just working through this

1743
00:37:25.773 --> 00:37:26.474
with you so you

1744
00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:28.052
can understand, right? Everything

1745
00:37:28.052 --> 00:37:28.952
I'm doing here is

1746
00:37:28.952 --> 00:37:29.512
built to help you

1747
00:37:29.552 --> 00:37:30.851
understand what you can
