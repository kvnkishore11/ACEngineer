2524
00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:00.530
users, team, company, you.

2525
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.349
This all relies on

2526
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:03.068
you being able to

2527
00:55:03.068 --> 00:55:05.088
invest in your agentic

2528
00:55:05.307 --> 00:55:06.226
layer. Do not make

2529
00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:07.206
the mistake of thinking

2530
00:55:07.206 --> 00:55:08.525
you're smarter than your

2531
00:55:08.525 --> 00:55:10.885
best engineering practices and

2532
00:55:10.885 --> 00:55:12.925
your best team's practices

2533
00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:14.784
templated into your agentic

2534
00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:16.603
layer. Okay, don't make

2535
00:55:16.603 --> 00:55:18.161
that mistake. Okay, because

2536
00:55:18.161 --> 00:55:18.762
if you're not wrong

2537
00:55:18.762 --> 00:55:20.153
today, you will be

2538
00:55:20.153 --> 00:55:21.072
wrong at some point.

2539
00:55:21.092 --> 00:55:22.492
These are massive mistakes

2540
00:55:22.492 --> 00:55:23.413
that will prevent you

2541
00:55:23.413 --> 00:55:24.871
from becoming an agentic

2542
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:26.192
engineer. What is an

2543
00:55:26.192 --> 00:55:27.931
Agentic Engineer? It's the

2544
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:30.471
irreplaceable engineer that builds
