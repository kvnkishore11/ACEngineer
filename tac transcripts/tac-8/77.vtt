1797
00:38:29.324 --> 00:38:30.244
so much of the

1798
00:38:30.244 --> 00:38:31.784
work you're doing, getting

1799
00:38:31.784 --> 00:38:32.663
really full on space

1800
00:38:32.663 --> 00:38:34.021
there, but we created

1801
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:36.360
an entire MCP server

1802
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.260
with a single prompt.

1803
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.278
Let's look at that

1804
00:38:38.278 --> 00:38:39.958
exact prompt, right? Look

1805
00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:40.898
at how concise this

1806
00:38:40.898 --> 00:38:42.496
is, right? Create a

1807
00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:43.875
concise and minimal model-concept

1808
00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:45.634
protocol server that provides

1809
00:38:45.634 --> 00:38:47.012
system information, blah, blah,

1810
00:38:47.012 --> 00:38:47.393
blah, blah, blah, okay?

1811
00:38:47.452 --> 00:38:48.972
That's it, execute, okay?

1812
00:38:49.092 --> 00:38:50.371
I have solved the

1813
00:38:50.371 --> 00:38:52.760
problem class of building

1814
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.976
Astral UV model context

1815
00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:56.793
protocol servers. Okay? I've

1816
00:38:56.793 --> 00:38:58.130
solved it. It's done.

1817
00:38:58.389 --> 00:38:59.050
Okay, this is the

1818
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.409
power of the agentic
