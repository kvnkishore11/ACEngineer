2076
00:44:57.987 --> 00:45:00.746
specific rules, guidelines, files

2077
00:45:00.746 --> 00:45:03.346
to read, conditional documentation,

2078
00:45:03.346 --> 00:45:03.945
so on and so

2079
00:45:03.945 --> 00:45:05.264
forth, right? You saw

2080
00:45:05.264 --> 00:45:07.083
this throughout tactical agentic

2081
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:08.224
coding. You saw all

2082
00:45:08.224 --> 00:45:09.663
of this. This scales

2083
00:45:09.663 --> 00:45:11.101
to any codebase.

2084
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:12.101
Don't make the mistake

2085
00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:13.181
of thinking that the

2086
00:45:13.181 --> 00:45:14.460
simple toy examples we

2087
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.840
worked on here are

2088
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.179
a bottleneck in any

2089
00:45:17.179 --> 00:45:18.259
way. They're not. Don't

2090
00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:19.378
use anything as an

2091
00:45:19.378 --> 00:45:20.197
excuse to slow you

2092
00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:22.056
down here. I purposefully

2093
00:45:22.097 --> 00:45:23.815
hyper-focus on the agentic

2094
00:45:23.815 --> 00:45:24.655
layer throughout this course.

2095
00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.614
Okay, now what happens

2096
00:45:26.614 --> 00:45:27.735
next right once you

2097
00:45:27.735 --> 00:45:29.153
template your engineering you

2098
00:45:29.153 --> 00:45:30.992
start increasing your agentic
