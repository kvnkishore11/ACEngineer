of important auxiliary directory,

1596
00:34:31.447 --> 00:34:32.766
just paste in whatever

1597
00:34:32.766 --> 00:34:34.045
documentation you need. But

1598
00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:35.306
here we have a

1599
00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:36.545
prompt right, a meta

1600
00:34:36.545 --> 00:34:38.204
prompt that builds out

1601
00:34:38.224 --> 00:34:40.443
astral uv python model

1602
00:34:40.443 --> 00:34:42.900
context protocol servers. All

1603
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.559
it needs is a

1604
00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:44.659
prompt and then it

1605
00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.838
builds out an mcp

1606
00:34:45.838 --> 00:34:47.117
server, right, based off

1607
00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:48.635
the documentation and our

1608
00:34:48.635 --> 00:34:49.914
request, okay. And you

1609
00:34:49.914 --> 00:34:50.675
can see here very

1610
00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:52.498
clearly right, template meta

1611
00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:54.237
prompt, same structure, nothing

1612
00:34:54.237 --> 00:34:55.036
new happening there. You

1613
00:34:55.036 --> 00:34:56.036
already know about this,

1614
00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:56.556
you already know about

1615
00:34:56.556 --> 00:34:58.094
writing great prompts. You

1616
00:34:58.094 --> 00:34:59.014
know, you can scale

1617
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.454
this to whatever type
