00:31:58.871 --> 00:32:00.010
prompt, you just look

1484
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.930
for slash, right? And

1485
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.009
there it is. Update

1486
00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:04.548
Notion task, make work

1487
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:05.548
tree name, init work

1488
00:32:05.548 --> 00:32:07.467
tree, get notion tasks,

1489
00:32:07.487 --> 00:32:07.926
so on and so

1490
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.806
forth. And then we

1491
00:32:08.806 --> 00:32:11.045
have composed AI developer

1492
00:32:11.045 --> 00:32:12.743
workflows that actually do

1493
00:32:12.884 --> 00:32:13.983
some work for us.

1494
00:32:14.083 --> 00:32:16.041
Okay. There's plan update,

1495
00:32:16.122 --> 00:32:16.582
so on and so

1496
00:32:16.582 --> 00:32:17.261
forth. You can see

1497
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:19.101
here our cron, right?

1498
00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:20.240
Our trigger in the

1499
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.739
Peter framework, our trigger

1500
00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:22.459
is starting to pick

1501
00:32:22.459 --> 00:32:24.369
up tasks and check

1502
00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:25.088
that out, right? It

1503
00:32:25.288 --> 00:32:26.387
agentically picked up and

1504
00:32:26.387 --> 00:32:27.366
moved that task for

1505
00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.386
us. And our agent

1506
00:32:28.386 --> 00:32:29.046
is now going to

1507
00:32:29.046 --> 00:32:29.865
start working. If we

1508
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:30.744
open this up, you
