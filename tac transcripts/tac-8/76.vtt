1774
00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:01.045
now claude get there

1775
00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:01.706
we go get memory

1776
00:38:01.706 --> 00:38:03.938
info mcp Get memory

1777
00:38:03.938 --> 00:38:04.757
info. So I'm just

1778
00:38:04.757 --> 00:38:05.755
running a random MCP

1779
00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:07.913
tool that created by

1780
00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:08.831
our agents and check

1781
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:09.971
this out, right? That's

1782
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.748
working perfectly. There's my

1783
00:38:11.849 --> 00:38:13.766
memory usage, 128, use

1784
00:38:13.786 --> 00:38:15.985
32, available 93. Fantastic.

1785
00:38:15.985 --> 00:38:17.402
Okay, so not to

1786
00:38:17.402 --> 00:38:17.983
get too much in

1787
00:38:17.983 --> 00:38:18.960
the weeds of this

1788
00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:20.480
exact tool, but we

1789
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.237
can just do this.

1790
00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:22.889
and we can do

1791
00:38:22.889 --> 00:38:23.869
this as well, right?

1792
00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:25.168
Get CPU, get disk.

1793
00:38:25.327 --> 00:38:26.407
Our agent created this

1794
00:38:26.407 --> 00:38:27.367
for us end to

1795
00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.666
end, okay? You don't

1796
00:38:28.666 --> 00:38:29.324
need to be doing

1797
00:38:29.324 --> 00:38:30.244
so much of the
