2862
01:02:29.364 --> 01:02:30.963
slop, thank you for

2863
01:02:30.963 --> 01:02:32.262
trusting me with your

2864
01:02:32.262 --> 01:02:33.782
time, with your engineering,

2865
01:02:33.782 --> 01:02:35.061
with your future, with

2866
01:02:35.061 --> 01:02:36.300
your career. I could

2867
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.360
not have created this

2868
01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.599
course. I could not

2869
01:02:38.599 --> 01:02:39.498
have created any of

2870
01:02:39.498 --> 01:02:41.797
these ideas. without executing

2871
01:02:41.797 --> 01:02:43.257
on them over and

2872
01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:44.356
over and over and

2873
01:02:44.356 --> 01:02:45.817
over, over years. So

2874
01:02:45.817 --> 01:02:46.235
at the end of

2875
01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:46.996
this course here, I

2876
01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:47.695
want you to trust

2877
01:02:47.695 --> 01:02:49.016
me one more time

2878
01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:51.114
and put this information

2879
01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:52.715
to use to change

2880
01:02:52.934 --> 01:02:54.914
your engineering forever. If

2881
01:02:54.914 --> 01:02:55.994
you do this right,

2882
01:02:56.054 --> 01:02:57.913
it will change everything.

2883
01:02:58.072 --> 01:03:00.791
Prioritize agentics. When the
