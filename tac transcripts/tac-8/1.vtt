00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.926
prompt that triggers a

14
00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.665
fleet of agents that

15
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.825
ship your work end

16
00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:34.784
to end. We're not

17
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:35.963
just talking about any

18
00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:37.003
agents though. We're using

19
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.743
Claude Code agents that

20
00:00:38.743 --> 00:00:40.542
run your AI developer

21
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.261
workflows to ship with

22
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.801
your expertise in your

23
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:45.460
product to solve your

24
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.658
domain specific problems. With

25
00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:49.018
just the three steps

26
00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:50.259
we've covered, you will

27
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.777
outperform any cloud-based agentic

28
00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:53.857
coding tool, but we're

29
00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:55.216
not done yet. After

30
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:56.417
you complete this lesson,

31
00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:57.637
not only will you

32
00:00:57.637 --> 00:00:58.356
know how to plan,

33
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.636
build, and test autonomously,
