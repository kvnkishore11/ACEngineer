987
00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:00.073
start creating these work

988
00:22:00.073 --> 00:22:01.272
trees. Okay. So these

989
00:22:01.272 --> 00:22:02.951
are dedicated environments for

990
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:03.891
agents to work in,

991
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.430
right? We're scaling up.

992
00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:06.190
This is an example

993
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.169
of a thin agent

994
00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:08.988
layer scaled up just

995
00:22:08.988 --> 00:22:10.446
a little further. Okay.

996
00:22:10.606 --> 00:22:11.365
We have this simple

997
00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:12.825
multi-agent system where we

998
00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:14.523
can delegate work. And

999
00:22:14.523 --> 00:22:15.483
there's something really special

1000
00:22:15.483 --> 00:22:16.202
about this, right? This

1001
00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:17.303
is a powerful system

1002
00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:19.201
for work, like data

1003
00:22:19.201 --> 00:22:20.681
science for data engineering

1004
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:22.859
work, because oftentimes when

1005
00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:23.559
you're building out these

1006
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:24.659
classifiers, when you're building

1007
00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:26.318
up models, you're running

1008
00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:29.117
multiple versions, multiple experiments,

1009
00:22:29.178 --> 00:22:30.196
right? And so this
