00:57:29.108 --> 00:57:31.027
expertise for your agents,

2638
00:57:31.108 --> 00:57:32.086
for your product, for

2639
00:57:32.086 --> 00:57:33.067
your team, for your

2640
00:57:33.067 --> 00:57:35.429
company, quality control, right?

2641
00:57:35.469 --> 00:57:37.509
Validation review systems, and

2642
00:57:37.509 --> 00:57:38.987
most importantly, creative problem

2643
00:57:38.987 --> 00:57:41.206
decomposition, right? Which you'll

2644
00:57:41.206 --> 00:57:42.686
then encode in your

2645
00:57:42.686 --> 00:57:44.146
ADWs. This is bigger

2646
00:57:44.146 --> 00:57:45.244
than a course. This

2647
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:46.744
is a manifesto for

2648
00:57:46.744 --> 00:57:48.463
the next phase of

2649
00:57:48.463 --> 00:57:49.983
software engineering. This is

2650
00:57:49.983 --> 00:57:50.981
the guideline. This is

2651
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:52.420
the framework. This is

2652
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.320
the codex for agentic

2653
00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.420
engineering. This is the

2654
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.018
groundwork for a new

2655
00:57:57.018 --> 00:57:58.577
role of engineering, the

2656
00:57:58.577 --> 00:58:01.760
Agentic Engineers, Agentic Engineering.
