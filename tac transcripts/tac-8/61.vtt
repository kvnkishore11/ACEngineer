1404
00:30:29.571 --> 00:30:30.790
board view, okay? So

1405
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.230
this is just a

1406
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.269
classic board view and

1407
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:34.128
you can see here,

1408
00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:36.127
we have multiple simple

1409
00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:38.806
examples of prompts right,

1410
00:30:38.806 --> 00:30:39.586
coming right out of

1411
00:30:39.586 --> 00:30:41.345
a Notion database. There

1412
00:30:41.345 --> 00:30:42.724
are of course many

1413
00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:43.365
ways you can tweak

1414
00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:43.964
this and use this

1415
00:30:43.964 --> 00:30:44.763
and improve it. We

1416
00:30:44.763 --> 00:30:45.423
should have a lot

1417
00:30:45.423 --> 00:30:47.263
of our tags as

1418
00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:49.303
properties, but that all

1419
00:30:49.303 --> 00:30:50.262
doesn't matter. That's all

1420
00:30:50.262 --> 00:30:50.903
based on how you

1421
00:30:50.903 --> 00:30:51.842
wanna set up your

1422
00:30:51.842 --> 00:30:53.261
agents and your Outloop

1423
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:54.921
agentic systems. Remember the

1424
00:30:54.921 --> 00:30:56.121
Peter framework. You have

1425
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:57.520
prompt input. For us,

1426
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.579
it's this Notion page.

1427
00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.680
Environment, this is going

1428
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.000
to operate inside the
