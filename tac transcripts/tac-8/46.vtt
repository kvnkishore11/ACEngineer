1036
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:00.410
way, right? This is

1037
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.028
all our ADWs and

1038
00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:03.627
our agents starting to

1039
00:23:03.627 --> 00:23:04.886
pick up work and

1040
00:23:04.886 --> 00:23:06.026
get to work. So

1041
00:23:06.026 --> 00:23:07.444
we're scaling outside of

1042
00:23:07.444 --> 00:23:08.605
the traditional UI, right?

1043
00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:10.443
We're pushing past the

1044
00:23:10.443 --> 00:23:12.583
overkilled chat-based UI, right?

1045
00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:14.002
We have a two-way

1046
00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:15.402
task list and you

1047
00:23:15.402 --> 00:23:16.681
can see this yellow

1048
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:17.840
kind of sun emoji

1049
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.980
here and a git

1050
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.819
commit hash. This uniquely

1051
00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:22.798
marks this agent executing

1052
00:23:22.898 --> 00:23:24.057
on work, okay? You

1053
00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:24.917
can imagine as I

1054
00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:25.856
work here, you know,

1055
00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:26.537
throughout my day, I

1056
00:23:26.537 --> 00:23:28.836
review this work tree

1057
00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:30.115
and as results come
