WEBVTT

2146
00:46:28.565 --> 00:46:30.409
We add tests. Okay,

2147
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:31.929
these are validation commands

2148
00:46:31.929 --> 00:46:33.329
that your agent runs

2149
00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:34.688
to confirm that their

2150
00:46:34.688 --> 00:46:36.646
work was successful. Okay,

2151
00:46:36.786 --> 00:46:37.746
in the software developer

2152
00:46:37.746 --> 00:46:39.826
lifecycle, we embedded lots

2153
00:46:39.826 --> 00:46:40.626
of testing, lots of

2154
00:46:40.626 --> 00:46:41.925
reviewing, lots of validation

2155
00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:42.985
in the test and

2156
00:46:42.985 --> 00:46:44.443
review step. The software

2157
00:46:44.443 --> 00:46:45.483
developer lifecycle is a

2158
00:46:45.483 --> 00:46:48.161
fantastic way to understand

2159
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:49.181
what you can do

2160
00:46:49.346 --> 00:46:50.565
with Agentix, what it

2161
00:46:50.565 --> 00:46:51.764
looks like to automate

2162
00:46:51.764 --> 00:46:52.505
end to end. It's

2163
00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:54.085
a great starting example,

2164
00:46:54.085 --> 00:46:54.824
but it's not going

2165
00:46:54.824 --> 00:46:56.043
to be exactly what

2166
00:46:56.043 --> 00:46:56.943
you need. You can

2167
00:46:56.943 --> 00:46:58.264
build up any workflow

2168
00:46:58.264 --> 00:46:59.302
that you need in

2169
00:46:59.402 --> 00:47:00.503
any format. It's not
