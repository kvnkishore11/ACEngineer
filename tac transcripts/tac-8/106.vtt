00:52:59.277 --> 00:53:00.137
Why is that? It's

2436
00:53:00.157 --> 00:53:01.916
because you can teach

2437
00:53:01.996 --> 00:53:03.257
compute how to build.

2438
00:53:03.336 --> 00:53:04.597
It's because you can

2439
00:53:04.597 --> 00:53:05.715
teach compute how to

2440
00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:07.675
engineer your way. It's

2441
00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:09.476
because you can scale

2442
00:53:09.476 --> 00:53:12.315
your compute beyond comprehension

2443
00:53:12.414 --> 00:53:13.514
inside of the new

2444
00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:14.835
agentic layer of your

2445
00:53:14.835 --> 00:53:16.235
codebase where you're

2446
00:53:16.275 --> 00:53:19.034
orchestrating intelligence. That's why.

2447
00:53:19.134 --> 00:53:19.733
This is why we

2448
00:53:19.733 --> 00:53:21.293
do it. Just like

2449
00:53:21.474 --> 00:53:22.893
an engineer using AI

2450
00:53:23.052 --> 00:53:24.512
will outperform an engineer

2451
00:53:24.552 --> 00:53:25.851
not using AI, an

2452
00:53:25.851 --> 00:53:27.612
engineer that is scaling

2453
00:53:27.612 --> 00:53:28.572
up their codebase

2454
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:30.411
with fleets of agents
