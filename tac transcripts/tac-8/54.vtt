1235
00:26:58.615 --> 00:27:00.434
right? An architect and

1236
00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:01.535
an editor, ultra powerful

1237
00:27:01.535 --> 00:27:02.753
pattern, especially when you

1238
00:27:02.753 --> 00:27:04.506
combine it. with template

1239
00:27:04.506 --> 00:27:05.325
meta prompts, which of

1240
00:27:05.325 --> 00:27:06.565
course we have here,

1241
00:27:06.704 --> 00:27:07.683
right? We have our

1242
00:27:07.884 --> 00:27:08.883
plan prompt. This is

1243
00:27:08.883 --> 00:27:10.863
a generic plan. It's

1244
00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:11.481
not, you know, a

1245
00:27:11.481 --> 00:27:12.882
chore or feature. It's

1246
00:27:12.882 --> 00:27:14.080
just a plan, right?

1247
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.300
Just super general, super

1248
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.279
vague. You will be

1249
00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:17.398
able to outperform these

1250
00:27:17.398 --> 00:27:18.538
by going more specific,

1251
00:27:18.618 --> 00:27:19.958
but the simple plan

1252
00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:20.917
prompt is a great

1253
00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:21.836
place to start. So

1254
00:27:21.836 --> 00:27:22.997
same deal there, template

1255
00:27:22.997 --> 00:27:24.355
meta prompt, very important.

1256
00:27:24.355 --> 00:27:24.935
This is a key

1257
00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:26.954
leverage point of agentic

1258
00:27:26.974 --> 00:27:28.174
coding. You already know

1259
00:27:28.174 --> 00:27:28.733
that. We don't need

1260
00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:29.673
to revisit that. You

1261
00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:30.893
can see here, we
