47
00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:31.055
course in its essence

48
00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:32.736
represents an opportunity for

49
00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:33.555
you to pull the

50
00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:35.135
future into the present.

51
00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:36.694
There's engineering work you're

52
00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:37.893
spending time on that

53
00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:39.093
you don't need to

54
00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:40.371
be. As time goes

55
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.932
on, as tools improve,

56
00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:43.671
as models continue to

57
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:44.829
progress, you'll be able

58
00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.129
to hand off more

59
00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.929
and more work to

60
00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.909
your agentic layer. The

61
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.046
irreplaceable engineer we set

62
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:51.746
out to be in

63
00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:52.507
the beginning of this

64
00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.805
course operates differently than

65
00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:56.265
engineers of today. We

66
00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:58.304
build the system that

67
00:01:58.304 --> 00:01:59.563
builds the system. We

68
00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:01.102
operate on the agentic
