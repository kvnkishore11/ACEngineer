574
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.938
ADW is calling an

575
00:13:32.038 --> 00:13:34.119
agent, okay? This is

576
00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:36.457
distinctly different from any

577
00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:37.538
other type of code.

578
00:13:37.738 --> 00:13:39.336
Okay. This script is

579
00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:41.176
the gateway into agentic

580
00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:42.155
coding, right? It's the

581
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.414
minimal version of what

582
00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:43.875
you need to get

583
00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:45.793
started. And yes, it

584
00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:46.673
is just calling a

585
00:13:46.673 --> 00:13:48.293
Claude Code instance and

586
00:13:48.293 --> 00:13:49.772
managing all the surrounding

587
00:13:49.772 --> 00:13:50.971
state. Just to mention

588
00:13:50.971 --> 00:13:52.230
it throughout the course,

589
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.350
we've been calling Claude

590
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.289
Code right through a

591
00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:56.749
bash command, but you

592
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:57.649
can use the Claude

593
00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:59.327
Code SDK, their support

594
00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:00.927
for both Python version
