1009
00:22:29.178 --> 00:22:30.196
right? And so this

1010
00:22:30.196 --> 00:22:31.037
is a powerful way

1011
00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:31.536
to do this. You'll

1012
00:22:31.536 --> 00:22:32.556
notice something very powerful

1013
00:22:32.556 --> 00:22:33.256
here too at the

1014
00:22:33.256 --> 00:22:33.875
end. At the end

1015
00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:34.335
of some of our

1016
00:22:34.335 --> 00:22:36.493
tasks, we have tags.

1017
00:22:36.614 --> 00:22:37.413
And so this is,

1018
00:22:37.413 --> 00:22:38.114
as you can imagine,

1019
00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:39.932
arbitrary information we're passing

1020
00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:40.872
in to our AI

1021
00:22:40.872 --> 00:22:42.592
developer workflows, right? That

1022
00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:43.750
changed the way the

1023
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.309
workflow runs. Opus obviously

1024
00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:47.582
kicks up our model,

1025
00:22:47.661 --> 00:22:48.221
and then we have

1026
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.338
a ADW plan implement

1027
00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.678
update task. So this

1028
00:22:51.678 --> 00:22:52.517
is going to run

1029
00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:54.036
a different AI developer

1030
00:22:54.036 --> 00:22:55.414
workflow for this set

1031
00:22:55.414 --> 00:22:56.233
of work. You can

1032
00:22:56.233 --> 00:22:57.292
see where this goes.

1033
00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:58.132
You can see our

1034
00:22:58.132 --> 00:22:59.132
agents are, I'm not

1035
00:22:59.132 --> 00:22:59.651
doing this by the

1036
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:00.410
way, right? This is
