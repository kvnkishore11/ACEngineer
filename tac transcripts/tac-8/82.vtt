WEBVTT

1900
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.679
interface to be generate.

1901
00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:02.476
Okay, and so two

1902
00:41:02.476 --> 00:41:04.175
agents operating for us,

1903
00:41:04.255 --> 00:41:05.414
right? They're off doing

1904
00:41:05.414 --> 00:41:06.373
work. How does this

1905
00:41:06.373 --> 00:41:07.693
work? We broke one

1906
00:41:07.693 --> 00:41:08.672
of our rules. Here

1907
00:41:08.672 --> 00:41:09.371
we go, check this

1908
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:10.949
out. Very, very cool.

1909
00:41:10.949 --> 00:41:12.188
We have a concise

1910
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:13.867
summary, right? We're talking

1911
00:41:13.867 --> 00:41:16.565
directly to our agents

1912
00:41:16.585 --> 00:41:18.445
from inside the application.

1913
00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:19.463
If we quickly glance

1914
00:41:19.463 --> 00:41:20.264
at the code, you

1915
00:41:20.264 --> 00:41:21.362
can see the exact

1916
00:41:21.362 --> 00:41:23.422
same structure. ADWs, this

1917
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:24.541
is the housing unit

1918
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:25.742
for the agentic layer

1919
00:41:25.822 --> 00:41:26.780
of your codebase.

1920
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.300
And then we have

1921
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.260
.Claude with our prompts

1922
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.920
where we put it

1923
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.760
all together. This is
