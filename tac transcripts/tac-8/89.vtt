2056
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.998
code plus agentics. When

2057
00:44:30.998 --> 00:44:32.157
you put those together

2058
00:44:32.318 --> 00:44:32.797
and you give them

2059
00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:33.737
to your agent and

2060
00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.036
you adopt their perspective,

2061
00:44:35.096 --> 00:44:36.554
anytime they're running, you'll

2062
00:44:36.554 --> 00:44:37.954
understand how to build

2063
00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:40.251
effective, powerful agents better

2064
00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:41.590
than anyone because they

2065
00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.550
have maximum leverage. When

2066
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.248
you do that, you

2067
00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.128
can focus in more

2068
00:44:45.128 --> 00:44:46.286
on the agentic layer

2069
00:44:46.327 --> 00:44:48.286
and template your engineering.

2070
00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.503
This is the way

2071
00:44:49.503 --> 00:44:50.559
to set up and

2072
00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.335
encode your engineering. You

2073
00:44:52.335 --> 00:44:54.590
use template meta prompts.

2074
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.548
prompts that output prompts

2075
00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:57.987
in specific formats with

2076
00:44:57.987 --> 00:45:00.746
specific rules, guidelines, files
