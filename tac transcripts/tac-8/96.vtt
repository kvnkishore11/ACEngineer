2215
00:47:59.032 --> 00:48:00.851
technology, okay? Especially if

2216
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:01.590
you're further in the

2217
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:02.630
past and you're not

2218
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.210
that far into the

2219
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.829
future, context windows are

2220
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:06.688
still small. So how

2221
00:48:06.688 --> 00:48:07.449
do we alleviate this

2222
00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:08.088
problem? How do we

2223
00:48:08.088 --> 00:48:09.688
sidestep it entirely? We

2224
00:48:09.688 --> 00:48:10.606
focus on building one

2225
00:48:10.606 --> 00:48:11.887
agent with one prompt

2226
00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:13.646
with a single purpose.

2227
00:48:13.646 --> 00:48:15.144
One purpose agents. You

2228
00:48:15.144 --> 00:48:16.684
saw this throughout every

2229
00:48:16.684 --> 00:48:17.503
codebase we worked

2230
00:48:17.523 --> 00:48:18.804
in. We're running one

2231
00:48:18.804 --> 00:48:20.302
Claude Code instance with

2232
00:48:20.302 --> 00:48:21.563
only one exception, right?

2233
00:48:21.563 --> 00:48:23.101
The only exception is

2234
00:48:23.425 --> 00:48:24.804
This codebase, okay?

2235
00:48:24.804 --> 00:48:25.603
This is the only

2236
00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:26.684
exception to that where

2237
00:48:26.684 --> 00:48:28.043
we are actually passing

2238
00:48:28.043 --> 00:48:29.001
back in the session

2239
00:48:29.001 --> 00:48:30.161
ID back into this
