00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:30.326
here. So this isn't

910
00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:31.744
important. Okay, what is

911
00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:33.825
important is our agentic

912
00:20:33.825 --> 00:20:34.884
layer. So whatever type

913
00:20:34.884 --> 00:20:35.884
of application layer you're

914
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:37.022
working with, every one

915
00:20:37.022 --> 00:20:38.042
of these agentic layers

916
00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:39.321
can be built for

917
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.201
your codebase. All

918
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:40.780
right, keep that in

919
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.800
mind. Now, how does

920
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.299
this work? We have

921
00:20:43.299 --> 00:20:45.655
a simple task management

922
00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:46.634
system. You can see

923
00:20:46.634 --> 00:20:47.311
we have this file

924
00:20:47.311 --> 00:20:49.407
down here, tasks.markdown. Let's

925
00:20:49.407 --> 00:20:50.645
open this up and

926
00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:52.063
break down what's going

927
00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:53.105
on here. Just by

928
00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:53.924
looking at this file,

929
00:20:53.924 --> 00:20:54.305
you should be able

930
00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:55.124
to understand that we

931
00:20:55.124 --> 00:20:56.522
have a multi-agent Git

932
00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:57.961
WorkTree based system here.

933
00:20:57.981 --> 00:20:58.622
And so again, this

934
00:20:58.622 --> 00:20:59.661
is just another way

935
00:20:59.661 --> 00:21:00.681
you can organize. I'm
