1861
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:01.123
that you've seen before.

1862
00:40:01.123 --> 00:40:01.744
So let me just

1863
00:40:01.744 --> 00:40:04.302
go ahead, shscripts start

1864
00:40:05.063 --> 00:40:10.219
and shscripts aeserver start.

1865
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:10.619
And so we have

1866
00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:11.860
something really, really, really

1867
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.219
cool here. So I'm

1868
00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:16.538
gonna boot this open

1869
00:40:16.817 --> 00:40:17.556
and you'll see something

1870
00:40:17.556 --> 00:40:18.677
very familiar. We have

1871
00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:19.795
the natural language SQL

1872
00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:20.456
interface that we've been

1873
00:40:20.456 --> 00:40:21.155
working in throughout the

1874
00:40:21.155 --> 00:40:22.275
course. Okay. It looks

1875
00:40:22.275 --> 00:40:23.534
like our exact same

1876
00:40:23.773 --> 00:40:24.893
codebase. but this

1877
00:40:24.893 --> 00:40:26.952
is actually very different.

1878
00:40:26.952 --> 00:40:27.652
If we type command

1879
00:40:27.652 --> 00:40:29.431
P here, slash AEA,

1880
00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:30.530
we have an agent
