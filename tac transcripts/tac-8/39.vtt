863
00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:31.592
examples here and showcase

864
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.152
the result of the

865
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.270
agentic layer, right? Showcase

866
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.171
what the agentic layer

867
00:19:35.171 --> 00:19:36.349
will give you as

868
00:19:36.349 --> 00:19:37.049
you make the layer

869
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.568
thicker and thicker and

870
00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:39.428
thicker, and as the

871
00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:40.948
agentic layer operates on

872
00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.307
your codebase, okay?

873
00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:43.106
So this is fantastic.

874
00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:43.685
Let's go ahead and

875
00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.230
open up. the next

876
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.548
layer back in tech

877
00:19:46.588 --> 00:19:47.847
eight. Let's open up

878
00:19:47.928 --> 00:19:49.507
the multi-agent to done

879
00:19:49.646 --> 00:19:50.906
application, not to do

880
00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:52.625
to done. Okay. So

881
00:19:52.645 --> 00:19:53.744
to done, what does

882
00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:54.683
this do? If we

883
00:19:54.703 --> 00:19:55.804
open up our apps

884
00:19:55.804 --> 00:19:56.663
here, you can see

885
00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:58.182
we're working in a

886
00:19:58.182 --> 00:20:00.421
data science, classical Jupiter
