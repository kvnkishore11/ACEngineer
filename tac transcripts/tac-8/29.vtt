618
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:31.620
more complex, sophisticated, tying

619
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.821
them together with the

620
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:34.500
right engineering workflows that

621
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.160
actually deliver work for

622
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.179
you, okay? This is

623
00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.679
it. This is the

624
00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:39.240
thinnest layer. And now

625
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.240
we can stack this

626
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.678
up and start progressing.

627
00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:42.818
Inside of the ADW

628
00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:44.239
slash command, we can

629
00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:45.418
call any slash command

630
00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:46.198
we want. So say

631
00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:46.817
we wanted to run

632
00:14:46.817 --> 00:14:48.618
that slash start, we

633
00:14:48.618 --> 00:14:50.037
can Just fire this

634
00:14:50.037 --> 00:14:51.495
off and just like

635
00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:52.453
operating in a Claude

636
00:14:52.453 --> 00:14:53.773
Code instance, right? Just

637
00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:54.591
like being in the

638
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:55.929
loop by creating a

639
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:57.467
script that can surround

640
00:14:57.467 --> 00:14:58.547
the application, that can

641
00:14:58.547 --> 00:14:59.725
surround any unit of

642
00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:01.123
code, we are slowly
