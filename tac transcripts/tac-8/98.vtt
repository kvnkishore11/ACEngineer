2260
00:48:58.621 --> 00:49:00.400
engineering. As you progress

2261
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.260
and your agentic layer

2262
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.159
becomes ultra thick, something

2263
00:49:03.159 --> 00:49:04.418
incredible will happen when

2264
00:49:04.418 --> 00:49:05.277
you ship a workflow

2265
00:49:05.297 --> 00:49:06.237
end to end and

2266
00:49:06.237 --> 00:49:07.436
you really dial in

2267
00:49:07.516 --> 00:49:09.036
the AI developer workflow.

2268
00:49:09.096 --> 00:49:10.135
You will become a

2269
00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:11.835
bottleneck in the process.

2270
00:49:11.835 --> 00:49:12.815
The time you spend,

2271
00:49:12.815 --> 00:49:13.994
the resources you spend

2272
00:49:14.054 --> 00:49:15.193
reviewing the work will

2273
00:49:15.193 --> 00:49:16.452
be useless. And then

2274
00:49:16.452 --> 00:49:17.552
something incredible will happen.

2275
00:49:17.672 --> 00:49:18.632
You realize you're the

2276
00:49:18.632 --> 00:49:19.610
bottleneck and then you'll

2277
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.451
convert the Outloop framework

2278
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:22.949
from Peter to Pete.

2279
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.068
Prompt input trigger environment.

2280
00:49:25.188 --> 00:49:26.307
No review. Okay. You'll

2281
00:49:26.307 --> 00:49:27.088
drop the R off.

2282
00:49:27.327 --> 00:49:28.327
This of course won't

2283
00:49:28.327 --> 00:49:29.547
happen overnight. There's no

2284
00:49:29.547 --> 00:49:30.507
black and white in
