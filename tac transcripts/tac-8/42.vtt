935
00:20:59.661 --> 00:21:00.681
you can organize. I'm

936
00:21:00.681 --> 00:21:02.259
going to paste in

937
00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:03.159
a new set of

938
00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:04.317
prompts here for our

939
00:21:04.317 --> 00:21:05.357
task list. So I'm

940
00:21:05.357 --> 00:21:06.297
just gonna paste this

941
00:21:06.297 --> 00:21:06.916
in. We're gonna have

942
00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:07.695
our agents get to

943
00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:08.575
work on this, okay?

944
00:21:08.755 --> 00:21:09.375
So you can see

945
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:11.013
here, we're working across

946
00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:12.553
five Git WorkTrees. They're

947
00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:13.451
just going to do

948
00:21:13.612 --> 00:21:14.570
engineering work for us,

949
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.269
right? Across five WorkTrees.

950
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.950
So let's kick this

951
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.949
off. We of course

952
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:18.608
are going to open

953
00:21:18.608 --> 00:21:19.627
up our AI developer

954
00:21:19.627 --> 00:21:20.767
workflows. This is where

955
00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:22.066
the agentic layer is

956
00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:23.789
managed. and we have

957
00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:24.809
our trigger. So our

958
00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:25.890
trigger is how we

959
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.209
stay out the loop,

960
00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.288
right? This is pushing

961
00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:29.548
us from in loop

962
00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:30.528
to out loop and
