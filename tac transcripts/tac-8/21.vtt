443
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:30.711
It can search your

444
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:31.669
codebase, it can

445
00:10:31.669 --> 00:10:32.870
navigate, It can make

446
00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:34.730
connections faster than we

447
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.948
can, and it's going

448
00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:37.249
to continue to improve

449
00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:38.408
faster and faster, and

450
00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:38.869
it's going to get

451
00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:40.048
better and better. Okay,

452
00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:41.607
so here we're templating

453
00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:42.768
our engineering. And while

454
00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:43.648
we're working through this,

455
00:10:43.648 --> 00:10:44.607
right, while you're building

456
00:10:44.648 --> 00:10:45.988
out your meta prompts,

457
00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:46.606
you want to be

458
00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:47.667
thinking from your agent's

459
00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.567
perspective. Is this the

460
00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:51.047
engineering workflow and the

461
00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:52.167
pattern that you would

462
00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:53.525
use to solve the

463
00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:55.005
problem set at hand?

464
00:10:55.105 --> 00:10:56.125
And notice how we're

465
00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.283
focusing on problem sets.

466
00:10:57.283 --> 00:10:58.344
We're focusing on problem

467
00:10:58.364 --> 00:11:01.101
classes, not one-off fixes,
