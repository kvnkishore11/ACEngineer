555
00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:01.543
this to understand where

556
00:13:01.543 --> 00:13:02.501
and what the output

557
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:03.782
looks like from this

558
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.302
Claude Code agent. This

559
00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:06.062
is where it all

560
00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:07.500
starts, okay? So we

561
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.821
can just quickly run

562
00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.841
a concise prompt here,

563
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.440
clear this instance, paste

564
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.220
this, and I'll just

565
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.599
say, list all files

566
00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:18.198
in the ADWs directory

567
00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:20.577
and a concise output

568
00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:22.442
of their purpose. So

569
00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:23.481
we can paste this,

570
00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:24.721
I'll update the path

571
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.201
to ADWs, and then

572
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:28.399
we can execute this

573
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.940
top level script. This
