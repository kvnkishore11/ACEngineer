1108
00:24:29.042 --> 00:24:30.481
our cron trigger. I'm

1109
00:24:30.481 --> 00:24:31.402
not gonna dive into

1110
00:24:31.402 --> 00:24:32.280
all this. You have

1111
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.340
all this code available

1112
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.299
to you, right? So

1113
00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:35.000
after you finish this

1114
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.200
lesson, your final lesson

1115
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.739
here, dive in, understand

1116
00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:38.499
what you can do.

1117
00:24:38.838 --> 00:24:39.718
Okay, these are all

1118
00:24:39.718 --> 00:24:41.157
example starting points. Then

1119
00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:41.916
same kind of deal

1120
00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:42.517
here, right? We have

1121
00:24:42.517 --> 00:24:43.895
that same ADW prompt,

1122
00:24:43.895 --> 00:24:44.715
we have slash command,

1123
00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:45.395
but then we have

1124
00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:48.494
real useful composed developer

1125
00:24:48.494 --> 00:24:50.634
workflows, right? Workflows that

1126
00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:52.173
put together prompts and

1127
00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:53.532
code to do real

1128
00:24:53.532 --> 00:24:54.632
engineering work. Most of

1129
00:24:54.632 --> 00:24:55.751
these workflows are just

1130
00:24:55.751 --> 00:24:56.990
going to kick off

1131
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.351
the build update task.

1132
00:24:58.351 --> 00:24:58.829
If you just search

1133
00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:00.509
for build, update task,
