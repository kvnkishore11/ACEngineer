1972
00:42:29.722 --> 00:42:30.583
a lot of what

1973
00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:32.342
matters here is key

1974
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:34.360
beliefs around what is

1975
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.400
possible with agents at

1976
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.860
your side, with compute,

1977
00:42:38.018 --> 00:42:39.918
with intelligence that you

1978
00:42:39.918 --> 00:42:41.217
can now orchestrate. You

1979
00:42:41.217 --> 00:42:42.097
can see here throughout

1980
00:42:42.097 --> 00:42:42.976
these, you know, just

1981
00:42:42.976 --> 00:42:44.635
three, four examples, there

1982
00:42:44.635 --> 00:42:46.215
are many permutations of

1983
00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:47.175
the agentic layer of

1984
00:42:47.175 --> 00:42:48.295
your codebase. This

1985
00:42:48.335 --> 00:42:48.954
is the place to

1986
00:42:48.954 --> 00:42:50.293
focus, right? This is

1987
00:42:50.293 --> 00:42:51.432
what it's all about

1988
00:42:51.432 --> 00:42:52.233
now. You can see

1989
00:42:52.233 --> 00:42:52.713
this is just a

1990
00:42:52.733 --> 00:42:55.311
very primitive, presentational version.

1991
00:42:55.351 --> 00:42:56.311
You can make your

1992
00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:57.411
own fully built out

1993
00:42:57.451 --> 00:42:59.251
agents inside your application

1994
00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:01.090
that can operate your
