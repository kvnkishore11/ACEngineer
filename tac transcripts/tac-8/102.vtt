2345
00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:01.144
old world of deterministic

2346
00:51:01.164 --> 00:51:02.244
code and the new

2347
00:51:02.244 --> 00:51:04.742
world of agentic prompts.

2348
00:51:04.822 --> 00:51:05.822
This is the agentic

2349
00:51:05.822 --> 00:51:06.621
layer. This is the

2350
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:07.860
layer that can operate

2351
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.021
on your codebase

2352
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:10.360
with the highest leverage

2353
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.619
point of Agentic Coding,

2354
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.818
the AI developer workflow.

2355
00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:15.097
And so we prioritize

2356
00:51:15.097 --> 00:51:16.657
agentics because our agents

2357
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:17.697
can ship better and

2358
00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:18.956
faster than us. Don't

2359
00:51:18.956 --> 00:51:19.916
make the mistake of

2360
00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:21.135
thinking that you can

2361
00:51:21.135 --> 00:51:23.594
outperform your team's best

2362
00:51:23.695 --> 00:51:25.873
engineering practices encoded into

2363
00:51:25.893 --> 00:51:27.153
a template metaprompt that

2364
00:51:27.153 --> 00:51:28.454
runs in an AI

2365
00:51:28.454 --> 00:51:30.333
developer workflow that kicks
