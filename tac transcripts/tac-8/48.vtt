WEBVTT

1084
00:23:59.857 --> 00:24:00.977
kicking off. We're adding

1085
00:24:00.977 --> 00:24:02.156
25 edge cases to

1086
00:24:02.156 --> 00:24:03.415
our tweet CSV. We

1087
00:24:03.415 --> 00:24:04.175
need to do some

1088
00:24:04.175 --> 00:24:05.414
update work for the

1089
00:24:05.414 --> 00:24:06.575
CSV to make the

1090
00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:08.153
data richer. Whatever work

1091
00:24:08.153 --> 00:24:08.992
you're doing, you know,

1092
00:24:08.992 --> 00:24:10.272
you can agents, they're

1093
00:24:10.272 --> 00:24:11.332
operating on this, right?

1094
00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:11.672
So this is very

1095
00:24:11.672 --> 00:24:12.392
cool. You can see

1096
00:24:12.392 --> 00:24:13.131
one of our tasks

1097
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:15.170
completed. We have the

1098
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.469
ADWID and the Git

1099
00:24:16.469 --> 00:24:17.169
hash. And so we

1100
00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:18.728
created this filtered data

1101
00:24:18.728 --> 00:24:20.946
set, tweets positive only.

1102
00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.125
Okay. And so how

1103
00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:22.945
does this work, right?

1104
00:24:23.205 --> 00:24:24.325
It's all thanks to

1105
00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:25.943
our agentic layer. This

1106
00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:27.344
is a slightly thicker

1107
00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:28.903
agentic layer. We're running

1108
00:24:29.042 --> 00:24:30.481
our cron trigger. I'm
