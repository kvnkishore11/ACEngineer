811
00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:30.112
of problems. Right here,

812
00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:30.911
we're creating a plan

813
00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:32.211
and we're building. The

814
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:33.289
way we plan and

815
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:34.250
the thing we build

816
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.628
completely depends on your

817
00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:36.548
use case, but you

818
00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:37.307
can see here we

819
00:18:37.307 --> 00:18:38.728
have a plan generated,

820
00:18:38.907 --> 00:18:39.606
right? It's gonna be

821
00:18:39.606 --> 00:18:41.027
super, super simple, but

822
00:18:41.027 --> 00:18:41.746
it has all of

823
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.506
our engineering practices encoded

824
00:18:43.506 --> 00:18:44.724
from the template meta

825
00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:45.444
prompt. And then of

826
00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:47.183
course apps right here,

827
00:18:47.263 --> 00:18:47.843
we're gonna see this

828
00:18:47.843 --> 00:18:48.803
new file pop up

829
00:18:48.803 --> 00:18:49.782
here in just a

830
00:18:49.782 --> 00:18:50.922
moment, right? We're implementing

831
00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:51.961
the plan. There it

832
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:54.361
is, main.sh, great. And

833
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.440
our agent will love

834
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.359
likely automatically validate this.

835
00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:57.778
Yeah. So it's going

836
00:18:57.778 --> 00:18:58.919
to run this. It's

837
00:18:58.919 --> 00:18:59.318
going to do this

838
00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:00.239
work for us, right?
