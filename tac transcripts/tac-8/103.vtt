2365
00:51:28.454 --> 00:51:30.333
developer workflow that kicks

2366
00:51:30.333 --> 00:51:31.353
off five to ten

2367
00:51:31.353 --> 00:51:33.751
agents per problem. You

2368
00:51:34.012 --> 00:51:35.391
know, like don't try

2369
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:36.231
to compete with that,

2370
00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:37.572
right? Your place of

2371
00:51:37.572 --> 00:51:39.411
competition is now net

2372
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:41.590
new innovation. It's building

2373
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:42.630
on the agentic layer.

2374
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.442
It's using compute to

2375
00:51:44.442 --> 00:51:45.262
solve problems in an

2376
00:51:45.262 --> 00:51:46.681
interesting way. And this

2377
00:51:46.681 --> 00:51:47.340
is all because you

2378
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.621
can teach compute how

2379
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:49.400
to build. You can

2380
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.420
teach compute how to

2381
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.860
engineer your way. Okay.

2382
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.860
Here at the end

2383
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.139
of tactical Agentic Coding,

2384
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.699
let's take this all

2385
00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:57.159
the way and compress

2386
00:51:57.159 --> 00:51:58.860
our KPIs, our agentic

2387
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.440
concepts, our leverage points
