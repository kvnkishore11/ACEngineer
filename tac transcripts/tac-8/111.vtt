2544
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:30.471
irreplaceable engineer that builds

2545
00:55:30.471 --> 00:55:32.409
the system, that builds

2546
00:55:32.469 --> 00:55:34.070
the system. An agentic

2547
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.989
engineer operates on living

2548
00:55:36.028 --> 00:55:37.668
pieces of software that

2549
00:55:37.728 --> 00:55:39.168
work while they sleep.

2550
00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:39.947
And so this is

2551
00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:40.487
it. This is the

2552
00:55:40.487 --> 00:55:42.126
framing. This is tactical

2553
00:55:42.126 --> 00:55:43.567
Agentic Coding. You have

2554
00:55:43.686 --> 00:55:44.965
everything you need to

2555
00:55:44.965 --> 00:55:46.405
become an Agentic Engineer

2556
00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:47.418
now. All you have

2557
00:55:47.418 --> 00:55:48.456
to do is answer

2558
00:55:48.456 --> 00:55:49.476
the question every day

2559
00:55:49.476 --> 00:55:50.215
when you sit down

2560
00:55:50.215 --> 00:55:51.014
to work. Am I

2561
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:51.994
working on the agentic

2562
00:55:51.994 --> 00:55:52.833
layer or am I

2563
00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:53.873
working on the application

2564
00:55:53.873 --> 00:55:54.972
layer? If you're working

2565
00:55:54.972 --> 00:55:56.112
on the agentic layer,

2566
00:55:56.132 --> 00:55:56.811
you're likely moving in

2567
00:55:56.811 --> 00:55:58.791
the right direction. Command

2568
00:55:58.871 --> 00:56:00.269
your agentic layer to
