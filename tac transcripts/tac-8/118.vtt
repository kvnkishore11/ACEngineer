to you. One more

2712
00:59:10.001 --> 00:59:11.440
thing, your engineering feedback

2713
00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.639
is ultra valuable. At

2714
00:59:12.639 --> 00:59:12.980

ideas, several high return

2721
00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.916
on investment directions for

2722
00:59:21.916 --> 00:59:23.375
engineers, gaps in the

2723
00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:24.514
market that I'm seeing.

2724
00:59:24.514 --> 00:59:25.273

prioritizable. So depending on
