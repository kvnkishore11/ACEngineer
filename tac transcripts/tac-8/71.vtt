00:35:29.943 --> 00:35:30.443
zoom out a little

1647
00:35:30.443 --> 00:35:30.943
bit so you can

1648
00:35:30.943 --> 00:35:31.822
see the done column

1649
00:35:31.822 --> 00:35:32.862
as well not started

1650
00:35:32.862 --> 00:35:33.963
in progress human in

1651
00:35:33.963 --> 00:35:35.382
the loop review failed

1652
00:35:35.422 --> 00:35:36.242
and done and you

1653
00:35:36.242 --> 00:35:37.503
can just manage everything

1654
00:35:37.503 --> 00:35:38.382
here always remember the

1655
00:35:38.382 --> 00:35:39.583
peter framework this is

1656
00:35:39.583 --> 00:35:40.922
a review system that

1657
00:35:40.922 --> 00:35:41.443
you can use to

1658
00:35:41.443 --> 00:35:43.143
just quickly operate outside

1659
00:35:43.143 --> 00:35:44.282
the loop whenever i

1660
00:35:44.282 --> 00:35:45.202
need to on my

1661
00:35:45.382 --> 00:35:46.302
mobile device on a

1662
00:35:46.302 --> 00:35:47.621
different device you know

1663
00:35:47.621 --> 00:35:48.802
even sitting right here

1664
00:35:48.822 --> 00:35:49.842
right I can just

1665
00:35:49.842 --> 00:35:51.742
quickly gather some documentation

1666
00:35:51.842 --> 00:35:52.317
write up a quick

1667
00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:54.121
prompt. fire off one

1668
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:55.521
of my templates and

1669
00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:56.460
generate an entirely new

1670
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.840
application here at light

1671
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.838
speed, right? This is

1672
00:35:58.838 --> 00:35:59.858
something your agents can

1673
00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:00.878
do, right? Yet another
