2058
00:42:59.057 --> 00:43:00.057
here. Let's just go

2059
00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:00.981
ahead, create a new

2060
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:01.702
task, we're gonna do

2061
00:43:01.702 --> 00:43:03.181
something really stupid and

2062
00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:04.019
simple. I just wanna

2063
00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.760
showcase the workflow and

2064
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.478
showcase the capabilities that

2065
00:43:07.478 --> 00:43:08.557
you can build into

2066
00:43:08.557 --> 00:43:09.998
your user interfaces with

2067
00:43:10.117 --> 00:43:12.675
agents. So update titles,

2068
00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:13.356
this is just gonna

2069
00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:14.594
be super simple, update

2070
00:43:14.594 --> 00:43:16.494
the HTML title and

2071
00:43:16.494 --> 00:43:18.074
header title to be

2072
00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:20.632
plan, build, review, and

2073
00:43:20.632 --> 00:43:22.532
ship agents. Okay, and

2074
00:43:22.532 --> 00:43:23.271
now we have that

2075
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:24.291
here, right, update titles,

2076
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:24.751
and then we just

2077
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:25.670
drag it into plan.

2078
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:26.730
And now this workflow

2079
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.389
is gonna kick off,

2080
00:43:27.389 --> 00:43:27.809
let's go ahead and

2081
00:43:27.809 --> 00:43:29.648
refocus on the actual

2082
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.507
agent running on the
