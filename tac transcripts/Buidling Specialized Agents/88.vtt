2106
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.429
change, this isn't rocket

2107
00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:01.228
science, but we should

2108
00:44:01.228 --> 00:44:02.628
see our title update

2109
00:44:02.628 --> 00:44:03.588
here. And we should

2110
00:44:03.588 --> 00:44:05.146
see our HTML title

2111
00:44:05.146 --> 00:44:06.067
update as well, right?

2112
00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:07.306
It is operating on

2113
00:44:07.306 --> 00:44:08.045
itself. Couple of cool

2114
00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:09.125
things, right? You can

2115
00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:09.744
kind of build out

2116
00:44:09.744 --> 00:44:11.684
your own multi-agent orchestration

2117
00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:13.083
system, however you want.

2118
00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.443
We have the messages

2119
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:14.963
on the left, so

2120
00:44:14.963 --> 00:44:16.541
the total messages getting

2121
00:44:16.693 --> 00:44:17.951
streamed to the front

2122
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:19.208
end via WebSockets. And

2123
00:44:19.208 --> 00:44:19.547
then we have the

2124
00:44:19.547 --> 00:44:20.945
total tool calls on

2125
00:44:20.945 --> 00:44:22.262
the right. Okay, so

2126
00:44:22.262 --> 00:44:23.161
our agent is working.

2127
00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:23.820
You can see there

2128
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.809
the planning is incrementing,

2129
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:26.309
but you can see

2130
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:27.989
here our builder agent

2131
00:44:28.007 --> 00:44:29.708
is now processing. And

2132
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:30.306
this is really cool,
