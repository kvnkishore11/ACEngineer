3196
01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:30.393
There are tons of

3197
01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.452
ideas. Whatever you want

3198
01:05:31.472 --> 01:05:32.711
to see next, place

3199
01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:33.911
your vote. After about

3200
01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:35.911
500 to 1,000 votes,

3201
01:05:35.911 --> 01:05:36.590
I'm going to take

3202
01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:37.289
these, I'm going to

3203
01:05:37.289 --> 01:05:38.090
tally it, and I'm

3204
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:38.949
going to build a

3205
01:05:38.949 --> 01:05:41.128
lesson, a hyper-focused lesson

3206
01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:43.047
on the topic you

3207
01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:44.288
and other engineers decide.

3208
01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:45.427
Obviously here, we're focused

3209
01:05:45.427 --> 01:05:46.427
on the bleeding edge

3210
01:05:46.427 --> 01:05:48.286
use case of agents.

3211
01:05:48.481 --> 01:05:49.760
core four, the key

3212
01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.221
ideas embedded in TAC.

3213
01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:51.800
If this works out

3214
01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.000
well, I'll do more

3215
01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:54.539
vote-based lessons. So place

3216
01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:55.478
your vote there and

3217
01:05:55.478 --> 01:05:57.038
you'll guide the future

3218
01:05:57.117 --> 01:05:59.097
of the agentic horizon.

3219
01:05:59.177 --> 01:05:59.777
This codebase is

3220
01:05:59.777 --> 01:06:00.496
gonna be available to
