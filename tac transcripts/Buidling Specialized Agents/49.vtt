WEBVTT

1141
00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:30.163
our worker. And inside

1142
00:24:30.163 --> 00:24:31.124
of our worker, we

1143
00:24:31.124 --> 00:24:32.563
are firing off. We

1144
00:24:32.563 --> 00:24:33.123
should be able to

1145
00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:33.922
see that pretty soon

1146
00:24:33.922 --> 00:24:35.642
here. Queue task, filtering

1147
00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:36.901
the content. And if

1148
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:37.520
we have a match

1149
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.799
keyword, we increase our

1150
00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:39.960
match. We create this

1151
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.919
object and then we

1152
00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:41.538
put it on a

1153
00:24:41.538 --> 00:24:42.557
queue. Of course, what

1154
00:24:42.557 --> 00:24:43.258
does our queue do?

1155
00:24:43.377 --> 00:24:44.458
You could guess exactly

1156
00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:45.596
what this does. Our

1157
00:24:45.596 --> 00:24:47.115
queue kicks off. You

1158
00:24:47.115 --> 00:24:48.394
guessed it. If we

1159
00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:49.633
open up Analyze and

1160
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.830
Notify, we can see

1161
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.990
here, we have a

1162
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.628
Claude Code SDK client.

1163
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:53.969
All right, so you

1164
00:24:53.969 --> 00:24:54.768
can always just search

1165
00:24:54.768 --> 00:24:55.748
for these inside this

1166
00:24:55.748 --> 00:24:57.326
codebases to understand

1167
00:24:57.366 --> 00:24:58.767
where your custom agents

1168
00:24:58.767 --> 00:24:59.445
are getting set up.

1169
00:24:59.445 --> 00:25:00.486
So first things first,
