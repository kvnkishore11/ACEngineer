1958
00:40:59.447 --> 00:41:00.226
last one. So here

1959
00:41:00.226 --> 00:41:00.867
we of course just

1960
00:41:00.867 --> 00:41:02.387
referencing this variable that

1961
00:41:02.387 --> 00:41:03.246
we're declaring at the

1962
00:41:03.246 --> 00:41:04.126
top of the file,

1963
00:41:04.126 --> 00:41:05.206
powerful language models will

1964
00:41:05.206 --> 00:41:06.027
be able to reference

1965
00:41:06.027 --> 00:41:06.947
this and know exactly

1966
00:41:06.947 --> 00:41:07.746
what we mean here.

1967
00:41:07.806 --> 00:41:08.985
All right, so fantastic.

1968
00:41:08.985 --> 00:41:09.405
So this is the

1969
00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:10.965
system prompt, this controls

1970
00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:11.706
the behavior of our

1971
00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:13.126
agents, I highly recommend

1972
00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:15.117
whatever response format you

1973
00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:16.556
return from your agents

1974
00:41:16.556 --> 00:41:17.675
if you're responding with

1975
00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:18.773
JSON, you create a

1976
00:41:18.773 --> 00:41:20.311
concrete object. If we

1977
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.231
search that here, you

1978
00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:21.851
can see we have

1979
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:23.489
this in a field,

1980
00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.028
right? In a Pydantic

1981
00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:26.148
class. If you're in

1982
00:41:26.148 --> 00:41:27.168
TypeScript land, you'll use

1983
00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:28.407
Zod, but here we

1984
00:41:28.407 --> 00:41:29.887
use Pydantic, all right?

1985
00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:31.565
So response format, multi-version
