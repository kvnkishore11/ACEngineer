3076
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.800
need to fine tune

3077
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.840
just a little bit,

3078
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.480
hide a couple of

3079
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.440
tools, do a couple

3080
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.679
of tweaks. Our plan

3081
01:03:04.679 --> 01:03:05.838
agent, it only needed

3082
01:03:05.838 --> 01:03:06.737
to write the spec.

3083
01:03:06.737 --> 01:03:07.637
That's it. Everything else

3084
01:03:07.637 --> 01:03:08.936
was reading tools. You

3085
01:03:08.936 --> 01:03:09.737
get the idea, all

3086
01:03:09.737 --> 01:03:10.775
right? The big idea

3087
01:03:10.775 --> 01:03:11.416
here is I wanna

3088
01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:12.416
communicate to you that

3089
01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:13.715
you don't need custom

3090
01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:14.833
agents. I think if

3091
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:15.813
you're pushing all the

3092
01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:16.253
way to the edge

3093
01:03:16.253 --> 01:03:17.592
of agentic engineering, you

3094
01:03:17.592 --> 01:03:18.952
will end up building

3095
01:03:18.952 --> 01:03:20.532
custom agents. it's better

3096
01:03:20.532 --> 01:03:21.652
agents then it's more

3097
01:03:21.652 --> 01:03:22.452
agents and then it's

3098
01:03:22.452 --> 01:03:24.132
custom agents but i

3099
01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:24.791
will say and i

3100
01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:25.431
want to make this

3101
01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:26.590
super clear you can

3102
01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:28.490
just extend agents right

3103
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.431
build extended agents use
