834
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:30.028
can see just based

835
00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:30.968
on the tool, right?

836
00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:32.107
The tool decorator, we

837
00:18:32.107 --> 00:18:33.707
have custom math, perform

838
00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:36.286
mathematical calculations, expression, precision.

839
00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:36.986
All right, not a

840
00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:37.746
lot happening here. We're

841
00:18:37.746 --> 00:18:39.125
running the eval to

842
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:40.184
do some math. In

843
00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:41.124
your tools, you're back

844
00:18:41.124 --> 00:18:42.443
in deterministic world. Do

845
00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:43.663
whatever you want. Just

846
00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:44.643
set up the input

847
00:18:44.663 --> 00:18:45.303
and set up the

848
00:18:45.303 --> 00:18:47.282
output properly. And if

849
00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:49.321
something goes wrong, communicate

850
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.082
that back to your

851
00:18:50.082 --> 00:18:51.240
agent. Your agent can

852
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.320
pivot, right? This is

853
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.020
part of the advantage

854
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.359
of scaling LLMs into

855
00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.818
prompt chains and then

856
00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.419
into agents. They can

857
00:18:59.459 --> 00:19:01.817
reflect, improve, change, but
