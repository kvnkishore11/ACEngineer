WEBVTT

937
00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:30.582
we can get our

938
00:20:30.582 --> 00:20:31.861
total costs here. This

939
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:33.140
is just information on

940
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.577
the message when you're

941
00:20:34.577 --> 00:20:36.836
operating a result message,

942
00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:37.576
okay? And so we

943
00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:38.894
use this to continue

944
00:20:38.894 --> 00:20:40.097
the session. Right. And

945
00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:41.096
that's what this resume

946
00:20:41.096 --> 00:20:42.336
parameter does. So we

947
00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:43.076
can just keep prompting

948
00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:43.675
back and forth. We

949
00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.095
have our own micro

950
00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:46.095
agent that we can

951
00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:47.314
chat to in the

952
00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.493
terminal over and over

953
00:20:48.493 --> 00:20:49.233
and over. Okay. So

954
00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:49.833
this is a form

955
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:50.913
factor you can use.

956
00:20:50.972 --> 00:20:51.912
Of course, after you

957
00:20:51.912 --> 00:20:53.311
finish this lesson, everything

958
00:20:53.311 --> 00:20:53.750
is going to be

959
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.891
available to you in

960
00:20:54.891 --> 00:20:55.651
this codebase. It's

961
00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:56.089
going to help you

962
00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.549
quick start building your

963
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:58.469
own custom agents and

964
00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.068
understanding what you can
