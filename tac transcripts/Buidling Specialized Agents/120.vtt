2922
00:59:59.568 --> 01:00:01.224
You can use different

2923
01:00:01.224 --> 01:00:02.222
elements of your clock

2924
01:00:02.242 --> 01:00:03.380
code options to make

2925
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.398
sure your agent doesn't

2926
01:00:04.398 --> 01:00:05.715
cause issues, okay? But

2927
01:00:05.715 --> 01:00:07.032
most importantly, you know,

2928
01:00:07.052 --> 01:00:07.632
a big idea we

2929
01:00:07.632 --> 01:00:08.670
talk about in TAC

2930
01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:09.753
You build custom agents

2931
01:00:09.753 --> 01:00:10.472
when you want to

2932
01:00:10.472 --> 01:00:11.811
stay out of the

2933
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:12.690
loop. These are the

2934
01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.349
high level reasons why

2935
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:15.268
you should build a

2936
01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:17.206
custom agent. Now, that

2937
01:00:17.206 --> 01:00:18.244
doesn't mean that you

2938
01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:19.423
always should. It is

2939
01:00:19.423 --> 01:00:20.222
natural that if you're

2940
01:00:20.222 --> 01:00:21.422
pushing compute to its

2941
01:00:21.422 --> 01:00:22.740
limits, you will end

2942
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.159
up at custom agents.

2943
01:00:24.159 --> 01:00:24.838
But for a lot

2944
01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:25.757
of use cases, out

2945
01:00:25.757 --> 01:00:27.036
of the box agents

2946
01:00:27.117 --> 01:00:28.195
are good enough. So

2947
01:00:28.215 --> 01:00:29.394
if you're operating in

2948
01:00:29.394 --> 01:00:30.518
the loop, like many
