1063
00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:00.174
doing? You can see

1064
00:23:00.174 --> 00:23:01.515
tool called. We always

1065
00:23:01.515 --> 00:23:02.374
know when our agents

1066
00:23:02.374 --> 00:23:03.534
are calling tools. I

1067
00:23:03.534 --> 00:23:04.673
highly recommend you build

1068
00:23:04.673 --> 00:23:06.392
out logging observability with

1069
00:23:06.392 --> 00:23:07.412
your agent responses so

1070
00:23:07.412 --> 00:23:08.671
that you can understand

1071
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:09.750
what's happening and when

1072
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.269
it's happening. Submit analysis.

1073
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:13.489
Anytime our keyword matches

1074
00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:15.288
via deterministic code, our

1075
00:23:15.288 --> 00:23:16.248
agent is kicking off

1076
00:23:16.347 --> 00:23:16.826
and is doing a

1077
00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:18.547
sentiment analysis with the

1078
00:23:18.547 --> 00:23:19.986
submit analysis tool call.

1079
00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.285
Then if it finds

1080
00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:22.964
a message that matches

1081
00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:24.604
our notification process, that

1082
00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:25.243
we passed in at

1083
00:23:25.243 --> 00:23:26.063
the start, right? If

1084
00:23:26.063 --> 00:23:26.682
we hit up here,

1085
00:23:26.682 --> 00:23:27.163
you can see that

1086
00:23:27.163 --> 00:23:29.042
exact notification prompt. It

1087
00:23:29.042 --> 00:23:29.902
will then kick off

1088
00:23:29.902 --> 00:23:31.041
an alert to us.
