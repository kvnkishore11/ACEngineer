2822
00:57:59.556 --> 00:58:00.695
and we have find

2823
00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:01.576
logs for users. Let's

2824
00:58:01.576 --> 00:58:02.056
go ahead and run

2825
00:58:02.056 --> 00:58:02.934
that, right? So find

2826
00:58:02.934 --> 00:58:04.514
logs for user and

2827
00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:05.494
let's just find all

2828
00:58:05.494 --> 00:58:06.574
these since it caused

2829
00:58:06.574 --> 00:58:07.652
the error. I want

2830
00:58:07.672 --> 00:58:08.273
to see all these

2831
00:58:08.273 --> 00:58:09.271
logs about this user,

2832
00:58:09.572 --> 00:58:11.291
summary only. So our

2833
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:11.751
agent is going to

2834
00:58:11.751 --> 00:58:13.070
think about that and

2835
00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:14.610
process that for us,

2836
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.829
right? There's that tool.

2837
00:58:15.869 --> 00:58:17.148
We should get a

2838
00:58:17.148 --> 00:58:18.648
response message out of

2839
00:58:18.648 --> 00:58:19.547
this because this is

2840
00:58:19.547 --> 00:58:20.867
our process row. There

2841
00:58:20.867 --> 00:58:21.666
we go. High severity,

2842
00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:22.585
low severity. So you

2843
00:58:22.585 --> 00:58:23.425
can imagine, you know,

2844
00:58:23.485 --> 00:58:24.364
this is a great

2845
00:58:24.385 --> 00:58:25.324
tool to use to

2846
00:58:25.324 --> 00:58:27.344
trace before an error

2847
00:58:27.364 --> 00:58:29.043
happened in your workflow.

2848
00:58:29.182 --> 00:58:30.543
Very importantly, you can
