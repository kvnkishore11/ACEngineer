454
00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.772
of the conversation because

455
00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:31.870
we're using the Claude

456
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.850
SDK client and because

457
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.489
we've written multiple query

458
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:36.349
calls. You can see

459
00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:37.369
we have two here,

460
00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:38.528
follow up prompt and

461
00:10:38.528 --> 00:10:40.246
the original user prompt,

462
00:10:40.427 --> 00:10:40.966
all right? So we

463
00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:42.025
have both the tool

464
00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:42.745
use block that we

465
00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:43.784
care about and we

466
00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:45.184
have the text block.

467
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:46.403
You can stream all

468
00:10:46.403 --> 00:10:47.443
the messages coming back

469
00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:48.062
out from your agent

470
00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:49.383
after you query and

471
00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:50.342
just take them in,

472
00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:51.101
right? Take them in,

473
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:51.802
do whatever you want

474
00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:52.381
with them. Here, of

475
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:53.620
course, we're just logging

476
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.519
with clean, rich panels,

477
00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:57.698
concisely communicating what's happening

478
00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:58.578
with our agent. If

479
00:10:58.578 --> 00:10:59.198
you don't know what

480
00:10:59.198 --> 00:10:59.937
your agent is doing,

481
00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:00.798
if you don't adopt
