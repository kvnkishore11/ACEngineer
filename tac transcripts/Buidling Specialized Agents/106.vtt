WEBVTT

2565
00:52:59.478 --> 00:53:01.097
so many multi-agent configurations

2566
00:53:01.097 --> 00:53:02.335
that are untapped and

2567
00:53:02.335 --> 00:53:03.635
unexplored. So this is

2568
00:53:03.635 --> 00:53:04.375
all under a single

2569
00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:06.150
file, which is probably

2570
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:07.289
not correct since we're

2571
00:53:07.289 --> 00:53:08.369
up at 1,400. So

2572
00:53:08.369 --> 00:53:08.728
this is gonna be

2573
00:53:08.728 --> 00:53:09.887
harder for an agent

2574
00:53:09.907 --> 00:53:10.568
to read, but you

2575
00:53:10.568 --> 00:53:11.447
can see here, not

2576
00:53:11.467 --> 00:53:12.168
too bad either, right?

2577
00:53:12.168 --> 00:53:13.367
We have concrete headers.

2578
00:53:13.367 --> 00:53:14.086
That'll be a little

2579
00:53:14.086 --> 00:53:14.927
bit easier to understand

2580
00:53:14.927 --> 00:53:15.766
and read if we

2581
00:53:15.766 --> 00:53:17.365
need to quickly filter

2582
00:53:17.385 --> 00:53:18.364
through and search through

2583
00:53:18.364 --> 00:53:20.284
what exactly the application

2584
00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:21.244
is doing. But anyway,

2585
00:53:21.244 --> 00:53:21.864
we can of course

2586
00:53:21.884 --> 00:53:23.423
search at tool to

2587
00:53:23.423 --> 00:53:23.922
find all of our

2588
00:53:23.922 --> 00:53:25.402
tools. And more importantly,

2589
00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.961
we can search for

2590
00:53:26.961 --> 00:53:29.101
Claude Code options. We

2591
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.121
have custom agents, right?
