2369
00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.085
do whatever it needs

2370
00:49:00.085 --> 00:49:00.885
to, to ship. And

2371
00:49:00.925 --> 00:49:01.485
of course we have

2372
00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:02.724
the resume ID here.

2373
00:49:02.724 --> 00:49:03.103
We don't need it

2374
00:49:03.103 --> 00:49:04.043
because we're just firing

2375
00:49:04.043 --> 00:49:05.474
off one agent, one

2376
00:49:05.474 --> 00:49:06.873
prompt, one purpose. But

2377
00:49:06.873 --> 00:49:07.432
if we needed to,

2378
00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:08.313
we could resume the

2379
00:49:08.313 --> 00:49:10.391
conversation for user interface

2380
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:11.931
purposes, right? Although with

2381
00:49:11.931 --> 00:49:13.650
these larger building and

2382
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:14.989
planning steps, you don't

2383
00:49:14.989 --> 00:49:16.789
want your custom agents

2384
00:49:16.967 --> 00:49:18.527
running the compat command

2385
00:49:18.768 --> 00:49:19.927
behind your back because

2386
00:49:19.927 --> 00:49:20.867
the context got too

2387
00:49:20.867 --> 00:49:22.106
large. That will create

2388
00:49:22.146 --> 00:49:23.525
outcomes that are much

2389
00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:25.085
harder to trace. Hence

2390
00:49:25.085 --> 00:49:26.463
the big idea, one

2391
00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.643
agent, one prompt, one

2392
00:49:27.643 --> 00:49:28.963
purpose. And our reviewer

2393
00:49:28.963 --> 00:49:30.302
is doing something interesting.
