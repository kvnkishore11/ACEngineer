305
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.610
each element flows and

306
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.970
controls your agent, you

307
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.809
will understand compute and

308
00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:34.369
you'll understand how to

309
00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:35.687
scale your compute. Let's

310
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:36.228
go ahead and echo

311
00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:37.326
ourselves. So I'm gonna

312
00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:38.766
say echo this string

313
00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:39.625
and then I want

314
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.745
it in reverse in

315
00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:42.925
uppercase. Repeat two times.

316
00:07:42.964 --> 00:07:44.043
Here we're just playing

317
00:07:44.043 --> 00:07:45.084
with the tool that

318
00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:46.862
our custom agent has.

319
00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:47.463
All right, so there's

320
00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:48.422
the user prompt, there's

321
00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:49.920
that call. In reverse,

322
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.701
this text comes out

323
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:51.701
to custom agents are

324
00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:52.759
powerful. We ask it

325
00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:53.639
to repeat. repeat and

326
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.278
go uppercase. So that's

327
00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:56.418
exactly what our agent

328
00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:57.718
has done. Okay. We're

329
00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:58.677
scaling up a little

330
00:07:58.677 --> 00:07:59.476
more. We're adding a

331
00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:00.877
few more capabilities to
