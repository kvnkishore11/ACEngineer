2718
00:55:59.478 --> 00:56:00.559
window by updating the

2719
00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:01.679
session ID. We have

2720
00:56:01.679 --> 00:56:02.557
lines to read and

2721
00:56:02.557 --> 00:56:04.097
then once again, rinse

2722
00:56:04.097 --> 00:56:05.157
and repeat, right? Whatever

2723
00:56:05.157 --> 00:56:05.777
you want your agent

2724
00:56:05.797 --> 00:56:07.217
to do, detail it

2725
00:56:07.217 --> 00:56:09.336
in the specific agentic

2726
00:56:09.336 --> 00:56:10.596
prompt format, the agentic

2727
00:56:10.596 --> 00:56:12.615
system prompt format. Specifically,

2728
00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:13.255
we have the workflow,

2729
00:56:13.255 --> 00:56:14.454
we have instructions, variables,

2730
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:15.494
purpose. You can imagine

2731
00:56:15.494 --> 00:56:16.454
what this all does.

2732
00:56:16.454 --> 00:56:17.393
The workflow is important

2733
00:56:17.393 --> 00:56:18.434
here because again, we

2734
00:56:18.434 --> 00:56:19.994
have a specific workflow.

2735
00:56:19.994 --> 00:56:20.733
We want our agent

2736
00:56:20.753 --> 00:56:22.052
to hit every single

2737
00:56:22.052 --> 00:56:23.032
time. We're giving it

2738
00:56:23.032 --> 00:56:24.632
some examples, right? This

2739
00:56:24.632 --> 00:56:26.132
is an important section

2740
00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:26.771
that you can swap

2741
00:56:26.831 --> 00:56:28.590
into your agentic prompts,

2742
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:29.331
both system prompt and

2743
00:56:29.331 --> 00:56:30.030
user prompt. And we're
