689
00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:30.192
right? So user prompt

690
00:15:30.192 --> 00:15:31.212
came in, we called

691
00:15:31.212 --> 00:15:32.072
the tool right away

692
00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:33.072
and the agent has

693
00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:34.091
responded to us, right?

694
00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:35.412
Two decimal places, looks

695
00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:38.051
great. 125 meters to

696
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:39.951
millimeters. Again, using that

697
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.889
custom converter there, it's

698
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:41.830
being very concise with

699
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.090
its response. It's just

700
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.028
giving me the answer

701
00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:45.129
I'm looking for, right?

702
00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:47.188
A fine-tuned calculator agent.

703
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:48.947
I know, still simple,

704
00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:49.868
but we're working working

705
00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:51.567
up to more complexity,

706
00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:52.346
stacking it on. I

707
00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:53.667
want you to understand

708
00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.826
the primitives. Primitive understanding

709
00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:57.546
is critical for scaling

710
00:15:57.546 --> 00:15:58.046
up what you can

711
00:15:58.046 --> 00:15:59.125
do. Don't start with

712
00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:00.245
big things, start with
