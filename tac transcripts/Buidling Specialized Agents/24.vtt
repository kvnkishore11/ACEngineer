528
00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.201
tools, 15 extra options

529
00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:01.062
that our agent has

530
00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:02.321
to choose from and

531
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.519
select to do the

532
00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.658
job we've asked it.

533
00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:06.077
Now our Echo agent,

534
00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:07.201
does not need any

535
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:08.140
of these tools. All

536
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.640
right. And so as

537
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.799
we progress, we're going

538
00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:10.399
to find to and

539
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:10.840
we're going to get

540
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.519
more control over our

541
00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.457
agent. If you ever

542
00:12:13.457 --> 00:12:14.638
run the slash context

543
00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:16.517
commander, understand what's going

544
00:12:16.517 --> 00:12:17.277
into your agent. You

545
00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:18.615
know that these 15

546
00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:21.235
tools consumes context. It

547
00:12:21.235 --> 00:12:22.933
consumes space in your

548
00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:24.013
agent's mind. We're going

549
00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:24.533
to learn how to

550
00:12:24.533 --> 00:12:25.572
control that knob in

551
00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:26.532
our next agent. The

552
00:12:26.532 --> 00:12:27.152
last thing we want

553
00:12:27.172 --> 00:12:27.812
to point out here

554
00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:29.250
is our echo system

555
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.909
prompt. Okay. Very simple.
