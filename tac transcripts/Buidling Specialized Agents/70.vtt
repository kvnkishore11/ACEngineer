1660
00:34:59.041 --> 00:35:01.099
tools, custom agents, Let

1661
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.099
you control all of

1662
00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:03.478
these very quickly and

1663
00:35:03.478 --> 00:35:05.157
quickly. consistently, right? This

1664
00:35:05.157 --> 00:35:06.237
is encoded, right? This

1665
00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:07.476
is quite literally in

1666
00:35:07.476 --> 00:35:08.456
code. So our agent

1667
00:35:08.456 --> 00:35:09.775
will always perform this

1668
00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:10.894
way. That's our allowed

1669
00:35:10.894 --> 00:35:12.173
tools, disallowed tools. And

1670
00:35:12.173 --> 00:35:12.793
then we have something

1671
00:35:12.793 --> 00:35:13.713
special here. We have

1672
00:35:13.773 --> 00:35:14.893
hooks. If you've used

1673
00:35:14.893 --> 00:35:15.692
Claude Code hooks, you

1674
00:35:15.692 --> 00:35:16.612
know exactly what this

1675
00:35:16.632 --> 00:35:17.431
is. This is how

1676
00:35:17.431 --> 00:35:18.190
we can tap into

1677
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.811
the permission system. So

1678
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:21.309
we're blocking environment variable

1679
00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:22.389
files. We have two

1680
00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:24.027
matches here, pre-tool use,

1681
00:35:24.068 --> 00:35:25.047
post-tool use. Here we're

1682
00:35:25.047 --> 00:35:26.068
just doing some logging,

1683
00:35:26.068 --> 00:35:27.407
right? Log tool usage.

1684
00:35:27.407 --> 00:35:28.367
We're just calling this

1685
00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:29.525
method. That's what these

1686
00:35:29.525 --> 00:35:30.465
do. These just point
