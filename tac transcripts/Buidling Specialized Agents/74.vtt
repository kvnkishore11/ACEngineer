1759
00:36:59.277 --> 00:37:00.358
fired up here and

1760
00:37:00.358 --> 00:37:00.677
let me just go

1761
00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:01.416
ahead and clear this

1762
00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:02.657
out and restart this.

1763
00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:03.456
And we have our

1764
00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:04.076
backend, we have our

1765
00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:04.976
frontend. Let's go ahead

1766
00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:06.514
and understand what this

1767
00:37:06.514 --> 00:37:07.753
interface is, all right?

1768
00:37:07.954 --> 00:37:08.373
So this is a

1769
00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:09.514
try copy writer. We're

1770
00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:10.632
now moving our agents

1771
00:37:10.632 --> 00:37:12.452
into user interfaces. So

1772
00:37:12.711 --> 00:37:13.311
I'll just start by

1773
00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:14.090
typing hi and you

1774
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.451
can see something interesting

1775
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:15.710
right out of the

1776
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.190
box. We have one

1777
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.648
agent generating a response

1778
00:37:18.648 --> 00:37:22.728
with six variations. multi-variation

1779
00:37:22.788 --> 00:37:24.507
copywriter agent. I have

1780
00:37:24.507 --> 00:37:25.746
with one prompt, six

1781
00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:26.887
variations coming out of

1782
00:37:26.887 --> 00:37:27.646
this agent. All right,

1783
00:37:27.646 --> 00:37:28.525
very powerful, but it's

1784
00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:29.565
even more capable than

1785
00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:30.606
that. Okay, I can
