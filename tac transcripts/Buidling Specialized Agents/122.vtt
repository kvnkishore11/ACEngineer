2977
01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:01.635
massive mistake. They own

2978
01:01:01.675 --> 01:01:02.695
Agentic Coding. They are

2979
01:01:02.695 --> 01:01:04.175
the best at this.

2980
01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:06.295
And despite efforts from

2981
01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:07.074
some of the other

2982
01:01:07.074 --> 01:01:08.293
Gen AI companies, I

2983
01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:09.094
don't see that changing

2984
01:01:09.094 --> 01:01:10.518
anytime soon. and I

2985
01:01:10.518 --> 01:01:12.034
use all those tools

2986
01:01:12.034 --> 01:01:12.653
and I've been using

2987
01:01:12.653 --> 01:01:13.771
Claude Code since the

2988
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.168
beginning, okay? So don't

2989
01:01:15.188 --> 01:01:16.846
try to reproduce your

2990
01:01:16.846 --> 01:01:18.023
own engineering agent. Cloud

2991
01:01:18.023 --> 01:01:19.780
Code is that, okay?

2992
01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.139
And this space is

2993
01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:23.476
just, Totally, totally oversaturated.

2994
01:01:23.476 --> 01:01:24.597
So when you're operating

2995
01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:25.416
in the loop, prompting

2996
01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:26.335
back and forth, use

2997
01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:27.255
Claude Code. Use the

2998
01:01:27.275 --> 01:01:28.715
out-of-the-box agent. When else

2999
01:01:28.715 --> 01:01:29.853
should you use out-of-the-box

3000
01:01:29.873 --> 01:01:30.914
agents? When your workflow
