2797
00:57:29.434 --> 00:57:30.773
the primitives that you

2798
00:57:30.773 --> 00:57:31.954
can tweak and tune.

2799
00:57:32.014 --> 00:57:32.653
One of the most

2800
00:57:32.653 --> 00:57:34.293
important compositions is of

2801
00:57:34.293 --> 00:57:36.112
course the agent and

2802
00:57:36.112 --> 00:57:37.532
then its underlying primitives,

2803
00:57:37.532 --> 00:57:38.672
12 leverage points of

2804
00:57:38.672 --> 00:57:40.630
agent Agentic, specifically the

2805
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:42.050
core four context model

2806
00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:43.150
prompt tools. You can

2807
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.010
now control all of

2808
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:45.170
it better than ever.

2809
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.909
This codebase is

2810
00:57:45.909 --> 00:57:46.489
gonna help you get

2811
00:57:46.489 --> 00:57:47.349
started by the way.

2812
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:48.648
Hop in here, use

2813
00:57:48.648 --> 00:57:49.648
any one of these,

2814
00:57:49.668 --> 00:57:50.369
push them up against

2815
00:57:50.369 --> 00:57:51.568
their limits, break them,

2816
00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:52.628
right? These aren't perfect.

2817
00:57:52.688 --> 00:57:53.248
These are meant to

2818
00:57:53.248 --> 00:57:54.186
show you you can

2819
00:57:54.186 --> 00:57:55.601
use agents to solve

2820
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:58.237
your domain specific This

2821
00:57:58.237 --> 00:57:59.516
is our inspect agent

2822
00:57:59.556 --> 00:58:00.695
and we have find
