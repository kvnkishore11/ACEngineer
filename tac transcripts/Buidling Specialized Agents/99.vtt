WEBVTT

2393
00:49:28.963 --> 00:49:30.302
is doing something interesting.

2394
00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:31.601
It's appending its system

2395
00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.800
prompt to the clawed

2396
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.460
code system, okay? So

2397
00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.280
we're not blowing it

2398
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280
away We're just adding

2399
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.259
something, all right? I'm

2400
00:49:37.259 --> 00:49:38.219
gonna leave this all

2401
00:49:38.219 --> 00:49:39.278
here for you to

2402
00:49:39.278 --> 00:49:40.039
check out and to

2403
00:49:40.039 --> 00:49:41.418
understand. We have a

2404
00:49:41.597 --> 00:49:43.898
multi-agent workflow wrapped in

2405
00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:44.936
a UI. We are

2406
00:49:44.936 --> 00:49:46.456
extending Claude Code in

2407
00:49:46.456 --> 00:49:47.936
most cases, modifying a

2408
00:49:47.936 --> 00:49:48.735
couple things, adding some

2409
00:49:48.735 --> 00:49:50.255
permission checks, some hooks.

2410
00:49:50.275 --> 00:49:51.235
In our planner agent

2411
00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:52.934
and in our review

2412
00:49:52.934 --> 00:49:54.094
agent, we're just appending

2413
00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:55.195
system prompt. So this

2414
00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:55.934
is an important idea.

2415
00:49:55.934 --> 00:49:57.233
You don't always need

2416
00:49:57.233 --> 00:49:58.393
to blow away the

2417
00:49:58.393 --> 00:49:59.893
Claude Code system prompt,

2418
00:49:59.932 --> 00:50:00.592
all right? So very
