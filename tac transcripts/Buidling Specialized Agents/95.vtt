2295
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:30.130
have a full plan.

2296
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.869
We have a trail

2297
00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:32.061
of success. in our

2298
00:47:32.061 --> 00:47:33.320
codebase from planning

2299
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.641
to building to reviewing.

2300
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.539
We also have in

2301
00:47:35.539 --> 00:47:37.318
this micro SDLC a

2302
00:47:37.318 --> 00:47:39.159
review file here as

2303
00:47:39.159 --> 00:47:40.177
well. So our agent

2304
00:47:40.177 --> 00:47:41.338
not only planned, it

2305
00:47:41.338 --> 00:47:42.396
wrote a review for

2306
00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:42.976
us as well. So

2307
00:47:42.996 --> 00:47:44.496
that's fantastic. And let's

2308
00:47:44.496 --> 00:47:45.456
get back to our,

2309
00:47:45.456 --> 00:47:46.014
where did that go?

2310
00:47:46.014 --> 00:47:47.255
Agent orchestration, right? So

is one of our

2315
00:47:51.353 --> 00:47:52.911
agents configurations. We can

2316
00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:53.751
of course go into

2317
00:47:53.751 --> 00:47:55.351
our planner prompt and

2318
00:47:55.351 --> 00:47:56.489
see exactly what our

2319
00:47:56.489 --> 00:47:57.809
planner is doing. There's

2320
00:47:57.809 --> 00:47:58.949
