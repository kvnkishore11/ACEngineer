1738
00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.054
here, this is essential

1739
00:36:31.054 --> 00:36:32.432
for governance, for control,

1740
00:36:32.432 --> 00:36:33.992
for permissions in all

1741
00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:34.831
of your agents. We

1742
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:36.012
can ask questions, we

1743
00:36:36.012 --> 00:36:36.951
can let it search.

1744
00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:38.070
It runs multiple agents

1745
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.690
to get things done

1746
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:39.610
quickly. Feel free to

1747
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.130
use this as a

1748
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.429
starting point for your

1749
00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:42.849
own code-based QA agent.

1750
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:43.887
Let's move on to

1751
00:36:43.887 --> 00:36:45.447
richer applications where we

1752
00:36:45.447 --> 00:36:47.306
embed our agents into

1753
00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:51.661
user experiences. Next we

1754
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:53.900
have a try copy

1755
00:36:53.981 --> 00:36:55.139
writer. And now we

1756
00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:56.280
have a more built

1757
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.059
out structure, backend, frontend,

1758
00:36:58.059 --> 00:36:59.277
prompts. We have this

1759
00:36:59.277 --> 00:37:00.358
fired up here and
