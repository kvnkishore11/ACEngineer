00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:00.846
terminal interface. This agent

1422
00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:02.664
is a specialized agent.

1423
00:30:02.664 --> 00:30:04.263
It is veering into

1424
00:30:04.263 --> 00:30:06.083
that advanced context engineering

1425
00:30:06.202 --> 00:30:08.082
capability. This agent is

1426
00:30:08.142 --> 00:30:09.221
an expert. Check out

1427
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:10.579
the elite context engineering

1428
00:30:10.579 --> 00:30:12.578
extended lesson to understand

1429
00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.578
agent experts at a

1430
00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:14.518
deeper level. We have

1431
00:30:14.518 --> 00:30:15.518
a simple version of

1432
00:30:15.518 --> 00:30:16.396
an agent expert here.

1433
00:30:16.396 --> 00:30:17.096
Let's break it down.

1434
00:30:17.096 --> 00:30:17.576
This is a code

1435
00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:18.776
base question and answer

1436
00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:19.395
system. So you can

1437
00:30:19.395 --> 00:30:20.615
imagine this being useful

1438
00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:21.933
for, of course, understanding

1439
00:30:21.933 --> 00:30:22.913
the codebase for

1440
00:30:22.913 --> 00:30:24.113
getting new engineers ramped

1441
00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:25.811
up for performing engineers,

1442
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:26.991
just understanding how to

1443
00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:27.651
build out a new

1444
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:29.329
feature. So list all

1445
00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:30.929
your tools. from your
