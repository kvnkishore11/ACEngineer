3149
01:04:29.815 --> 01:04:30.936
own agent SDK. These

3150
01:04:30.936 --> 01:04:32.855
are all powerful toolkits

3151
01:04:32.855 --> 01:04:33.813
you can use to

3152
01:04:33.813 --> 01:04:35.893
control the core for

3153
01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:37.353
within your agents to

3154
01:04:37.353 --> 01:04:39.311
scale them intelligently. If

3155
01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:40.371
you're doing one size

3156
01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:41.990
fits all work, use

3157
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:42.411
the out of the

3158
01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.911
box agent. Don't think

3159
01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:44.751
super hard about this.

3160
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:46.110
Just deploy compute to

3161
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:46.949
get the job done.

3162
01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:47.590
But as your work

3163
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:49.090
becomes more specialized, as

3164
01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.809
you deploy agents across

3165
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:51.708
all aspects of your

3166
01:04:51.708 --> 01:04:52.969
engineering, you first want

3167
01:04:53.009 --> 01:04:54.648
better agents, more agents,

3168
01:04:54.748 --> 01:04:56.588
and then custom agents.

3169
01:04:56.728 --> 01:04:57.268
So one of the

3170
01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.786
benefits rolled into the

3171
01:04:58.806 --> 01:05:01.327
agentic horizon extended lesson
