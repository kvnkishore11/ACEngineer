2188
00:45:29.485 --> 00:45:30.724
using it since Claude

2189
00:45:30.724 --> 00:45:31.844
Code was released. You

2190
00:45:31.844 --> 00:45:32.443
can see here, we

2191
00:45:32.443 --> 00:45:33.983
just moved to shipped.

2192
00:45:33.983 --> 00:45:35.262
There we go, update

2193
00:45:35.282 --> 00:45:35.981
titles. And you can

2194
00:45:35.981 --> 00:45:36.681
see here, guess what

2195
00:45:36.681 --> 00:45:38.260
happened? Plan, build, review,

2196
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.581
and ship agents. Both

2197
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:40.800
titles updated. This work

2198
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.018
shipped with a single

2199
00:45:42.018 --> 00:45:43.858
prompt outside the loop,

2200
00:45:43.858 --> 00:45:44.318
right? This is a

2201
00:45:44.318 --> 00:45:46.016
perfect example of an

2202
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:48.175
out loop review system

2203
00:45:48.255 --> 00:45:49.735
using the Peter framework,

2204
00:45:49.735 --> 00:45:51.135
right? Our tickets are

2205
00:45:51.135 --> 00:45:53.054
our prompt input and

2206
00:45:53.173 --> 00:45:54.851
review system. We dialed

2207
00:45:54.851 --> 00:45:56.130
into this a ton

2208
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.268
inside of TAC. If

2209
00:45:57.268 --> 00:45:58.027
you haven't finished the

2210
00:45:58.027 --> 00:45:59.385
TAC lessons, you should

2211
00:45:59.385 --> 00:46:00.503
probably stop watching this
