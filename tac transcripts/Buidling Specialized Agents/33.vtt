500K at 5% interest,

738
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:33.158
okay? Again, just showcasing

739
00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.298
a simple example in

740
00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:36.317
agent, fine-tuned, customized to

741
00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:37.716
do one thing very

742
00:16:37.716 --> 00:16:39.115
well. Let's break down

743
00:16:39.115 --> 00:16:39.995
this agent, all right?

744
00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:40.875
Calc agent. You can

745
00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:41.414
see a couple things

746
00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:42.014
right away. I'm already

747
00:16:42.014 --> 00:16:42.653
at the sweet spot

748
00:16:42.653 --> 00:16:44.692
here. Cloud code options.

749
00:16:44.734 --> 00:16:45.832
We have our built-in

750
00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:47.091
MCP server with our

751
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.292
specific allowed but the

752
00:16:48.292 --> 00:16:49.970
most important part here

753
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.990
is this. At the

754
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.168
beginning we ran list

755
00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:53.607
all tools, it only

756
00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:54.907
had our two tools,

757
00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:55.806
right? We can keep

758
00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:57.625
asking, right? List available

759
00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:01.022
tools, again, function name,
