429
00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:00.657
off prompts and the

430
00:10:00.657 --> 00:10:02.456
Claude SDK client is

431
00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:04.236
for continuous conversations. Let

432
00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:04.735
me show you exactly

433
00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:05.515
what I mean here.

434
00:10:05.515 --> 00:10:06.535
Let's clear this and

435
00:10:06.535 --> 00:10:07.655
let's run this once

436
00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:09.155
again with follow up.

437
00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:09.634
So if we kick

438
00:10:09.634 --> 00:10:10.615
this off, our agent

439
00:10:10.615 --> 00:10:11.634
is going to run

440
00:10:11.634 --> 00:10:12.754
that same prompt like

441
00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:13.634
normal, but then it's

442
00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:14.774
going to continue the

443
00:10:14.774 --> 00:10:15.734
conversation. We're going to

444
00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:17.337
pass in another follow

445
00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:18.018
up prompt, I'm gonna

446
00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.756
say concisely summarize our

447
00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:21.275
conversation in bullet points.

448
00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:21.816
And so here it

449
00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:22.774
is, right? Our agent

450
00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:24.054
quickly responds, follow up

451
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:25.994
response, concise summary, one,

452
00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:28.052
two, three, four. Our

453
00:10:28.052 --> 00:10:29.292
agent has kept track

454
00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.772
of the conversation because
