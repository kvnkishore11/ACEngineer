check out the options.

1171
00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:02.404
This is our custom

1172
00:25:02.484 --> 00:25:03.344
agent that we've built

1173
00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:04.564
from scratch to be

1174
00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:06.563
a great data analysis

1175
00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:07.642

1184
00:25:19.196 --> 00:25:20.496

00:25:20.496 --> 00:25:21.576
law that you're your

1186
00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:22.815

is the purpose of

1189
00:25:26.432 --> 00:25:27.071
your agent that will

00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:28.931
