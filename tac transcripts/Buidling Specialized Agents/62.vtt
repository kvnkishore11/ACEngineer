00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.261
show in bullets, name

1470
00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:01.520
only. Check this out.

1471
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.000
We have 13 tools

1472
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.680
and you can see

1473
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.818
which tools specifically are

1474
00:31:05.818 --> 00:31:07.438
enabled for our code-based

1475
00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:09.892
QA agent. task, bash,

1476
00:31:09.912 --> 00:31:11.589
glob, grep, read, some

1477
00:31:11.589 --> 00:31:12.489
web searching and some

1478
00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:13.167
fire call searching. We

1479
00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:14.306
probably don't need both

1480
00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:15.144
of these web searching,

1481
00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:15.684
but I wanted to

1482
00:31:15.684 --> 00:31:16.903
add these as fallbacks

1483
00:31:16.903 --> 00:31:17.402
for you if you

1484
00:31:17.402 --> 00:31:17.980
come in here and

1485
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.660
you don't have the

1486
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.538
fire call MCP server

1487
00:31:19.538 --> 00:31:20.856
set up. So summarize

1488
00:31:20.856 --> 00:31:22.394
the key way agent,

1489
00:31:22.394 --> 00:31:23.829
think hard. We're gonna

1490
00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:24.969
tap in to the

1491
00:31:24.969 --> 00:31:26.608
agent's reasoning capabilities. There

1492
00:31:26.608 --> 00:31:27.288
you can see we

1493
00:31:27.288 --> 00:31:28.906
have a thinking response

1494
00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:29.946
block that we're parsing.
