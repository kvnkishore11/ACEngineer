3000
01:01:29.873 --> 01:01:30.914
agents? When your workflow

3001
01:01:30.914 --> 01:01:32.413
is generic enough that

3002
01:01:32.413 --> 01:01:34.012
the Claude Code SDK

3003
01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:34.871
can deliver on the

3004
01:01:34.871 --> 01:01:35.670
work you want done.

3005
01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:36.271
You also want to

3006
01:01:36.271 --> 01:01:37.451
use out-of-the-box agents. If

3007
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:38.570
you're just exploring your

3008
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.268
prototyping, there's no innovation

3009
01:01:40.289 --> 01:01:41.028
needed here. You don't

3010
01:01:41.028 --> 01:01:42.248
need custom agents to

3011
01:01:42.248 --> 01:01:43.467
explore and prototype. If

3012
01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:44.447
you need a balanced

3013
01:01:44.447 --> 01:01:45.847
generalist engineering agent that

3014
01:01:45.847 --> 01:01:46.806
works well in 80%

3015
01:01:46.826 --> 01:01:48.385
of situations, use the

3016
01:01:48.385 --> 01:01:49.605
out-of-the-box Claude Code agent.

3017
01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:50.385
When your tasks are

3018
01:01:50.385 --> 01:01:52.003
short-lived, lightweight, They don't

3019
01:01:52.003 --> 01:01:53.943
require repeatability and they're

3020
01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.702
not domain specific. It

3021
01:01:55.702 --> 01:01:57.063
doesn't matter what agent

3022
01:01:57.063 --> 01:01:58.322
you use. Okay. You

3023
01:01:58.322 --> 01:01:59.222
don't need a custom

3024
01:01:59.222 --> 01:02:00.242
agent for this. You
