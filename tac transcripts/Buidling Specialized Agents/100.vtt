2418
00:49:59.932 --> 00:50:00.592
all right? So very

2419
00:50:00.592 --> 00:50:02.072
powerful. This is of

2420
00:50:02.072 --> 00:50:02.833
course a demo. This

2421
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.452
isn't gonna work in

2422
00:50:03.452 --> 00:50:04.251
all cases, but you

2423
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.391
have this available. to

2424
00:50:05.391 --> 00:50:06.271
you to test out,

2425
00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:07.550
to understand how you

2426
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:08.309
could build something like

2427
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:09.429
this. Let's move on

2428
00:50:09.429 --> 00:50:10.927
to our final agent,

2429
00:50:11.047 --> 00:50:15.364
the UltraStream agent. Our

2430
00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:17.003
final agent looks like

2431
00:50:17.083 --> 00:50:19.262
this. Similar structure, backend,

2432
00:50:19.445 --> 00:50:20.985
data front end modules,

2433
00:50:20.985 --> 00:50:22.324
system prompts, and we

2434
00:50:22.324 --> 00:50:22.804
have a couple of

2435
00:50:22.804 --> 00:50:23.423
test files. We have

2436
00:50:23.423 --> 00:50:24.802
some data here. Let's

2437
00:50:24.842 --> 00:50:26.981
understand this server, kick

2438
00:50:26.981 --> 00:50:28.302
off the backend. Once

2439
00:50:28.302 --> 00:50:28.882
again, I'm gonna run

2440
00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:30.181
with reset so that
