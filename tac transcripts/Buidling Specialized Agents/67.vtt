1586
00:33:28.785 --> 00:33:31.003
functionality, leveraging parallel search,

1587
00:33:31.044 --> 00:33:33.042
capabilities, intelligent analysis, right?

1588
00:33:33.042 --> 00:33:34.282
So instructions, you can

1589
00:33:34.282 --> 00:33:34.962
see a whole set

1590
00:33:34.962 --> 00:33:35.862
of instructions here. Let's

1591
00:33:35.862 --> 00:33:36.501
go ahead and collapse

1592
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:36.942
this to the third

1593
00:33:36.942 --> 00:33:38.580
level. Three sections of

1594
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.779
instructions. We have our

1595
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:41.259
current working directory with

1596
00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:42.638
some information about this

1597
00:33:42.638 --> 00:33:43.499
codebase the agent's

1598
00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:44.097
operating in. And then

1599
00:33:44.097 --> 00:33:45.897
we have agent examples.

1600
00:33:45.938 --> 00:33:46.616
All right, so agent

1601
00:33:46.616 --> 00:33:48.395
examples are powerful for

1602
00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:49.096
letting your agent know

1603
00:33:49.096 --> 00:33:50.815
exactly how to respond,

1604
00:33:50.815 --> 00:33:51.134
right? So you can

1605
00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:52.534
see this is just

1606
00:33:52.534 --> 00:33:53.554
a couple back and

1607
00:33:53.554 --> 00:33:56.093
forth question answers for

1608
00:33:56.093 --> 00:33:56.912
your agent. And this

1609
00:33:56.912 --> 00:33:57.571
is always in the

1610
00:33:57.571 --> 00:33:59.030
system your agent always

1611
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.529
knows how to respond.
