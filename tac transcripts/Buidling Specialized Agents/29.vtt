648
00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:31.491
tool names only. Okay.

649
00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:32.431
So these are the

650
00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:33.990
tools, the only tools

651
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.389
this agent has. So

652
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:37.070
in contrast, to our

653
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.649
Echo agent, our calculator

654
00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:40.369
agent only has these

655
00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:41.967
two tools, okay? This

656
00:14:41.967 --> 00:14:44.207
is a fine-grained focused

657
00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:45.787
agent. Very clearly you

658
00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:46.267
can see we have

659
00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:47.966
a different agent experience,

660
00:14:47.966 --> 00:14:48.706
we have a different

661
00:14:48.706 --> 00:14:51.129
agent interface. Okay. Before

662
00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:52.249
we were running scripts

663
00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:53.368
throughout tack, we ran

664
00:14:53.467 --> 00:14:54.567
80 W's, which are

665
00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:56.386
scripts in our new

666
00:14:56.386 --> 00:14:58.005
agentic layer. That's great

667
00:14:58.005 --> 00:14:59.465
for true engineering workflows.

668
00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.423
Most agents for engineers
