2770
00:56:59.567 --> 00:57:00.186
like we ran into

2771
00:57:00.186 --> 00:57:00.706
some issue. Let's go

2772
00:57:00.706 --> 00:57:01.327
ahead and restart the

2773
00:57:01.327 --> 00:57:02.365
server. We can also

2774
00:57:02.365 --> 00:57:03.385
find logs for a

2775
00:57:03.385 --> 00:57:05.065
specific user based on

2776
00:57:05.065 --> 00:57:06.143
the information that we're

2777
00:57:06.143 --> 00:57:07.443
processing based on our,

2778
00:57:07.583 --> 00:57:10.101
again, domain specific problem.

2779
00:57:10.222 --> 00:57:11.362
I really wanna showcase

2780
00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:11.981
that that is the

2781
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:13.280
key of custom agents.

2782
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.380
You can solve your

2783
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.300
problems better than any

2784
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.679
agent can. Okay, out

2785
00:57:17.679 --> 00:57:18.557
of the box is

2786
00:57:18.557 --> 00:57:19.237
a great place to

2787
00:57:19.237 --> 00:57:20.617
start, but don't end

2788
00:57:20.617 --> 00:57:21.577
there. There's too much

2789
00:57:21.577 --> 00:57:22.617
debate on what the

2790
00:57:22.697 --> 00:57:24.016
best tools are There's

2791
00:57:24.016 --> 00:57:24.556
too much debate on

2792
00:57:24.556 --> 00:57:25.574
the best models. This

2793
00:57:25.574 --> 00:57:26.594
is all a journey.

2794
00:57:26.594 --> 00:57:27.335
New things are coming

2795
00:57:27.355 --> 00:57:28.494
out all the time.

2796
00:57:28.494 --> 00:57:29.434
It's about focusing on

2797
00:57:29.434 --> 00:57:30.773
the primitives that you
