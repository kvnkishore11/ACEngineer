186
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.576
Pong agent, always respond

187
00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.196
exactly with Pong. That's

188
00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:04.136
it. The system prompt

189
00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:05.514
is the most important

190
00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:06.874
element of your custom

191
00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:09.317
agents. with zero exceptions.

192
00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:10.096
We are modifying the

193
00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:12.495
core for specifically the

194
00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:13.595
prompt. But now we

195
00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:15.394
have two very important

196
00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:16.392
prompts to pay attention

197
00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:17.711
to, system prompts and

198
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.151
user prompts. The system

199
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.329
prompt affects every single

200
00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.982
user prompt the agent

201
00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:24.680
runs every single one.

202
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:25.440
So all of your

203
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.540
work is multiplied by

204
00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.978
your system prompt. So

205
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:29.598
how does the Cloud

206
00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:30.598
Code SDK work? Let's
