2132
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:30.306
this is really cool,

2133
00:44:30.306 --> 00:44:31.266
right? Our build agent

2134
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.047
is now processing. So

2135
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:32.985
the planner is done.

2136
00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:34.605
You'll notice the UI

2137
00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:34.945
is gonna be a

2138
00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:35.905
little kind of glitchy

2139
00:44:35.905 --> 00:44:37.043
here because it is

2140
00:44:37.043 --> 00:44:38.643
updating on itself. And

2141
00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:39.983
so it's actively starting

2142
00:44:39.983 --> 00:44:41.081
and restarting the server

2143
00:44:41.081 --> 00:44:42.141
and the client, but

2144
00:44:42.141 --> 00:44:42.922
that's fine. Our web

2145
00:44:42.922 --> 00:44:43.880
socket should pick this

2146
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.021
up and continue processing.

2147
00:44:45.021 --> 00:44:45.780
So there you can

2148
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.659
see the spec. We're

2149
00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:48.398
operating on that plan.

2150
00:44:48.478 --> 00:44:49.039
We're operating in the

2151
00:44:49.039 --> 00:44:50.318
review now. So if

2152
00:44:50.318 --> 00:44:51.438
I hit refresh, there

2153
00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:51.956
we go. We can

2154
00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:52.556
see that we're in

2155
00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:53.795
the review step now.

2156
00:44:53.795 --> 00:44:55.596
Okay, so. Very cool

2157
00:44:55.596 --> 00:44:56.195
way to just kind

2158
00:44:56.195 --> 00:44:57.195
of see how agents

2159
00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:58.494
can work together and

2160
00:44:58.494 --> 00:44:59.414
then you just package

2161
00:44:59.414 --> 00:44:59.894
it in a nice

2162
00:44:59.894 --> 00:45:01.233
UI. Then you can
