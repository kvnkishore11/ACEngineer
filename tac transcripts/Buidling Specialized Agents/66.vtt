1563
00:32:58.702 --> 00:33:00.423
patterns, keep using them

1564
00:33:00.502 --> 00:33:01.823
collapse. And you can

1565
00:33:01.823 --> 00:33:02.281
see we have a

1566
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:03.461
nice codebase architecture

1567
00:33:03.461 --> 00:33:04.422
here. We are using

1568
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:07.020
two against slightly controversial

1569
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.101
sections. They're not really

1570
00:33:08.101 --> 00:33:09.460
that controversial, but your

1571
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.599
system prompt will just

1572
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.019
always be this way,

1573
00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:13.298
right? For every agent

1574
00:33:13.298 --> 00:33:14.179
execution. So you need

1575
00:33:14.179 --> 00:33:16.019
to be absolutely sure

1576
00:33:16.058 --> 00:33:16.798
this is what you

1577
00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:18.157
want your agent to

1578
00:33:18.157 --> 00:33:19.250
see every time it

1579
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.108
runs, right? This is

1580
00:33:20.108 --> 00:33:21.128
the law for your

1581
00:33:21.128 --> 00:33:22.667
agent. Your system prompt

1582
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.768
is the law for

1583
00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.007
your agent. Let's understand

1584
00:33:25.007 --> 00:33:26.406
the purpose of this

1585
00:33:26.406 --> 00:33:28.785
agent, understand answer questions,

1586
00:33:28.785 --> 00:33:31.003
functionality, leveraging parallel search,
