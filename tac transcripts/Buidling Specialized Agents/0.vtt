Agentic engineering leads every

engineer down one single

00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:18.393
path. Better agents, more

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.992
agents, and then custom

5
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.132
agents. If you can

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:24.050
prompt engineer and context

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.768
engineer a single agent

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:27.187
successfully, then the next

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.068
step is to add

more agents. Scale your
