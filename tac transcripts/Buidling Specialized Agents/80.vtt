1905
00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:00.101
number of versions, unique

1906
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:00.800
versions. There you go.

1907
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.659
It started with three

1908
00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:02.219
and then I bumped

1909
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:02.800
it up to number

1910
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.418
of versions. You can

1911
00:40:03.418 --> 00:40:05.326
dynamically select how many

1912
00:40:05.326 --> 00:40:06.646
versions your agent responds

1913
00:40:06.646 --> 00:40:07.565
with, all right? Number

1914
00:40:07.565 --> 00:40:08.684
of versions, we pass

1915
00:40:08.684 --> 00:40:09.425
this into the system

1916
00:40:09.425 --> 00:40:10.525
prompt and lock it

1917
00:40:10.525 --> 00:40:11.724
into stone, right? We

1918
00:40:11.724 --> 00:40:12.423
turn it into the

1919
00:40:12.423 --> 00:40:13.744
law of the agent,

1920
00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:14.423
okay? Then we have

1921
00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:16.543
our instructions, respond JSON,

1922
00:40:16.543 --> 00:40:17.523
variations, blah, blah, blah.

1923
00:40:17.523 --> 00:40:18.362
The most important part

1924
00:40:18.362 --> 00:40:19.103
is down here, right?

1925
00:40:19.382 --> 00:40:20.661
Examples, here's what the

1926
00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:21.822
output structure looks like.

1927
00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:22.702
We have the primary

1928
00:40:22.702 --> 00:40:24.101
response and we have

1929
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:26.880
our multi-version copy responses.

1930
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.599
Okay. And so it

1931
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.858
is important from a,

1932
00:40:28.878 --> 00:40:30.038
you know, prompt engineering
