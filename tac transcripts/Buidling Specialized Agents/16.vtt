331
00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:00.877
few more capabilities to

332
00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:01.956
our agent as we

333
00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:03.735
explore custom agents. Let's

334
00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:04.735
understand what's going on

335
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:05.714
here in the echo

336
00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:06.994
agent, same structure. I

337
00:08:06.994 --> 00:08:08.413
always love collapsing everything.

338
00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:08.973
And you can just

339
00:08:08.973 --> 00:08:10.213
quickly understand what's going

340
00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.012
on. We have main,

341
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:11.971
we have a tool

342
00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.192
and we have our

343
00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.050
system prompt. Always look

344
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.170
for the system prompt

345
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.230
and then look for

346
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.548
the custom tools. We

347
00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:18.908
have a couple of

348
00:08:18.908 --> 00:08:20.108
parameters here. Then we

349
00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.687
have something special. So

350
00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:22.666
once again, you can

351
00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:24.206
always just search cloud

352
00:08:24.206 --> 00:08:25.545
code options. We have

353
00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:27.165
an MCP server built

354
00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.124
in this script, create

355
00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:31.002
SDK MCP server, and
