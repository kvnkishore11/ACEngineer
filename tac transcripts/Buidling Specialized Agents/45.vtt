00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:30.804
and other CLI coding

1038
00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:32.344
agents. Perfect, okay, right

1039
00:22:32.344 --> 00:22:33.084
on topic, right on

1040
00:22:33.084 --> 00:22:33.663
topic. I was a

1041
00:22:33.663 --> 00:22:34.482
little worried when I

1042
00:22:34.522 --> 00:22:35.222
ran this, you know,

1043
00:22:35.222 --> 00:22:36.663
during this lesson that

1044
00:22:36.663 --> 00:22:37.682
we get some not

1045
00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:39.481
so clean outputs here,

1046
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:40.342
but so far so

1047
00:22:40.342 --> 00:22:41.780
good. New OpenAI tech

1048
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.580
release. OpenAI partners with

1049
00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:44.780
Joni Ive on AI

1050
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.859
devices with ChatGPT for

1051
00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:48.359
2.026 launch. And I'll

1052
00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.138
just pause here for

1053
00:22:49.138 --> 00:22:50.098
now, right? So you

1054
00:22:50.098 --> 00:22:50.499
can see how the

1055
00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:51.378
system works top to

1056
00:22:51.378 --> 00:22:52.358
bottom. That was perfect.

1057
00:22:52.358 --> 00:22:52.857
We got a couple

1058
00:22:52.857 --> 00:22:54.478
runs, couple executions. and

1059
00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:55.057
we looked at some

1060
00:22:55.057 --> 00:22:57.277
5,000 messages from this

1061
00:22:57.277 --> 00:22:58.756
WebSocket firehose. All right,

1062
00:22:58.756 --> 00:22:59.336
what is our agent

1063
00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:00.174
doing? You can see
