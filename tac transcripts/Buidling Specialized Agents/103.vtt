2489
00:51:29.199 --> 00:51:30.539
some markdown here for

2490
00:51:30.539 --> 00:51:31.239
us, all right? So

2491
00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:32.577
we have the severity

2492
00:51:32.577 --> 00:51:33.777
here, a summary, and

2493
00:51:33.777 --> 00:51:35.016
then the user in

2494
00:51:35.016 --> 00:51:35.856
which it was responsible

2495
00:51:35.856 --> 00:51:36.835
for, right? Very cool,

2496
00:51:36.835 --> 00:51:38.175
very interesting, all right?

2497
00:51:38.356 --> 00:51:39.454
And so we actually

2498
00:51:39.454 --> 00:51:40.994
just missed log four,

2499
00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:43.554
so include, log four

2500
00:51:43.594 --> 00:51:45.851
and just show summary

2501
00:51:45.952 --> 00:51:47.391
user. There is our

2502
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:48.851
tool read. It's reading

2503
00:51:48.851 --> 00:51:50.409
from this data stream.

2504
00:51:50.449 --> 00:51:50.869
And there are a

2505
00:51:50.869 --> 00:51:52.409
couple really, really important

2506
00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:53.728
pieces here happening with

2507
00:51:53.728 --> 00:51:54.768
this application, right? There's

2508
00:51:54.768 --> 00:51:55.807
the severity. And then

2509
00:51:55.807 --> 00:51:56.307
we can do something

2510
00:51:56.307 --> 00:51:57.327
like this, right? We're

2511
00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.146
in this domain specific

2512
00:51:59.146 --> 00:52:00.085
application where we have
