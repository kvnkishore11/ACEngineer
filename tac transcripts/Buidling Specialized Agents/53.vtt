1239
00:26:29.635 --> 00:26:30.435
want it to look

1240
00:26:30.435 --> 00:26:31.775
for this, okay? And

1241
00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:32.734
so we can encode

1242
00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:33.554
that in the system

1243
00:26:33.554 --> 00:26:34.705
prompt This is to

1244
00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.585
be clear, a static

1245
00:26:36.644 --> 00:26:38.124
variable that is dynamically

1246
00:26:38.124 --> 00:26:39.583
updated, right? This can't

1247
00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:40.823
run multiple times. It

1248
00:26:40.823 --> 00:26:42.221
runs a single time,

1249
00:26:42.221 --> 00:26:43.582
right? This updates to

1250
00:26:43.582 --> 00:26:45.040
whatever my prompt was

1251
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040
at runtime when I

1252
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.799
kick up this agent

1253
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:47.799
and that's it, right?

1254
00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:48.538
Not to be confused

1255
00:26:48.538 --> 00:26:50.458
with true dynamic variables

1256
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:51.998
for Claude Code, you

1257
00:26:51.998 --> 00:26:52.717
would run something like

1258
00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:53.836
this, right? Dollar sign

1259
00:26:53.836 --> 00:26:54.855
argument or dollar sign

1260
00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:55.756
one, right? This is

1261
00:26:55.756 --> 00:26:57.355
a dynamic variable. Every

1262
00:26:57.355 --> 00:26:58.555
time the user prompt

1263
00:26:58.555 --> 00:26:59.354
runs, this will get

1264
00:26:59.354 --> 00:27:00.193
updated. This is not
