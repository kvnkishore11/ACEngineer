1785
00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:30.606
that. Okay, I can

1786
00:37:30.724 --> 00:37:31.485
drag and drop a

1787
00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:32.525
file and load this

1788
00:37:32.525 --> 00:37:33.985
as context. This is

1789
00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.523
the script from the

1790
00:37:35.523 --> 00:37:37.664
Elite Context Engineering extended

1791
00:37:37.664 --> 00:37:38.623
lesson. And I'll just

1792
00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:40.643
say, write a blog

1793
00:37:40.702 --> 00:37:42.181
post title for our

1794
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:44.302
script between 30 and

1795
00:37:44.302 --> 00:37:46.121
60 chars. And so

1796
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.340
one prompt is getting

1797
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.360
scaled up by our

1798
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.380
agent. So try to

1799
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.639
guess how exactly we're

1800
00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:51.420
doing this, how we're

1801
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.318
making this work. But

1802
00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:52.956
you can see here

1803
00:37:53.016 --> 00:37:54.755
one prompt generates six

1804
00:37:54.795 --> 00:37:55.833
variations. This is a

1805
00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:57.869
copywriting machine, right? A

1806
00:37:57.869 --> 00:37:58.628
lot of writing, a

1807
00:37:58.628 --> 00:37:59.288
lot of thinking, a

1808
00:37:59.288 --> 00:38:00.858
lot of creating is
