206
00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:30.598
Code SDK work? Let's

207
00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:31.218
go ahead and break

208
00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:32.857
down the key ideas.

209
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:33.776
The SDK works like

210
00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:34.836
this. You set up

211
00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.276
your options, you set

212
00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:37.574
up your agent. Here

213
00:05:37.574 --> 00:05:38.413
we're just running the

214
00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:39.593
query and then you

215
00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:41.432
handle the response. The

216
00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:42.473
Claude Code SDK is

217
00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:43.591
a powerful tool for

218
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:45.290
putting together agents. As

219
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.810
you'll see, as we

220
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.149
progress, all the pieces

221
00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:48.209
are there and they're

222
00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.048
incrementally adoptable. And then

223
00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:50.889
lastly, we're just doing

224
00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.348
some logging. That's it.

225
00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:53.146
of our agent, right?

226
00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:54.605
A simple 150 line

227
00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:55.843
Pong agent. Most of

228
00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:56.723
this is just logging.

229
00:05:56.744 --> 00:05:57.423
We're setting up the

230
00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.742
agent. We're then querying

231
00:05:58.742 --> 00:05:59.701
the agent, we're then

232
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.221
handling the response of
