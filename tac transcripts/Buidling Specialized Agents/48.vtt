1114
00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:00.730
any endpoint, any web

1115
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.410
socket, any RSS feed,

1116
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.229
anything you want it

1117
00:24:03.249 --> 00:24:03.909
to be, right? This

1118
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.008
is an interesting form

1119
00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:06.467
factor for agents. They

1120
00:24:06.467 --> 00:24:08.305
can stream and process

1121
00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:09.403
information for you. They

1122
00:24:09.403 --> 00:24:10.483
can process the natural

1123
00:24:10.503 --> 00:24:11.981
language and determine if

1124
00:24:12.061 --> 00:24:13.721
something is happening based

1125
00:24:13.721 --> 00:24:14.779
on your interests. You

1126
00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:15.359
can see here, we

1127
00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:15.959
have a more built

1128
00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:16.679
up codebase, but

1129
00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:17.758
it all starts here.

1130
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.229
social hype agent, open

1131
00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:20.788
a main initial setup.

1132
00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:21.288
And then we have

1133
00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:22.288
a monitoring loop. Let's

1134
00:24:22.288 --> 00:24:22.788
go ahead and dive

1135
00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:24.166
into this, collapse everything

1136
00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:24.686
here. You can see

1137
00:24:24.686 --> 00:24:25.465
here it has several

1138
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:26.365
methods. The most important

1139
00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:27.825
one is monitor. There's

1140
00:24:27.825 --> 00:24:29.005
our web socket. There's

1141
00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:30.163
our worker. And inside
