1191
00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:30.351
prompt, right? That's why

1192
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:31.349
you always focus here.

1193
00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:32.229
First, let's open up

1194
00:25:32.229 --> 00:25:33.928
social hype system prompt.

1195
00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:35.028
Once again, look at

1196
00:25:35.028 --> 00:25:36.307
the directory structure, nice

1197
00:25:36.307 --> 00:25:37.726
and clean, very consistent.

1198
00:25:37.885 --> 00:25:39.444
We want consistent code-based

1199
00:25:39.444 --> 00:25:41.183
architecture for our agents,

1200
00:25:41.183 --> 00:25:42.343
for ourselves, for our

1201
00:25:42.343 --> 00:25:43.461
teams, all right? Come

1202
00:25:43.461 --> 00:25:44.837
to the prompt. collapse

1203
00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:45.957
everything, we can see

1204
00:25:45.957 --> 00:25:47.156
a more built out

1205
00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:48.435
prompt structure. If you've

1206
00:25:48.455 --> 00:25:49.994
taken the agentic prompt

1207
00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:52.213
engineering extended lesson inside

1208
00:25:52.213 --> 00:25:53.554
of agentic horizon, you

1209
00:25:53.554 --> 00:25:54.913
know exactly what this

1210
00:25:54.913 --> 00:25:55.432
is and what the

1211
00:25:55.432 --> 00:25:56.332
structure is and why

1212
00:25:56.332 --> 00:25:57.412
it's valuable. Let's go

1213
00:25:57.412 --> 00:25:58.172
ahead and take a

1214
00:25:58.172 --> 00:25:59.270
look at the purpose

1215
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.349
analyzing real time process
