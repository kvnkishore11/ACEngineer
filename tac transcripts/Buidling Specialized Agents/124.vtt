3024
01:01:59.222 --> 01:02:00.242
agent for this. You

3025
01:02:00.242 --> 01:02:01.240
know, there's an important

3026
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.221
idea here to echo

3027
01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:02.981
and you saw it

3028
01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:04.719
inside of the plan,

3029
01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:05.739
build, review and ship

3030
01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:06.800
agents, right? Our SDL

3031
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.559
micro agent workflow here.

3032
01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.438
That is a multi-agent

3033
01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:11.099
system. We just redeployed

3034
01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:11.739
a lot of the

3035
01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:12.617
baked in Claude Code

3036
01:02:12.617 --> 01:02:14.518
tools and functionality. We

3037
01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:15.717
only appended the system

3038
01:02:15.717 --> 01:02:16.577
prompt, right? So we

3039
01:02:16.617 --> 01:02:18.496
are just extending cloud

3040
01:02:18.496 --> 01:02:19.217
code and this is

3041
01:02:19.217 --> 01:02:20.295
a good delineation. There

3042
01:02:20.295 --> 01:02:21.996
are extension agents. or

3043
01:02:21.996 --> 01:02:23.675
extended agents, and then

3044
01:02:23.675 --> 01:02:25.215
there are complete custom

3045
01:02:25.215 --> 01:02:26.253
agents. This is really

3046
01:02:26.253 --> 01:02:28.213
defined when you overwrite

3047
01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:29.313
the system prompt and

3048
01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:30.733
then defined even further
