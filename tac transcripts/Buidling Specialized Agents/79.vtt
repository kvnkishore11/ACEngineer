00:39:29.954 --> 00:39:31.733
via its agent response.

1880
00:39:31.733 --> 00:39:32.452
I don't want any

1881
00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:33.132
tools running here. I

1882
00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:33.793
don't care about tool

1883
00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:35.052
calling here for this

1884
00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:35.992
problem, for this use

1885
00:39:35.992 --> 00:39:37.092
case, tool calling is

1886
00:39:37.112 --> 00:39:38.092
useless for me. This

1887
00:39:38.092 --> 00:39:39.231
does not provide value

1888
00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:40.030
to our users, to

1889
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.351
our customers in this

1890
00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:42.750
specific use case, but

1891
00:39:42.789 --> 00:39:43.309
we do have this

1892
00:39:43.329 --> 00:39:44.652
system prompt. And let's

1893
00:39:44.652 --> 00:39:45.233
go and open this

1894
00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:45.833
up, right? If we

1895
00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:47.152
collapse as normal, we

1896
00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:48.909
have the following. Purpose,

1897
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:51.168
variables, instructions, examples. If

1898
00:39:51.168 --> 00:39:52.108
you're noticing a pattern,

1899
00:39:52.108 --> 00:39:53.347
that's good. You're understanding

1900
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:53.945
what's going on here.

1901
00:39:53.945 --> 00:39:54.585
And this is actually

1902
00:39:54.585 --> 00:39:55.264
wrong here. This is

1903
00:39:55.264 --> 00:39:56.344
a bug. You're a

1904
00:39:56.344 --> 00:39:58.322
copywriter that responds with

1905
00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:00.101
number of versions, unique
