2440
00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:30.181
with reset so that

2441
00:50:30.181 --> 00:50:31.119
it clears out the

2442
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:32.519
current database. We have

2443
00:50:32.519 --> 00:50:33.599
two agents. We have

2444
00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:34.579
our streaming agent on

2445
00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:35.278
the right and we

2446
00:50:35.278 --> 00:50:36.737
have our chat interface

2447
00:50:36.737 --> 00:50:37.597
on the left. And

2448
00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:38.356
as you can see

2449
00:50:38.356 --> 00:50:39.556
here, our streaming agent

2450
00:50:39.556 --> 00:50:41.096
is a live process

2451
00:50:41.096 --> 00:50:43.175
feed of incoming logs.

2452
00:50:43.175 --> 00:50:44.393
So you can imagine

2453
00:50:44.393 --> 00:50:45.594
a log file coming

2454
00:50:45.594 --> 00:50:46.512
in from your backend,

2455
00:50:46.532 --> 00:50:48.492
Datadog, GCP, AWS, wherever

2456
00:50:48.492 --> 00:50:49.391
you handle your logs,

2457
00:50:49.452 --> 00:50:51.351
Just intake that information

2458
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:52.110
and let your agent

2459
00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:53.110
process on it and

2460
00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.190
filter for important information

2461
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.489
like this alert. All

2462
00:50:56.489 --> 00:50:57.349
right. Just by sitting

2463
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:58.110
here in this UI,

2464
00:50:58.170 --> 00:50:59.329
I got this alert.

2465
00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:00.528
The streaming agent is
