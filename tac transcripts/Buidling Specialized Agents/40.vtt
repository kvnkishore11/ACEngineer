WEBVTT

909
00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.696
basically configures your core

910
00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:01.977
for you then set

911
00:20:01.977 --> 00:20:03.215
up the SDK. So

912
00:20:03.215 --> 00:20:04.415
we're mounting the agent

913
00:20:04.415 --> 00:20:05.296
with the options and

914
00:20:05.296 --> 00:20:05.855
then you run your

915
00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:07.394
prompt. You then manage

916
00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:08.994
the responses. Your agent

917
00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:09.394
is going to do

918
00:20:09.394 --> 00:20:10.233
work for you. Do

919
00:20:10.233 --> 00:20:10.913
you know what it

920
00:20:10.913 --> 00:20:11.973
is? You know this

921
00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:13.513
by managing its responses.

922
00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:13.813
All right. So you

923
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:14.893
can see here we

924
00:20:14.893 --> 00:20:16.353
have two unique messages,

925
00:20:16.353 --> 00:20:17.912
assistant message and result

926
00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:19.011
message. Now, these might

927
00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:19.770
change. in the future,

928
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.611
right? It's very likely

929
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.829
these change. The key

930
00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:22.929
idea is that you

931
00:20:22.929 --> 00:20:23.968
understand how to manage

932
00:20:23.968 --> 00:20:24.987
the primitives of your

933
00:20:24.987 --> 00:20:26.006
custom agent. If we

934
00:20:26.006 --> 00:20:26.845
look at this, our

935
00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:27.844
result message is giving

936
00:20:27.844 --> 00:20:29.363
us session ID or

937
00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:30.582
we can get our
