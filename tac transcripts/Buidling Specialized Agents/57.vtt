1342
00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:30.277
have the model. We

1343
00:28:30.277 --> 00:28:31.557
have our tools. We

1344
00:28:31.557 --> 00:28:32.935
have that submit analysis

1345
00:28:32.935 --> 00:28:33.635
tool. and a notify

1346
00:28:33.635 --> 00:28:34.276
tool. We're not going

1347
00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:34.855
to dive into those.

1348
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:35.496
You can imagine what

1349
00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:36.576
they're doing. And then

1350
00:28:36.655 --> 00:28:38.515
again, importantly, we're clearing

1351
00:28:38.515 --> 00:28:39.414
the agent out, right?

1352
00:28:39.535 --> 00:28:40.174
I don't need these

1353
00:28:40.174 --> 00:28:41.934
capabilities. Your agent doesn't

1354
00:28:41.934 --> 00:28:43.015
need the capabilities. Get

1355
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:43.734
it out of the

1356
00:28:43.734 --> 00:28:45.075
context window. Remember, this

1357
00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:45.994
all ends up in

1358
00:28:45.994 --> 00:28:46.953
the context window, all

1359
00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:47.854
right? So we're clearing

1360
00:28:47.854 --> 00:28:48.413
out our agent. We're

1361
00:28:48.413 --> 00:28:49.913
letting our agent focus,

1362
00:28:49.913 --> 00:28:50.973
right? One agent, one

1363
00:28:50.973 --> 00:28:52.528
prompt, one purpose, a

1364
00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:53.768
max of three turns.

1365
00:28:53.768 --> 00:28:54.547
And then we're just

1366
00:28:54.547 --> 00:28:56.625
doing deterministic code stuff.

1367
00:28:56.704 --> 00:28:57.203
Let's move on to

1368
00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:58.403
our responses. You can

1369
00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.001
see here we have

1370
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:00.900
several different response blocks,
