2848
00:58:29.182 --> 00:58:30.543
Very importantly, you can

2849
00:58:30.543 --> 00:58:32.081
just call whatever tools

2850
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:32.762
you need to right

2851
00:58:32.762 --> 00:58:34.581
from your domain specific

2852
00:58:34.621 --> 00:58:36.400
UI and your application.

2853
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.380
Okay, so very powerful

2854
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:37.900
stuff here. I think

2855
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.639
you get the point.

2856
00:58:38.659 --> 00:58:39.119
This is how you

2857
00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:40.878
can deploy custom agents.

2858
00:58:40.958 --> 00:58:41.778
We can then notify

2859
00:58:41.778 --> 00:58:42.579
our support team, notify

2860
00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:43.777
our engineering team and

2861
00:58:43.777 --> 00:58:44.717
stack this up to

2862
00:58:44.717 --> 00:58:45.617
do whatever we need

2863
00:58:45.617 --> 00:58:46.237
it to do. You

2864
00:58:46.237 --> 00:58:47.177
can see the options,

2865
00:58:47.177 --> 00:58:48.496
same kind of format,

2866
00:58:48.657 --> 00:58:50.076
allowed tools, disallowed tools,

2867
00:58:50.076 --> 00:58:51.416
system prompt. This is

2868
00:58:51.416 --> 00:58:52.795
a complete custom agent.

2869
00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.994
For Zoom, there's a

2870
00:58:53.994 --> 00:58:55.414
model. Here's our custom

2871
00:58:55.594 --> 00:58:57.054
MCP server. We are

2872
00:58:57.186 --> 00:58:59.813
building specialized agents. Now

2873
00:58:59.914 --> 00:59:01.534
let's talk about when
