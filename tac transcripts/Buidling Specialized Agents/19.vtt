405
00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:30.404
a simple agent. It

406
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.203
doesn't need powerful intelligence.

407
00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:33.783
So we've dropped down

408
00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:34.604
the model. As you

409
00:09:34.604 --> 00:09:35.582
progress through each agent,

410
00:09:35.663 --> 00:09:37.043
keep in mind, we

411
00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.342
have the 12 leverage

412
00:09:38.342 --> 00:09:39.841
points of agentic coding

413
00:09:39.942 --> 00:09:40.782
that we're paying attention

414
00:09:40.782 --> 00:09:42.022
to. But whenever you

415
00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:43.140
see Claude Code options,

416
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.701
isolate the core four.

417
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.541
How will the core

418
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.100
four be managed given

419
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.820
this setup? Now we

420
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.820
have something else here

421
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.719
that's important to call

422
00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:51.178
out. We're using the

423
00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:53.578
Claude SDK client class

424
00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:54.818
instead of our pong

425
00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:55.738
agent where we were

426
00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:56.937
just using that query

427
00:09:56.937 --> 00:09:58.038
command. All right. So

428
00:09:58.038 --> 00:09:59.238
query is for one

429
00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:00.657
off prompts and the
