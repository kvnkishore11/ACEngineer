3048
01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:30.733
then defined even further

3049
01:02:30.733 --> 01:02:31.512
when you start using

3050
01:02:31.512 --> 01:02:32.911
your own custom tools,

3051
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:34.172
right? For our UltraStream

3052
01:02:34.172 --> 01:02:35.231
agent, this was not

3053
01:02:35.231 --> 01:02:36.311
the Claude Code product

3054
01:02:36.411 --> 01:02:37.469
at all, right? We're

3055
01:02:37.469 --> 01:02:38.309
using the Claude Code

3056
01:02:38.449 --> 01:02:40.608
SDK harness, absolutely. That's

3057
01:02:40.608 --> 01:02:41.048
where a lot of

3058
01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:41.889
the value is in

3059
01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:42.568
agents. It's in the

3060
01:02:42.568 --> 01:02:43.547
agent loop, it's in

3061
01:02:43.547 --> 01:02:44.588
prompt caching, it's in

3062
01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:44.967
a lot of the

3063
01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:46.206
niceties that they provide

3064
01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:47.007
out of the box,

3065
01:02:47.007 --> 01:02:47.827
but we did not

3066
01:02:47.827 --> 01:02:49.065
use Claude Code at

3067
01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.706
all, right? our SDLC

3068
01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:52.125
micro agents here, they

3069
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.423
did. This is software

3070
01:02:53.423 --> 01:02:54.123
work. That's what Cloud

3071
01:02:54.123 --> 01:02:54.884
Code is for. So

3072
01:02:54.923 --> 01:02:56.483
don't step on these

3073
01:02:56.483 --> 01:02:57.481
boundaries too much. If

3074
01:02:57.481 --> 01:02:58.282
you're working on engineering

3075
01:02:58.282 --> 01:02:59.880
work, you probably just

3076
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.800
need to fine tune
