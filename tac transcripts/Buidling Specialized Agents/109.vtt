2641
00:54:29.326 --> 00:54:30.206
fact, if we threw

2642
00:54:30.286 --> 00:54:31.306
all of these logs

2643
00:54:31.306 --> 00:54:32.065
in here at the

2644
00:54:32.065 --> 00:54:33.184
same time, it would

2645
00:54:33.184 --> 00:54:33.684
not be able to

2646
00:54:33.684 --> 00:54:35.045
process them without taking

2647
00:54:35.045 --> 00:54:35.583
a lot of time,

2648
00:54:35.583 --> 00:54:36.523
a lot of tokens,

2649
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:36.943
and that means a

2650
00:54:36.943 --> 00:54:38.023
lot of capital. But

2651
00:54:38.023 --> 00:54:39.043
we of course have

2652
00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:41.563
built fine-grained tools to

2653
00:54:41.563 --> 00:54:42.862
help our agent operate

2654
00:54:42.902 --> 00:54:43.942
this specific use case.

2655
00:54:43.942 --> 00:54:45.521
You cannot do this

2656
00:54:45.521 --> 00:54:47.420
without serious prompt engineering

2657
00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:48.360
with a out of

2658
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.760
the box agent. Okay,

2659
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.679
we have a tool

2660
00:54:50.679 --> 00:54:52.239
for this domain specific

2661
00:54:52.717 --> 00:54:54.371
Saving money, saving tokens,

2662
00:54:54.371 --> 00:54:55.885
saving time. Start line

2663
00:54:55.885 --> 00:54:57.641
index, inline index, you

2664
00:54:57.641 --> 00:54:58.280
can see our agent

2665
00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.719
is processing logs and

2666
00:54:59.719 --> 00:55:01.139
chunks, right? So we're
