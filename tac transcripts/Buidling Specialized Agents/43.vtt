988
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.826
interesting, more complex, kind

989
00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:31.704
of built out code

990
00:21:31.704 --> 00:21:33.443
base. We're adding complexity

991
00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:34.503
as we add capabilities

992
00:21:34.503 --> 00:21:35.163
to our agent. Let's

993
00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:35.643
just go ahead and

994
00:21:35.643 --> 00:21:36.461
kick this off and

995
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.000
understand how this works.

996
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.759
UVR, social hype agent.

997
00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:40.339
We're gonna kick off

998
00:21:40.339 --> 00:21:41.499
our social hype agent

999
00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:42.298
and notice here we're

1000
00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:44.342
passing in keywords and

1001
00:21:44.342 --> 00:21:44.721
then we're going to

1002
00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.060
run this dash n

1003
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.740
which is a notification

1004
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.019
prompt any mention of

1005
00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:50.539
new language model releases

1006
00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:51.619
any mention of hacking

1007
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.459
prompting or educational posts

1008
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:54.979
surrounding these companies okay

1009
00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:55.857
let's fire this off

1010
00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:56.917
and let's understand what's

1011
00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.238
happening here so this

1012
00:21:58.238 --> 00:21:58.916
is not a terminal

1013
00:21:58.916 --> 00:21:59.757
interface this is not

1014
00:21:59.757 --> 00:22:00.836
a script this is
