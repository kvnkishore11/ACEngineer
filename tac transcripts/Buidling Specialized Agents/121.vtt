2948
01:00:29.394 --> 01:00:30.518
the loop, like many

2949
01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:31.516
of us are with

2950
01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:32.335
our agents, right? You

2951
01:00:32.335 --> 01:00:32.996
just boot up a

2952
01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.094
Claude Code agent, prompting

2953
01:00:34.094 --> 01:00:34.775
back and forth, getting

2954
01:00:34.775 --> 01:00:36.153
work done. There's no

2955
01:00:36.153 --> 01:00:37.213
reason to build a

2956
01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:38.012
custom agent to do

2957
01:00:38.012 --> 01:00:38.931
this unless you have

2958
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.489
some grandiose idea on

2959
01:00:40.489 --> 01:00:41.550
how to build a

2960
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.228
better agentic coding tool

2961
01:00:43.228 --> 01:00:43.748
than some of the

2962
01:00:43.748 --> 01:00:45.306
best engineers doing this

2963
01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:47.677
24 seven. Okay, you

2964
01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.297
can extend this a

2965
01:00:48.297 --> 01:00:49.097
little bit, make it

2966
01:00:49.097 --> 01:00:49.996
your own. You might

2967
01:00:49.996 --> 01:00:51.137
like to build your

2968
01:00:51.137 --> 01:00:52.097
own UI wrapper around

2969
01:00:52.097 --> 01:00:53.036
this, whatever. Also, I

2970
01:00:53.036 --> 01:00:53.956
don't wanna violate any

2971
01:00:53.956 --> 01:00:54.916
terms of service at

2972
01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:56.115
all. In no way

2973
01:00:56.115 --> 01:00:56.596
do I think you

2974
01:00:56.596 --> 01:00:57.615
should try to compete

2975
01:00:57.615 --> 01:00:58.396
with Claude Code. I

2976
01:00:58.396 --> 01:00:59.295
think that's actually a

2977
01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:01.635
massive mistake. They own
