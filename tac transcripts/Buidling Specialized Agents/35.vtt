783
00:17:28.773 --> 00:17:30.612
how you understand your

784
00:17:30.612 --> 00:17:32.589
agents core for minus

785
00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:33.568
the user prompt, right?

786
00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:34.528
The user prompt comes

787
00:17:34.548 --> 00:17:35.846
in via our client

788
00:17:35.886 --> 00:17:37.306
dot query. All right.

789
00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:38.505
And of course here

790
00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:39.324
we are focused on

791
00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:40.801
the Claude Code SDK.

792
00:17:40.842 --> 00:17:42.101
Every other agent SDK

793
00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:43.539
will have some version

794
00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:44.718
of this. All right.

795
00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:45.589
So yes, We are

796
00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:46.749
big Claude Code fans

797
00:17:46.749 --> 00:17:47.888
and yes, we will

798
00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:48.688
always use the best

799
00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:49.488
tool for the job

800
00:17:49.587 --> 00:17:51.346
and we think bigger

801
00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:52.965
than single tools, right?

802
00:17:52.965 --> 00:17:53.746
This is not about

803
00:17:53.746 --> 00:17:54.766
a single tool. This

804
00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:55.625
is about the best

805
00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:56.345
tool for the job

806
00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:58.124
and understanding agents and

807
00:17:58.124 --> 00:18:00.083
custom agents at large,
