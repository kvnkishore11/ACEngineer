1397
00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:30.252
you here, but let's

1398
00:29:30.272 --> 00:29:31.412
go ahead and continue.

1399
00:29:31.412 --> 00:29:32.352
You can see here,

1400
00:29:32.352 --> 00:29:32.991
we're not getting any

1401
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:34.631
notifications, but our agent

1402
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:36.230
is processing this one

1403
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.170
match item so far

1404
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.409
because we saw, looks

1405
00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:38.769
like we saw a

1406
00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:40.688
cloud here, GPT, right?

1407
00:29:40.688 --> 00:29:42.385
user message, of course,

1408
00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:44.224
all anonymized. Let's proceed

1409
00:29:44.224 --> 00:29:48.540
to our next powerful

1410
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.640
agent. So what's a

1411
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.659
QA agent? How does

1412
00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:51.357
this work? What's going

1413
00:29:51.357 --> 00:29:52.477
on here? This agent

1414
00:29:52.477 --> 00:29:53.096
kicks things up a

1415
00:29:53.096 --> 00:29:53.875
notch. Let's go ahead

1416
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:54.515
and just fire this

1417
00:29:54.515 --> 00:29:56.213
up. UVRQA agent.py. You

1418
00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:57.311
can see here we

1419
00:29:57.311 --> 00:29:57.892
are back in the

1420
00:29:57.892 --> 00:29:58.810
terminal. We have a

1421
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:00.846
terminal interface. This agent
