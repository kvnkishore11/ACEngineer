WEBVTT

555
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.909
prompt. Okay. Very simple.

556
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.320
Right? Again, it's important

557
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.139
to call out, this

558
00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:33.977
is not the Claude

559
00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:35.596
Code product anymore. As

560
00:12:35.596 --> 00:12:36.695
soon as you touch

561
00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:38.253
the system prompt and

562
00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:39.270
once you start dialing

563
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.529
into the tools, you

564
00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:42.187
change the product, you

565
00:12:42.187 --> 00:12:44.004
change the agent. All

566
00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:44.823
right? So you can

567
00:12:44.823 --> 00:12:46.782
see here, title, purpose,

568
00:12:46.913 --> 00:12:47.832
Echo agent use the

569
00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:48.773
tool when asked. All

570
00:12:48.773 --> 00:12:49.511
right. So there's not

571
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:50.691
a lot happening here,

572
00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.250
but there is a

573
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.629
lot that was happening

574
00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:54.089
that isn't happening anymore.

575
00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:54.927
Right. If that makes

576
00:12:54.947 --> 00:12:56.106
sense, we have blown

577
00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.586
away the Claude Code

578
00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:58.385
system prompt. We have

579
00:12:58.385 --> 00:12:59.943
completely overwritten it. Now,

580
00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:00.484
it is important to
