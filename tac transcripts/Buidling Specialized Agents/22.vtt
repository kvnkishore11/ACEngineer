481
00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:00.798
if you don't adopt

482
00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:02.297
your agent's perspective, it

483
00:11:02.297 --> 00:11:03.177
will be hard to

484
00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:04.375
improve them and tweak

485
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:05.395
them and manage them.

486
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.096
So that's what we're

487
00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:07.054
doing here. And you

488
00:11:07.054 --> 00:11:07.894
can see the followup

489
00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:08.995
prompt. We fired off

490
00:11:08.995 --> 00:11:10.586
that additional query. and

491
00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:11.765
we just looked for

492
00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:13.284
that one response, right?

493
00:11:13.284 --> 00:11:13.725
We're looking for a

494
00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:14.865
tool use block and

495
00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:15.725
really we only were

496
00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:16.464
looking for the text

497
00:11:16.464 --> 00:11:17.423
block here, right? This

498
00:11:17.423 --> 00:11:18.224
is not actually that

499
00:11:18.224 --> 00:11:20.102
useful. This is a

500
00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:21.462
customization with a few

501
00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:22.802
more capabilities, right? We've

502
00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:24.662
specified the model, we've

503
00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:25.922
given it a custom

504
00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:26.740
tool to work with,

505
00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:28.541
but here's something interesting

506
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.640
that if you're using

507
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.360
these agents left and
