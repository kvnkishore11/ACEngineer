1316
00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:00.752
know the workflow. So

1317
00:28:00.833 --> 00:28:01.211
we can put it

1318
00:28:01.211 --> 00:28:02.030
in the system prompt.

1319
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:03.069
It's the law. We

1320
00:28:03.069 --> 00:28:04.029
always want this to

1321
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.788
happen. You can see

1322
00:28:04.788 --> 00:28:05.689
the instructions there. I'm

1323
00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:06.307
not gonna dive into

1324
00:28:06.307 --> 00:28:07.028
these too much. The

1325
00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:07.807
one important thing to

1326
00:28:07.807 --> 00:28:09.007
mention is that inside

1327
00:28:09.007 --> 00:28:09.846
your system prompt in

1328
00:28:09.846 --> 00:28:11.506
some capacity, I recommend

1329
00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:13.025
having a tool usage

1330
00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:15.483
requirements slash usage guide

1331
00:28:15.523 --> 00:28:17.022
that helps further guide

1332
00:28:17.022 --> 00:28:18.663
your tool usage. That's

1333
00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.162
happening here. Summary sentiment

1334
00:28:20.162 --> 00:28:22.121
keyword, optionally use notify

1335
00:28:22.121 --> 00:28:22.840
when it meets the

1336
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.000
notification criteria, right? Which

1337
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.739
we pass in right

1338
00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:26.679
here. So this is

1339
00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:27.637
the system prompt. This

1340
00:28:27.637 --> 00:28:28.617
is the law for

1341
00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:29.438
the agent. We then

1342
00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:30.277
have the model. We
