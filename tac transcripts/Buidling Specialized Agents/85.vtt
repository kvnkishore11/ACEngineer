2032
00:42:29.106 --> 00:42:31.724
seven micro SDLC agent.

2033
00:42:31.724 --> 00:42:33.083
Let's understand the structure

2034
00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:33.981
of this codebase.

2035
00:42:34.242 --> 00:42:35.121
back end, front end,

2036
00:42:35.141 --> 00:42:37.141
reviews, specs, and a

2037
00:42:37.141 --> 00:42:38.161
couple of test files.

2038
00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:38.960
So let's go ahead

2039
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.701
and just kick this

2040
00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:40.260
off. We already have

2041
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.721
this running here, back

2042
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:42.820
end, front end. Let's

2043
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.119
see exactly what this

2044
00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:45.280
is. You probably understand

2045
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.980
what's going on here,

2046
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.219
right? We have an

2047
00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:49.139
agent by agent task

2048
00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:50.398
board where we hand

2049
00:42:50.398 --> 00:42:51.358
off work from one

2050
00:42:51.358 --> 00:42:52.398
agent to another agent

2051
00:42:52.398 --> 00:42:52.998
in a kind of

2052
00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:54.818
micro software development life

2053
00:42:54.818 --> 00:42:55.998
cycle. Now you can

2054
00:42:55.998 --> 00:42:56.699
see here, we have

2055
00:42:56.739 --> 00:42:57.498
a couple of tasks

2056
00:42:57.498 --> 00:42:58.277
already shipped. We have

2057
00:42:58.277 --> 00:42:59.057
some aired ones over

2058
00:42:59.057 --> 00:43:00.057
here. Let's just go
