2692
00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:30.186
point out this fact

2693
00:55:30.186 --> 00:55:31.186
that we are building

2694
00:55:31.186 --> 00:55:32.226
a specialized agent to

2695
00:55:32.226 --> 00:55:33.266
operate on a file

2696
00:55:33.306 --> 00:55:34.965
in a token efficient

2697
00:55:35.005 --> 00:55:36.264
way, okay? So that's

2698
00:55:36.264 --> 00:55:37.465
our stream agent. And

2699
00:55:37.465 --> 00:55:37.965
we can of course

2700
00:55:37.985 --> 00:55:38.965
see all the tools

2701
00:55:38.965 --> 00:55:40.083
getting built up here.

2702
00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.384
It's then producing a

2703
00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:43.663
summarized log one piece

2704
00:55:43.663 --> 00:55:44.322
at a time. If

2705
00:55:44.322 --> 00:55:45.543
we open up our

2706
00:55:45.543 --> 00:55:47.422
stream agent system prompt,

2707
00:55:47.481 --> 00:55:48.322
you can see here,

2708
00:55:48.342 --> 00:55:48.882
we have a couple

2709
00:55:48.882 --> 00:55:50.202
of static variables. We

2710
00:55:50.202 --> 00:55:51.621
could dynamically set these

2711
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:52.681
static variables, but these

2712
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.960
are just purely static.

2713
00:55:53.981 --> 00:55:54.699
We're letting our agent

2714
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.119
manage its own context

2715
00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.380
window. with this variable

2716
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.418
that updates some code

2717
00:55:58.418 --> 00:55:59.478
that clears the context

2718
00:55:59.478 --> 00:56:00.559
window by updating the
