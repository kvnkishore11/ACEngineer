1540
00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:30.308
This is where we

1541
00:32:30.308 --> 00:32:31.867
declare the majority of

1542
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.008
the core four. And

1543
00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:33.327
so we have a

1544
00:32:33.327 --> 00:32:34.347
new addition here. We

1545
00:32:34.347 --> 00:32:35.208
have some hooks. We

1546
00:32:35.208 --> 00:32:36.127
have our resumes. We're

1547
00:32:36.127 --> 00:32:37.347
gonna continue the conversation.

1548
00:32:37.347 --> 00:32:38.987
Of course, we're explicitly

1549
00:32:38.987 --> 00:32:40.686
declaring the model. We're

1550
00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:41.366
getting rid of some

1551
00:32:41.366 --> 00:32:42.866
tools. We're allowing some

1552
00:32:42.866 --> 00:32:44.846
other tools. And most

1553
00:32:44.846 --> 00:32:46.266
importantly, above all, we

1554
00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:47.645
have our own system

1555
00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.905
prompts. Understand the system

1556
00:32:48.905 --> 00:32:51.205
prompt. QA agent system

1557
00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:52.244
prompt. Look at that

1558
00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:53.684
consistent codebase. Once

1559
00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:56.023
again, no confusion anywhere

1560
00:32:56.023 --> 00:32:56.963
over and over and

1561
00:32:56.963 --> 00:32:58.064
over and over. Once

1562
00:32:58.064 --> 00:32:58.702
you find the winning

1563
00:32:58.702 --> 00:33:00.423
patterns, keep using them
