2873
00:58:59.914 --> 00:59:01.534
let's talk about when

2874
00:59:01.534 --> 00:59:02.572
you should use this,

2875
00:59:02.632 --> 00:59:03.413
all right? Because you

2876
00:59:03.413 --> 00:59:05.452
don't always need custom

2877
00:59:05.492 --> 00:59:06.512
agents to do this

2878
00:59:06.512 --> 00:59:07.251
work. In fact, you

2879
00:59:07.251 --> 00:59:08.530
saw that in our

2880
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:10.090
microagent application, right? We

2881
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:12.369
extended the existing capabilities

2882
00:59:12.429 --> 00:59:13.148
right out of Cloud

2883
00:59:13.148 --> 00:59:14.628
Code via the Cloud

2884
00:59:14.628 --> 00:59:16.387
Code SDK. So when

2885
00:59:16.387 --> 00:59:17.086
should you build a

2886
00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:18.387
custom agent? You build

2887
00:59:18.387 --> 00:59:19.585
custom agents when you

2888
00:59:19.585 --> 00:59:20.626
need one of these

2889
00:59:20.626 --> 00:59:21.864
things. If you need

2890
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.724
programmatic agents, if you

2891
00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:25.224
need to solve repeat

2892
00:59:25.224 --> 00:59:26.822
workflows with agents, if

2893
00:59:26.822 --> 00:59:27.402
you need to solve

2894
00:59:27.443 --> 00:59:30.202
domain-specific problems, better than
