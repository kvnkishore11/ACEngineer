120
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:30.701
the Pong agent. So

121
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.841
here's a simple agent

122
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.920
that's gonna showcase the

123
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.039
most important aspect of

124
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.658
custom agents. You can

125
00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:37.418
see we have a

126
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:39.717
simple, concise user prompt

127
00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:41.096
and agent response, and

128
00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:41.795
we have some session

129
00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:43.034
stats. Let's run this

130
00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:43.754
again, all right? Let's

131
00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:44.335
go ahead and change

132
00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:45.493
our prompt. Hello, simple

133
00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:46.393
prompt. We're just getting

134
00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.752
started with custom agents.

135
00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:48.812
I said hello, it

136
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.131
just responded with Pong,

137
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.469
okay? Summarize this code

138
00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.009
base. Okay, there's my

139
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.709
user prompt. And once

140
00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.087
again, the Pong agent

141
00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.448
is responding again with

142
00:03:58.448 --> 00:03:59.546
Pong. What's going on

143
00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:00.706
here? Let's ask it
