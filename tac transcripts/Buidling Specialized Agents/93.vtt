2237
00:46:29.722 --> 00:46:30.702
in here and let's

2238
00:46:30.702 --> 00:46:32.021
just search our cloud

2239
00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:32.840
code options, right? This

2240
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.621
is a great place

2241
00:46:33.621 --> 00:46:34.739
to start when you're

2242
00:46:34.739 --> 00:46:35.277
just quickly looking through

2243
00:46:35.277 --> 00:46:36.507
agents and you want

2244
00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.190
to know where to

2245
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.769
start. So we have

2246
00:46:37.769 --> 00:46:39.608
the following configuration. Super

2247
00:46:39.608 --> 00:46:40.347
important here, we do

2248
00:46:40.347 --> 00:46:41.288
have hooks. So we

2249
00:46:41.288 --> 00:46:42.806
are limiting our agent.

2250
00:46:42.806 --> 00:46:43.827
We're giving our planner

2251
00:46:43.827 --> 00:46:44.865
agent a right hook.

2252
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:46.045
And we're basically just

2253
00:46:46.045 --> 00:46:46.804
saying, where is it

2254
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.105
exactly? We're saying a

2255
00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:49.143
normalized path here. We're

2256
00:46:49.143 --> 00:46:50.523
getting the path to

2257
00:46:50.523 --> 00:46:51.503
whatever it's trying to

2258
00:46:51.503 --> 00:46:52.483
write to. And we're

2259
00:46:52.483 --> 00:46:53.282
making sure that our

2260
00:46:53.282 --> 00:46:54.822
writer agent can only

2261
00:46:54.822 --> 00:46:55.800
write to our plan

2262
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.500
directory. There is no

2263
00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.199
other reason for a

2264
00:46:58.219 --> 00:46:59.498
planner to do anything

2265
00:46:59.498 --> 00:47:00.639
else. So we're making
