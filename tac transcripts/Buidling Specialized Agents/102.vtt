2465
00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:00.528
The streaming agent is

2466
00:51:00.528 --> 00:51:01.889
summarizing the logs. It's

2467
00:51:01.889 --> 00:51:03.027
understanding the logs, it's

2468
00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:04.307
ingesting them. And it's

2469
00:51:04.307 --> 00:51:05.387
letting me know if

2470
00:51:05.387 --> 00:51:06.266
there's something that needs

2471
00:51:06.266 --> 00:51:07.146
my attention. We have

2472
00:51:07.146 --> 00:51:08.027
an alert here. So

2473
00:51:08.027 --> 00:51:08.726
I can dial into

2474
00:51:08.726 --> 00:51:10.405
this with our inspector

2475
00:51:10.405 --> 00:51:11.186
agent on the left.

2476
00:51:11.246 --> 00:51:12.686
I'll say a list

2477
00:51:12.766 --> 00:51:14.784
issues one through three

2478
00:51:14.965 --> 00:51:17.005
log summary only and

2479
00:51:17.005 --> 00:51:17.983
user. So we're taking

2480
00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:19.003
that off. And of

2481
00:51:19.003 --> 00:51:20.382
course, our agent is

2482
00:51:20.382 --> 00:51:21.822
looking at this formatted

2483
00:51:21.842 --> 00:51:22.961
data. It's calling its

2484
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:24.262
own tool set built

2485
00:51:24.262 --> 00:51:25.840
up for this specific

2486
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.920
use case, right? This

2487
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.239
domain specific use case.

2488
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.159
And then it's outputting

2489
00:51:29.199 --> 00:51:30.539
some markdown here for
