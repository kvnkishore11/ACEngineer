964
00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.068
understanding what you can

965
00:21:00.068 --> 00:21:01.067
do with custom agents.

966
00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:01.708
All right. So this

967
00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:02.467
is great. It's also

968
00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:03.366
really important to call

969
00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:05.286
out these SDKs, specifically

970
00:21:05.286 --> 00:21:06.486
the Claude Code SDK.

971
00:21:06.486 --> 00:21:07.464
It has built in

972
00:21:07.464 --> 00:21:08.723
prompt caching. So you

973
00:21:08.723 --> 00:21:09.743
will be saving money.

974
00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:11.241
by using this out

975
00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:12.121
of the box, right?

976
00:21:12.121 --> 00:21:13.038
By just tuning and

977
00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.517
tweaking your custom agent

978
00:21:14.537 --> 00:21:15.516
with the Claude Code

979
00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:16.673
SDK. Let's scale up.

980
00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:17.432
Let's move on to

981
00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:19.131
more capable agents and

982
00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:20.449
look at an interesting

983
00:21:20.449 --> 00:21:21.507
and on-tapped use case

984
00:21:21.507 --> 00:21:24.930
of agents. Next we

985
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.769
have our social hype

986
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:27.907
agent. We're starting to

987
00:21:27.907 --> 00:21:28.747
build up a more

988
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.826
interesting, more complex, kind
