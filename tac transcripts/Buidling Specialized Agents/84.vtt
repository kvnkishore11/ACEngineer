2009
00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:00.295
get to the most

2010
00:42:00.295 --> 00:42:01.574
important piece, which is

2011
00:42:01.594 --> 00:42:03.034
right here, our agents

2012
00:42:03.034 --> 00:42:04.795
options, which then gets

2013
00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:05.755
passed into our agents

2014
00:42:05.775 --> 00:42:07.434
SDK, which then gets

2015
00:42:07.434 --> 00:42:09.054
queried on. And so

2016
00:42:09.094 --> 00:42:10.295
same deal, right? You

2017
00:42:10.295 --> 00:42:11.295
set up the options,

2018
00:42:11.335 --> 00:42:11.835
you set up the

2019
00:42:11.835 --> 00:42:13.175
agent, you query, and

2020
00:42:13.175 --> 00:42:13.695
then you manage the

2021
00:42:13.695 --> 00:42:14.934
responses. Here's our assistant

2022
00:42:14.934 --> 00:42:16.054
block. Here's our result

2023
00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:17.273
block where we're managing

2024
00:42:17.373 --> 00:42:18.574
session ID costs, so

2025
00:42:18.574 --> 00:42:19.173
on and so forth.

2026
00:42:19.173 --> 00:42:20.293
Assistant message, all we

2027
00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:21.054
care about is the

2028
00:42:21.054 --> 00:42:22.353
text block. Okay, let's

2029
00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:23.233
move on to our

2030
00:42:23.233 --> 00:42:27.768
next powerful agent. Now

2031
00:42:27.768 --> 00:42:29.106
we arrive at custom

2032
00:42:29.106 --> 00:42:31.724
seven micro SDLC agent.
