2321
00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:00.469
here we also have

2322
00:48:00.927 --> 00:48:02.387
individual user prompts that

2323
00:48:02.387 --> 00:48:02.947
we're passing in as

2324
00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:03.405
well. So we have

2325
00:48:03.405 --> 00:48:05.503
planner user prompt. Okay,

2326
00:48:05.503 --> 00:48:05.943
you can see the

2327
00:48:05.943 --> 00:48:07.543
structure here, system prompts,

2328
00:48:07.681 --> 00:48:08.501
and we have user

2329
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:09.920
prompts. So we're separating

2330
00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.059
our prompts, we're creating

2331
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:12.538
dedicated spaces. These aren't

2332
00:48:12.717 --> 00:48:14.175
custom slash commands. These

2333
00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:15.893
are dedicated prompts, we

2334
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.253
could for sure make

2335
00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:18.673
these custom slash commands,

2336
00:48:18.693 --> 00:48:19.952
but for the SDLC,

2337
00:48:19.952 --> 00:48:20.952
it's much easier to

2338
00:48:20.952 --> 00:48:22.572
just have concrete files

2339
00:48:22.572 --> 00:48:23.672
that we then replace,

2340
00:48:23.672 --> 00:48:25.492
okay? Classic agentic prompt

2341
00:48:25.492 --> 00:48:27.291
format here for prompts

2342
00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:28.572
going into your agentic

2343
00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.652
coding tools. We have

2344
00:48:29.652 --> 00:48:31.211
the title, the purpose,
