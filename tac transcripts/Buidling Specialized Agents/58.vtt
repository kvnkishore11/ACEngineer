1370
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:00.900
several different response blocks,

1371
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.219
assistant messages, and we

1372
00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:03.876
have result messages. And

1373
00:29:03.876 --> 00:29:04.715
then in our assistant

1374
00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:05.855
messages, we have a

1375
00:29:05.855 --> 00:29:06.953
text block, the tool

1376
00:29:06.953 --> 00:29:07.952
use block, and the

1377
00:29:07.952 --> 00:29:09.391
tool result block. And

1378
00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:10.090
so we're just processing

1379
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.021
all that. As you

1380
00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:11.761
saw here, we can

1381
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:12.320
just kick this off

1382
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:12.941
again and let it

1383
00:29:12.941 --> 00:29:14.119
stream a few more.

1384
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.980
This is a data

1385
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.759
streaming agent. It's handling

1386
00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.398
this for us. You

1387
00:29:17.398 --> 00:29:18.538
can imagine this running

1388
00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:20.198
on a log stream,

1389
00:29:20.218 --> 00:29:21.076
you know, some live

1390
00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:22.996
feed that is critical

1391
00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.395
for your engineering success

1392
00:29:24.415 --> 00:29:25.494
and reporting to you,

1393
00:29:25.494 --> 00:29:26.694
reporting via a user

1394
00:29:26.694 --> 00:29:27.713
interface, you know, hint,

1395
00:29:27.713 --> 00:29:28.574
hint. I'm excited to

1396
00:29:28.574 --> 00:29:29.093
share that one with

1397
00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:30.252
you here, but let's
