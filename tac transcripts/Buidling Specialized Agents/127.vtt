3103
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.431
build extended agents use

3104
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.210
the out-of-the-box agents as

3105
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.951
much as you can

3106
01:03:32.951 --> 01:03:33.751
and then only when

3107
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:34.590
you need to build

3108
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:36.130
your complete custom agent

3109
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:37.831
with unique prompts models

3110
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.969
hooks tools permissions so

3111
01:03:39.969 --> 01:03:40.570
on and so forth

3112
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.269
tailored to your domain

3113
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:43.730
specific use case that

3114
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:44.690
being said as you

3115
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.630
scale up as you

3116
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.170
become more capable As

3117
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.329
you become an agentic

3118
01:03:48.329 --> 01:03:49.748
engineer that focuses on

3119
01:03:49.889 --> 01:03:51.507
building systems, that builds

3120
01:03:51.507 --> 01:03:52.967
systems, right, as you

3121
01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:55.106
compose the outer layer,

3122
01:03:55.106 --> 01:03:56.686
the new agentic layer

3123
01:03:56.686 --> 01:03:57.626
of your codebase,

3124
01:03:57.885 --> 01:03:59.244
you will want custom

3125
01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:01.085
agents to perform better
