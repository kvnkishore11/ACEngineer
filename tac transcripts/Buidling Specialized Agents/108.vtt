2618
00:53:59.938 --> 00:54:00.777
if there are issues

2619
00:54:00.777 --> 00:54:01.438
we should get to.

2620
00:54:01.518 --> 00:54:02.697
The most important thing

2621
00:54:02.697 --> 00:54:03.556
here is that, you

2622
00:54:03.556 --> 00:54:04.896
know, this is operating

2623
00:54:04.896 --> 00:54:06.434
on what could be

2624
00:54:06.434 --> 00:54:08.414
an insurmountable log file.

2625
00:54:08.414 --> 00:54:08.914
If we go into

2626
00:54:08.914 --> 00:54:10.233
data, open up our

2627
00:54:10.233 --> 00:54:11.572
stream log here, and

2628
00:54:11.572 --> 00:54:12.532
imagine the stream log

2629
00:54:12.532 --> 00:54:13.791
is coming from anywhere,

2630
00:54:13.811 --> 00:54:15.311
right? We have 42,000

2631
00:54:15.311 --> 00:54:17.130
tokens. This will be

2632
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.809
much, much bigger as

2633
00:54:18.809 --> 00:54:20.168
your data streams in

2634
00:54:20.168 --> 00:54:21.487
from whatever service you're

2635
00:54:21.487 --> 00:54:22.907
working with. Right now,

2636
00:54:23.047 --> 00:54:24.847
our agent is obviously

2637
00:54:24.847 --> 00:54:26.086
operating on this file.

2638
00:54:26.146 --> 00:54:27.447
It could be many,

2639
00:54:27.447 --> 00:54:28.465
many times larger than

2640
00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:29.326
its context window. In

2641
00:54:29.326 --> 00:54:30.206
fact, if we threw
