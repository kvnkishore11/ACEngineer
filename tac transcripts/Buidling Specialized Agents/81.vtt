1932
00:40:28.878 --> 00:40:30.038
you know, prompt engineering

1933
00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:31.577
application perspective. It is

1934
00:40:31.577 --> 00:40:32.697
important that this agent

1935
00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:34.715
can see every variation.

1936
00:40:34.835 --> 00:40:35.516
Otherwise you need to

1937
00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:37.155
coordinate multiple agents to

1938
00:40:37.155 --> 00:40:38.074
get this done by

1939
00:40:38.074 --> 00:40:39.293
using the system prompt

1940
00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:39.994
and by building a

1941
00:40:39.994 --> 00:40:42.032
custom agent, every unique

1942
00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:43.711
version can come right

1943
00:40:43.891 --> 00:40:44.831
out of this one

1944
00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:46.030
agent. And that means

1945
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.170
that it has all

1946
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.030
that context, right? It

1947
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.768
has those tokens inside

1948
00:40:49.768 --> 00:40:50.509
of its context window.

1949
00:40:50.509 --> 00:40:51.427
So when it's generating

1950
00:40:51.427 --> 00:40:52.648
the unique versions, it

1951
00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:54.628
can generate them properly.

1952
00:40:54.648 --> 00:40:55.347
And you know, I

1953
00:40:55.347 --> 00:40:56.068
left another bug in

1954
00:40:56.068 --> 00:40:57.367
here, my bad. Let's

1955
00:40:57.367 --> 00:40:58.427
just search for three.

1956
00:40:58.547 --> 00:40:59.007
Okay, there we go.

1957
00:40:59.007 --> 00:40:59.447
So that was the

1958
00:40:59.447 --> 00:41:00.226
last one. So here
