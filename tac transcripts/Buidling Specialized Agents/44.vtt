1014
00:21:59.757 --> 00:22:00.836
a script this is

1015
00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:02.576
a stream handler so

1016
00:22:02.576 --> 00:22:03.195
we're looking at the

1017
00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:04.955
blue sky fire hose

1018
00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:06.615
web socket it's blasting

1019
00:22:06.615 --> 00:22:07.555
out events to this

1020
00:22:07.575 --> 00:22:08.615
service from this web

1021
00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:09.374
socket and then we're

1022
00:22:09.374 --> 00:22:11.313
looking for specific keywords.

1023
00:22:11.313 --> 00:22:11.971
This is just a

1024
00:22:11.971 --> 00:22:12.931
terminus of code, right?

1025
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:13.809
That's not new. That's

1026
00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:14.928
not interesting. This is

1027
00:22:14.928 --> 00:22:16.205
a simple string contains

1028
00:22:16.205 --> 00:22:17.244
check, but what is

1029
00:22:17.244 --> 00:22:18.902
interesting here, our agent

1030
00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:19.820
is now going to

1031
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.199
pick up the keywords

1032
00:22:21.478 --> 00:22:22.018
and then run a

1033
00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:24.115
sentiment analysis. So check

1034
00:22:24.115 --> 00:22:25.766
this out. Claude Code,

1035
00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:28.065
integration news, Zencoder adding

1036
00:22:28.065 --> 00:22:29.404
support for Claude Code

1037
00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:30.804
and other CLI coding
