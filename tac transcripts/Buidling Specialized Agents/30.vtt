668
00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.423
Most agents for engineers

669
00:15:01.423 --> 00:15:02.783
will be deployed in

670
00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:04.003
a script somewhere, but

671
00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.102
you can also use

672
00:15:05.263 --> 00:15:07.422
agents in terminal UIs,

673
00:15:07.442 --> 00:15:08.140
right? You can build

674
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.581
up your own personalized

675
00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:10.980
version of really any

676
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.698
terminal based application. And

677
00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:13.399
then of course, as

678
00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:14.518
we'll progress, you can

679
00:15:14.518 --> 00:15:15.957
build up full agents

680
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.797
as backend methods and

681
00:15:17.797 --> 00:15:19.235
as data streamers and

682
00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:21.495
data Anyway, let's focus

683
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.615
here, calculator agent. Let's

684
00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:23.774
do some calculations, right?

685
00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:26.474
55 Fahrenheit to Celsius.

686
00:15:26.573 --> 00:15:27.514
So we have the

687
00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:28.592
converter here. It is

688
00:15:28.592 --> 00:15:29.452
converted that for us,

689
00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:30.192
right? So user prompt
