2666
00:54:59.719 --> 00:55:01.139
chunks, right? So we're

2667
00:55:01.139 --> 00:55:03.059
just incrementing 45 through

2668
00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:03.978
50. If we go

2669
00:55:03.978 --> 00:55:04.657
back up, you can

2670
00:55:04.657 --> 00:55:06.456
see 40 through 45,

2671
00:55:06.456 --> 00:55:07.936
35 through 40. So

2672
00:55:07.936 --> 00:55:09.436
we are reading just

2673
00:55:09.456 --> 00:55:10.295
a few lines and

2674
00:55:10.295 --> 00:55:11.614
processing just a few

2675
00:55:11.614 --> 00:55:12.893
lines. We're not overwhelming

2676
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:14.253
our agents. We're constantly

2677
00:55:14.253 --> 00:55:15.552
thinking from our agent's

2678
00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:16.693
perspective. And you can

2679
00:55:16.693 --> 00:55:17.572
see here, here's how

2680
00:55:17.572 --> 00:55:18.411
we're doing it. We're

2681
00:55:18.411 --> 00:55:20.010
processing that very quickly

2682
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:21.070
using a sub process

2683
00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.369
command. And that just

2684
00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:23.090
gets the work done

2685
00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:24.108
for us on this

2686
00:55:24.108 --> 00:55:25.088
file, cleaning up old

2687
00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.208
cache entries, so on

2688
00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:26.788
and so forth. All

2689
00:55:26.867 --> 00:55:27.608
right, feel free to

2690
00:55:27.827 --> 00:55:28.407
dive into the code

2691
00:55:28.407 --> 00:55:29.226
more. I just wanna

2692
00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:30.186
point out this fact
