2265
00:46:59.498 --> 00:47:00.639
else. So we're making

2266
00:47:00.639 --> 00:47:02.077
sure with permission checks

2267
00:47:02.077 --> 00:47:03.318
via hooks. You saw

2268
00:47:03.318 --> 00:47:04.916
that throughout, write aloud

2269
00:47:04.916 --> 00:47:06.655
when our spec was

2270
00:47:06.655 --> 00:47:07.516
trying to get written

2271
00:47:07.655 --> 00:47:08.376
right here, right? And

2272
00:47:08.376 --> 00:47:08.815
we can of course

2273
00:47:08.815 --> 00:47:09.534
open up the spec.

2274
00:47:09.534 --> 00:47:10.074
It should just be

2275
00:47:10.074 --> 00:47:11.394
in the specs directory

2276
00:47:11.394 --> 00:47:11.655
right here. There we

2277
00:47:11.655 --> 00:47:12.235
go. And you can

2278
00:47:12.235 --> 00:47:12.974
see exactly what this

2279
00:47:12.974 --> 00:47:13.534
is, right? So it

2280
00:47:13.534 --> 00:47:14.414
just wrote up this

2281
00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:15.994
nice spec here. This

2282
00:47:15.994 --> 00:47:17.373
is a plan. So

2283
00:47:17.373 --> 00:47:18.152
it doesn't really follow

2284
00:47:18.152 --> 00:47:19.713
any traditional prompt engineering,

2285
00:47:19.813 --> 00:47:21.452
agentic prompt engineering structure,

2286
00:47:21.452 --> 00:47:21.831
but this is just

2287
00:47:21.831 --> 00:47:22.391
a plan to get

2288
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.311
work done, right? It's

2289
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:24.291
a plan to operate

2290
00:47:24.291 --> 00:47:25.072
and ship. You can

2291
00:47:25.072 --> 00:47:25.951
see here, probably a

2292
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:27.771
little bit overkill, 175

2293
00:47:27.771 --> 00:47:28.791
lines, but still good

2294
00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:29.389
to have, right? We

2295
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:30.130
have a full plan.
