WEBVTT

1985
00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:31.565
So response format, multi-version

1986
00:41:31.565 --> 00:41:32.784
copy response, you can

1987
00:41:32.784 --> 00:41:33.585
see it right here.

1988
00:41:33.644 --> 00:41:34.804
We're of course processing

1989
00:41:34.804 --> 00:41:35.684
this, copying it out

1990
00:41:35.684 --> 00:41:36.382
when the time is

1991
00:41:36.382 --> 00:41:37.902
right. So this is

1992
00:41:37.902 --> 00:41:39.121
that agent. There's really

1993
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:40.021
not much else going

1994
00:41:40.021 --> 00:41:40.800
on here. We are

1995
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.280
starting to deploy agents

1996
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.820
in user interfaces as

1997
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.858
backend API methods, right?

1998
00:41:45.858 --> 00:41:46.978
This is all called

1999
00:41:46.978 --> 00:41:48.137
from, we should get

2000
00:41:48.137 --> 00:41:49.717
like slash something, yeah,

2001
00:41:49.717 --> 00:41:51.335
slash copy returns multiple

2002
00:41:51.335 --> 00:41:53.215
copy variations. And so

2003
00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:53.876
you can just trace

2004
00:41:53.876 --> 00:41:55.275
all this back, await,

2005
00:41:55.275 --> 00:41:56.596
generate copy, blah, blah,

2006
00:41:56.596 --> 00:41:57.695
blah, blah, all set

2007
00:41:57.695 --> 00:41:58.596
up. And at some

2008
00:41:58.596 --> 00:41:59.315
point we're going to

2009
00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:00.295
get to the most
