143
00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:00.706
here? Let's ask it

144
00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:01.985
what's happening. Can you

145
00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:03.884
do anything other than

146
00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:05.344
Pong? Okay, there's a

147
00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:07.144
user prompt and okay.

148
00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:09.782
So all this agent

149
00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.425
does is Pong. type

150
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:11.925
one more here. I'm

151
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:12.544
just going to write

152
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.484
king. This silly agent

153
00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:16.382
encapsulates the most important

154
00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:18.201
concept when you're building

155
00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:19.841
custom agents. No matter

156
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:20.759
what we prompt here,

157
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.819
the response is always

158
00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:22.798
pong. Why is that?

159
00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:23.759
Let's dive into this

160
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.978
file. So the first

161
00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:26.596
most important concept is

162
00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:27.675
none other than the

163
00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.016
system prompt. We are

164
00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:29.954
using the Claude Code

165
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:31.293
SDK and we're setting
