1686
00:35:29.525 --> 00:35:30.465
do. These just point

1687
00:35:30.485 --> 00:35:31.945
to specific methods. And

1688
00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:32.983
then in pre-tool use,

1689
00:35:32.983 --> 00:35:33.744
this is where things

1690
00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:35.641
interesting hooks. Of course,

1691
00:35:35.641 --> 00:35:37.101
we're just logging usage,

1692
00:35:37.121 --> 00:35:38.159
but here in our

1693
00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:39.438
hook matcher, when we

1694
00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:40.858
match the read command,

1695
00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:43.324
block environment variable files.

1696
00:35:43.405 --> 00:35:43.965
All right, we don't

1697
00:35:43.965 --> 00:35:44.563
want this to happen.

1698
00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:44.943
And we can of

1699
00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:46.083
course just test this,

1700
00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:47.282
read the dot in

1701
00:35:47.282 --> 00:35:48.822
file, right? And pay

1702
00:35:48.822 --> 00:35:49.601
attention to what happens

1703
00:35:49.601 --> 00:35:50.681
here. Our agent is

1704
00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.981
going to think, but

1705
00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:52.980
there we go, blocked

1706
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.599
access to this environment

1707
00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:55.219
variable. It tried to

1708
00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:56.199
read the sample, which

1709
00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:57.378
we should allow, but

1710
00:35:57.378 --> 00:35:58.637
this custom agent doesn't

1711
00:35:58.637 --> 00:36:00.336
care. It blocks everything.
