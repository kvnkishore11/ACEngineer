600
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:30.421
Next, we have the

601
00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:31.841
calc agent, very similar

602
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:32.759
structure. You can see

603
00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:34.558
we're consistently using that

604
00:13:34.558 --> 00:13:35.878
prompts directory. Let's get

605
00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:36.857
a little meta. As

606
00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:37.357
I was working on

607
00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:38.736
this and building this,

608
00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:39.797
right, all these agents

609
00:13:39.797 --> 00:13:41.596
with agents, I'm using

610
00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:42.855
a leverage point of

611
00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.553
agentic coding, I'm using

612
00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:47.601
consistent codebase architecture

613
00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:48.620
you can see same

614
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.500
structure same format we

615
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.100
have that prompts directory

616
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.620
and every one of

617
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.900
our custom agents we're

618
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.980
being consistent with our

619
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.960
codebase it's easy

620
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.759
for us to read

621
00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:57.419
it's easy for our

622
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:58.899
team to read and

623
00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:00.580
it's easy most importantly
