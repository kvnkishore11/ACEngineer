759
00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:01.022
tools, again, function name,

760
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:02.562
and params only. So

761
00:17:02.562 --> 00:17:03.562
our agent is going

762
00:17:03.562 --> 00:17:04.141
to think a little

763
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:04.881
bit and give us

764
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:05.980
this response. There it

765
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.780
is. There is our

766
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.300
exact tools. Okay. So

767
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.740
you can see here

768
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.759
we have this big

769
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.880
disallow tools block. Our

770
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.900
agent is specifically not

771
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.838
allowed to use these

772
00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:17.019
tools. These tools do

773
00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:18.358
not end up in

774
00:17:18.358 --> 00:17:19.798
its context window. Very

775
00:17:19.798 --> 00:17:20.699
important. This is not

776
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:21.817
an option, right? There's

777
00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:22.917
no read option for

778
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:23.758
it anymore. They can't

779
00:17:23.758 --> 00:17:25.317
see this. Okay. You

780
00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:26.296
always have to adopt

781
00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.394
your agent's perspective. The

782
00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:28.773
Claude Code options is

783
00:17:28.773 --> 00:17:30.612
how you understand your
