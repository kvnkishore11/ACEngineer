1293
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:30.890
workflow right inside the

1294
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.028
system prompt. Why is

1295
00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:32.808
that? It's because we

1296
00:27:32.808 --> 00:27:34.166
always want this agent

1297
00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:35.586
to do the same

1298
00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:37.423
thing over and over,

1299
00:27:37.703 --> 00:27:38.823
okay? So you can

1300
00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:39.882
embed workflows in your

1301
00:27:39.882 --> 00:27:41.020
system prompt if you're

1302
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.199
sure that that is

1303
00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:42.798
what you want to

1304
00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:44.757
happen every single time

1305
00:27:44.757 --> 00:27:46.236
your agent executes, all

1306
00:27:46.236 --> 00:27:47.214
right? The Claude Code

1307
00:27:47.214 --> 00:27:48.628
system prompt does not

1308
00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:49.748
have a workflow like

1309
00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.626
this because it's a

1310
00:27:50.626 --> 00:27:53.701
generic multi-purpose engineering agent.

1311
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:54.621
But we're building a

1312
00:27:54.621 --> 00:27:55.819
social hype agent, right?

1313
00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:56.857
We have a specific

1314
00:27:56.857 --> 00:27:58.195
use case, a specific

1315
00:27:58.316 --> 00:27:59.634
domain problem, and we

1316
00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:00.752
know the workflow. So
