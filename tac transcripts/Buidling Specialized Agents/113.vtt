2743
00:56:29.331 --> 00:56:30.030
user prompt. And we're

2744
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:30.630
showing it how to

2745
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.731
produce the right log

2746
00:56:31.731 --> 00:56:32.590
formats. You can see

2747
00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:33.510
exactly what this looks

2748
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:34.869
like, capture the information

2749
00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:35.690
that you care about,

2750
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:36.730
and then pass it

2751
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.849
onto the tool. All

2752
00:56:37.949 --> 00:56:38.909
right, there's that workflow,

2753
00:56:38.909 --> 00:56:39.409
right? So we're just

2754
00:56:39.409 --> 00:56:40.268
being super clear about

2755
00:56:40.268 --> 00:56:41.809
what's next. So this

2756
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:42.827
is our stream agent.

2757
00:56:42.827 --> 00:56:43.588
We also have our

2758
00:56:43.588 --> 00:56:45.547
inspector agent. This agent

2759
00:56:45.748 --> 00:56:47.806
operates on the logs,

2760
00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:48.746
right? It operates on

2761
00:56:48.746 --> 00:56:50.146
the logs produced by

2762
00:56:50.146 --> 00:56:51.306
our stream agent. So

2763
00:56:51.306 --> 00:56:52.505
we're gonna read produced

2764
00:56:52.565 --> 00:56:54.210
log entries. Same kind

2765
00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.509
of format, right? Whatever

2766
00:56:55.509 --> 00:56:56.768
we prompted to read,

2767
00:56:56.768 --> 00:56:57.688
start index and end

2768
00:56:57.688 --> 00:56:58.887
index, as you saw

2769
00:56:58.887 --> 00:56:59.567
here, and it looks

2770
00:56:59.567 --> 00:57:00.186
like we ran into
