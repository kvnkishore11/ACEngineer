2512
00:51:59.146 --> 00:52:00.085
application where we have

2513
00:52:00.085 --> 00:52:01.505
agents working for us.

2514
00:52:01.565 --> 00:52:03.903
Alert support about issue

2515
00:52:04.184 --> 00:52:05.382
number four. While we're

2516
00:52:05.382 --> 00:52:06.083
doing this, you can

2517
00:52:06.083 --> 00:52:07.003
see another high issue

2518
00:52:07.003 --> 00:52:07.581
is gonna come in

2519
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:08.541
here. Our agent is

2520
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:09.601
gonna let us know

2521
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.420
that there's a new

2522
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.581
alert. So there's another

2523
00:52:11.581 --> 00:52:12.119
issue for us to

2524
00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:13.019
process. But you can

2525
00:52:13.019 --> 00:52:13.800
see here, right, we

2526
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.139
have notified our support

2527
00:52:15.159 --> 00:52:16.099
team about this issue,

2528
00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:17.079
okay? You can imagine

2529
00:52:17.197 --> 00:52:18.878
your support has this,

2530
00:52:18.978 --> 00:52:19.418
And it's the other

2531
00:52:19.418 --> 00:52:20.416
way around, right? Support's

2532
00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:21.317
letting the engineering team

2533
00:52:21.317 --> 00:52:22.516
know, engineering teams letting

2534
00:52:22.516 --> 00:52:24.056
PM know, whatever. You

2535
00:52:24.056 --> 00:52:24.954
can literally do anything

2536
00:52:24.954 --> 00:52:25.554
under the sun. The

2537
00:52:25.554 --> 00:52:26.673
important thing here is

2538
00:52:26.673 --> 00:52:27.914
we have two agents

2539
00:52:27.954 --> 00:52:29.172
helping us operate a

2540
00:52:29.172 --> 00:52:31.371
stream of important information,
