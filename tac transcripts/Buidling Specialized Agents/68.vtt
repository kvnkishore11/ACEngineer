1611
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.529
knows how to respond.

1612
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:01.210
Okay, so that's the

1613
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.289
system prompt. So in

1614
00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:03.209
our loud tools, you

1615
00:34:03.209 --> 00:34:04.188
can see we aren't

1616
00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:05.508
creating an MCP server,

1617
00:34:05.508 --> 00:34:07.027
but we are extending

1618
00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:07.707
it, right? We have

1619
00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:09.465
this MCP config path.

1620
00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:10.284
This is super important.

1621
00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:10.644
Let's go ahead and

1622
00:34:10.644 --> 00:34:11.505
look at this. We

1623
00:34:11.505 --> 00:34:13.304
are actually referencing this

1624
00:34:13.304 --> 00:34:14.483
fire call MCP server.

1625
00:34:14.483 --> 00:34:14.802
And I think this

1626
00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:16.818
is actually 6K. tokens

1627
00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:18.637
consumed, fire crawl, 6K.

1628
00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:20.456
And our agent is

1629
00:34:20.456 --> 00:34:21.556
indeed referencing that. So

1630
00:34:21.556 --> 00:34:21.996
if we just search

1631
00:34:21.996 --> 00:34:23.275
for fire crawl, you

1632
00:34:23.275 --> 00:34:24.275
can see this right

1633
00:34:24.275 --> 00:34:26.114
here, load MCP config,

1634
00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:27.574
there's that MCP config

1635
00:34:27.614 --> 00:34:28.634
path. And then we

1636
00:34:28.634 --> 00:34:29.994
are just checking that

1637
00:34:29.994 --> 00:34:31.632
we're adding an MCP
