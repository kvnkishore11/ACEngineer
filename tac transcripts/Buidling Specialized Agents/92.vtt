2211
00:45:59.385 --> 00:46:00.503
probably stop watching this

2212
00:46:00.503 --> 00:46:01.601
video immediately and finish

2213
00:46:01.601 --> 00:46:02.460
TAC. It's all about

2214
00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:03.699
transitioning from in loop

2215
00:46:03.699 --> 00:46:05.114
to out loop. to

2216
00:46:05.114 --> 00:46:07.793
eventually ZTE. We have

2217
00:46:07.793 --> 00:46:08.751
a couple of cool

2218
00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:09.512
things to point out.

2219
00:46:09.512 --> 00:46:11.371
So seven slash main,

2220
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:12.510
let's get into custom

2221
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.030
micro seven and just

2222
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.668
collapse, right? Let's understand

2223
00:46:15.668 --> 00:46:16.768
this at a fundamental

2224
00:46:16.788 --> 00:46:17.608
level, scroll to the

2225
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.226
bottom here, 400 lines

2226
00:46:19.226 --> 00:46:20.106
front end. And I

2227
00:46:20.106 --> 00:46:20.487
think we have a

2228
00:46:20.487 --> 00:46:21.405
couple additional files here.

2229
00:46:21.405 --> 00:46:21.885
Yeah, we have our

2230
00:46:21.885 --> 00:46:23.925
modules, agent orchestrator and

2231
00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:24.905
just a config file,

2232
00:46:24.905 --> 00:46:25.483
right? I don't think

2233
00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:25.744
any of this here

2234
00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:27.123
is interesting. What is

2235
00:46:27.123 --> 00:46:28.643
interesting is the agent

2236
00:46:28.643 --> 00:46:29.722
orchestrator. So let's come

2237
00:46:29.722 --> 00:46:30.702
in here and let's
