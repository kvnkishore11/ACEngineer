380
00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:00.755
do whatever you want

381
00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:01.456
to do inside of

382
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:02.196
your tool. Here we

383
00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:04.075
step back into traditional

384
00:09:04.075 --> 00:09:05.634
deterministic code, right? It's

385
00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:06.394
a tool call. Do

386
00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:07.673
whatever you want, but

387
00:09:07.712 --> 00:09:08.851
be sure to respond

388
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.192
in the proper format.

389
00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:10.870
You can see here,

390
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.030
here's our log. Here's

391
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.230
the transforms we were

392
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.970
doing, right? Just a

393
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.708
small example tool call

394
00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:16.629
for our agent. This

395
00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:17.827
is a custom agent

396
00:09:17.827 --> 00:09:18.648
with a custom custom

397
00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:19.607
tool set. Now, something

398
00:09:19.607 --> 00:09:21.067
interesting here as well,

399
00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:21.886
you can see we're

400
00:09:21.886 --> 00:09:23.966
running Claude Haiku. We

401
00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:25.265
have downgraded our model

402
00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.385
to a cheaper, less

403
00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.184
intelligent, but much faster

404
00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:29.304
model, right? This is

405
00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:30.404
a simple agent. It
