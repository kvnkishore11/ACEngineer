580
00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:00.484
it is important to

581
00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:02.482
mention you can append

582
00:13:02.503 --> 00:13:03.857
system prompt. Right, you

583
00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:05.136
can just add on

584
00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:06.115
to what's already there.

585
00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:07.414
This is also powerful.

586
00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:08.355
This is more of

587
00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.673
a way to extend

588
00:13:09.673 --> 00:13:11.851
Claude Code versus overwrite

589
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:12.792
it and build a

590
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.191
true custom agent, right?

591
00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:15.649
Let's continue, let's progress,

592
00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:16.908
let's get more control

593
00:13:16.908 --> 00:13:18.368
over agents. Let's scale

594
00:13:18.368 --> 00:13:19.147
this up and let's

595
00:13:19.147 --> 00:13:20.006
look at a new

596
00:13:20.186 --> 00:13:22.144
form factor for agents

597
00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:23.524
because right now all

598
00:13:23.524 --> 00:13:24.582
we're doing is firing

599
00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:26.621
off one off scripts.

600
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:30.421
Next, we have the
