1711
00:35:58.637 --> 00:36:00.336
care. It blocks everything.

1712
00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:01.197
All right, so now

1713
00:36:01.197 --> 00:36:02.255
it's just reporting that.

1714
00:36:02.436 --> 00:36:03.115
And yeah, so it

1715
00:36:03.115 --> 00:36:03.795
can see its own

1716
00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:05.114
code. So it's spoiling

1717
00:36:05.114 --> 00:36:06.014
the fun here, but

1718
00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:06.753
you can see there

1719
00:36:06.813 --> 00:36:08.713
our hook blocked reading

1720
00:36:08.753 --> 00:36:09.773
dot M in the

1721
00:36:09.773 --> 00:36:11.391
file path, right? blocked

1722
00:36:11.391 --> 00:36:12.429
it completely and we

1723
00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:13.807
gave it a concise

1724
00:36:13.807 --> 00:36:15.485
response format telling it

1725
00:36:15.485 --> 00:36:16.625
exactly why it was

1726
00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.543
blocked, all right? And

1727
00:36:17.543 --> 00:36:18.862
then we have warnings

1728
00:36:18.862 --> 00:36:19.780
for other types of

1729
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.597
files. You can do

1730
00:36:21.697 --> 00:36:22.378
anything you want in

1731
00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:23.237
your hook file, much

1732
00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:24.117
like you can with

1733
00:36:24.117 --> 00:36:24.737
your tools. But this

1734
00:36:24.737 --> 00:36:25.715
is important. You can

1735
00:36:25.715 --> 00:36:26.795
tap into the hook

1736
00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:29.014
capabilities with your custom

1737
00:36:29.074 --> 00:36:29.813
agents. You can see

1738
00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.054
here, this is essential
