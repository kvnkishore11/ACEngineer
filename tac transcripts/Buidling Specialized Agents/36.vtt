807
00:17:58.124 --> 00:18:00.083
custom agents at large,

808
00:18:00.123 --> 00:18:01.501
right? The big idea,

809
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:02.981
the abstract idea. So

810
00:18:03.142 --> 00:18:03.840
you can see here,

811
00:18:03.861 --> 00:18:04.461
right? We have our

812
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:05.619
disallowed tools there. That's

813
00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:06.519
great. We have our

814
00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.660
system prompt, all right?

815
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:07.999
So we have our

816
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.278
calculator prompt. Again, system

817
00:18:10.278 --> 00:18:12.157
prompt, full overwrite, right?

818
00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:13.257
This is not Cloud

819
00:18:13.277 --> 00:18:14.296
Code anymore. We have

820
00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:15.215
the model and then

821
00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:16.494
we have a resume,

822
00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:17.255
right? We were passing

823
00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.753
back in the current

824
00:18:18.753 --> 00:18:20.134
session ID. This is

825
00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:20.873
important. We have a

826
00:18:20.873 --> 00:18:21.472
couple of tools here.

827
00:18:21.492 --> 00:18:21.972
Let's just go ahead

828
00:18:21.972 --> 00:18:22.971
and quickly understand our

829
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:24.471
tools, quickly collapse everything.

830
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:25.371
You can see everything

831
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:25.951
in this file, we

832
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.250
have 400 lines. In

833
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.789
the calculate expression, you

834
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:30.028
can see just based
