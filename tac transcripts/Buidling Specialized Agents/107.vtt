WEBVTT

2591
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.121
have custom agents, right?

2592
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:30.880
From the ground up,

2593
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.900
these are full custom

2594
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.159
agents. We have the

2595
00:53:33.159 --> 00:53:34.318
system prompt, which I

2596
00:53:34.318 --> 00:53:35.197
always recommend you throw

2597
00:53:35.197 --> 00:53:36.057
the system prompt at

2598
00:53:36.057 --> 00:53:36.717
the top here. So

2599
00:53:36.717 --> 00:53:37.097
I'm going to move

2600
00:53:37.097 --> 00:53:38.456
that. System prompts, we've

2601
00:53:38.456 --> 00:53:40.376
disallowed every other tool,

2602
00:53:40.376 --> 00:53:41.375
right? This is not

2603
00:53:41.414 --> 00:53:42.735
a Claude Code agent

2604
00:53:42.735 --> 00:53:43.313
at all. We don't

2605
00:53:43.313 --> 00:53:44.153
need those tools at

2606
00:53:44.153 --> 00:53:45.393
all. We need our

2607
00:53:45.393 --> 00:53:46.853
specific tools, all right?

2608
00:53:46.853 --> 00:53:47.891
So here's our stream

2609
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:48.972
agent and check out

2610
00:53:48.972 --> 00:53:49.510
what this can do.

2611
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.210
Read stream file, produce

2612
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.242
summarize log, create alert.

2613
00:53:53.242 --> 00:53:54.221
This agent is just

2614
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.199
constantly processing these log

2615
00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.798
messages for us. Summarizing,

2616
00:53:57.798 --> 00:53:59.338
it's pulling important information.

2617
00:53:59.338 --> 00:53:59.938
It's letting us know

2618
00:53:59.938 --> 00:54:00.777
if there are issues
