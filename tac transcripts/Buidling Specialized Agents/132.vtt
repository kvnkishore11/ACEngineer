3220
01:05:59.777 --> 01:06:00.496
gonna be available to

3221
01:06:00.496 --> 01:06:01.596
you. Every agent you

3222
01:06:01.596 --> 01:06:02.775
saw here is gonna

3223
01:06:02.775 --> 01:06:03.494
be in the apps

3224
01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:05.333
directory waiting for you

3225
01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:06.074
to dig in and

3226
01:06:06.114 --> 01:06:06.873
understand how you can

3227
01:06:06.873 --> 01:06:08.052
build out custom agents

3228
01:06:08.052 --> 01:06:08.992
from zero in a

3229
01:06:08.992 --> 01:06:10.472
simple script all the

3230
01:06:10.472 --> 01:06:11.811
way up to complex

3231
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:14.369
multi-agent user interfaces that

3232
01:06:14.369 --> 01:06:15.769
help you control your

3233
01:06:15.769 --> 01:06:17.349
compute and use custom

3234
01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:18.869
agents in a better,

3235
01:06:18.929 --> 01:06:20.528
more powerful way. This

3236
01:06:20.528 --> 01:06:21.228
is a codebase

3237
01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:22.228
you're going to want

3238
01:06:22.248 --> 01:06:23.648
to ultra think about

3239
01:06:23.668 --> 01:06:24.987
and understand how you

3240
01:06:24.987 --> 01:06:26.507
can extend and use

3241
01:06:26.507 --> 01:06:27.887
the ideas we've discussed

3242
01:06:27.887 --> 01:06:29.846
here. Deploying effective compute

3243
01:06:29.846 --> 01:06:32.346
and deploying effective agents
