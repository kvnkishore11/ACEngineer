2540
00:52:29.172 --> 00:52:31.371
stream of important information,

2541
00:52:31.391 --> 00:52:32.492
helping us filter it

2542
00:52:32.512 --> 00:52:33.831
down piece by piece

2543
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:34.851
by piece. All right,

2544
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.349
how are we able

2545
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:36.489
to build this powerful,

2546
00:52:36.489 --> 00:52:37.509
rich user experience, a

2547
00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:39.568
multi-agent experience? Let's go

2548
00:52:39.568 --> 00:52:40.307
and close this. This

2549
00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:41.347
is my favorite agent

2550
00:52:41.347 --> 00:52:42.286
combination, by the way.

2551
00:52:42.306 --> 00:52:43.027
And why is that?

2552
00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:43.427
Why is this my

2553
00:52:43.427 --> 00:52:44.545
favorite? It's because it's

2554
00:52:44.565 --> 00:52:45.885
really showcasing the fact

2555
00:52:45.885 --> 00:52:47.324
that you can use

2556
00:52:47.324 --> 00:52:48.364
agents, not just in

2557
00:52:48.364 --> 00:52:50.003
UI, in operating data

2558
00:52:50.003 --> 00:52:51.601
streams. You can produce

2559
00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:53.001
outputs with one agent

2560
00:52:53.001 --> 00:52:54.001
and have other agents

2561
00:52:54.001 --> 00:52:55.059
like the inspector agent

2562
00:52:55.059 --> 00:52:56.838
consume the output as

2563
00:52:56.838 --> 00:52:57.938
its input from another

2564
00:52:57.938 --> 00:52:59.478
agent, right? There's just

2565
00:52:59.478 --> 00:53:01.097
so many multi-agent configurations
