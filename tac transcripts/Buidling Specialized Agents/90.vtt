2162
00:44:59.894 --> 00:45:01.233
UI. Then you can

2163
00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:02.034
do more than you

2164
00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:03.134
ever could before, frankly,

2165
00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:03.934
right? We have a

2166
00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.092
dedicated workflow working step

2167
00:45:06.112 --> 00:45:07.333
by step by step,

2168
00:45:07.393 --> 00:45:08.572
plan, build, review, and

2169
00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:09.411
handing it off to

2170
00:45:09.411 --> 00:45:10.431
the next stage in

2171
00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:11.670
the process, okay? You

2172
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.251
can see here our

2173
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:13.610
reviewer agent, there's all

2174
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.791
of its tools, and

2175
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:15.170
you can see it

2176
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.349
just operating, doing work

2177
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:17.230
for us, right? We're

2178
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.030
using a lot of

2179
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.568
the out-of-the-box Claude Code

2180
00:45:19.568 --> 00:45:20.708
tools, right? If you

2181
00:45:20.728 --> 00:45:21.509
don't need to reinvent

2182
00:45:21.509 --> 00:45:22.509
the wheel, don't do

2183
00:45:22.528 --> 00:45:23.128
it. Let's be super

2184
00:45:23.128 --> 00:45:24.088
clear about this. The

2185
00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.927
Claude Code, running the

2186
00:45:25.927 --> 00:45:27.905
base Claude Code agent

2187
00:45:27.985 --> 00:45:29.485
is incredible. We've been

2188
00:45:29.485 --> 00:45:30.724
using it since Claude
