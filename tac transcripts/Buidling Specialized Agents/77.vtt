1833
00:38:29.385 --> 00:38:30.704
outline with one sentence

1834
00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:32.503
and subscription each, six

1835
00:38:32.503 --> 00:38:34.041
versions to quickly look

1836
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:35.561
through and pile through

1837
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:37.019
and use for my

1838
00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:37.878
writing, right? Use for

1839
00:38:37.878 --> 00:38:39.358
my work. Just another

1840
00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:40.956
example of how you

1841
00:38:40.956 --> 00:38:43.195
can embed unique agents,

1842
00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:44.715
right? Custom agents and

1843
00:38:44.715 --> 00:38:45.554
get value out of

1844
00:38:45.554 --> 00:38:46.594
them. Check this out.

1845
00:38:46.594 --> 00:38:47.552
We have six versions.

1846
00:38:47.552 --> 00:38:48.773
It's in Markdown. So

1847
00:38:48.773 --> 00:38:49.851
of course, another place

1848
00:38:49.851 --> 00:38:50.951
to take this application.

1849
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.490
We can set up

1850
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.710
Markdown, blah, blah, blah,

1851
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.768
boring UI stuff, but

1852
00:38:53.768 --> 00:38:55.288
you understand the capability

1853
00:38:55.288 --> 00:38:56.208
here, right? You understand

1854
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.007
how powerful this can

1855
00:38:57.007 --> 00:38:57.947
be as you start

1856
00:38:57.947 --> 00:38:59.806
moving our agents into

1857
00:38:59.806 --> 00:39:00.804
UIs, right? Which will
