1264
00:26:59.354 --> 00:27:00.193
updated. This is not

1265
00:27:00.193 --> 00:27:00.854
a user prompt. This

1266
00:27:00.854 --> 00:27:01.952
is a system prompt.

1267
00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:02.972
This is the law

1268
00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:04.931
for the agent. always

1269
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.210
run with this exact

1270
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.170
same setup. We're going

1271
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:07.669
to do a quick

1272
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:08.708
replace on this. You

1273
00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:09.468
can just search this

1274
00:27:09.468 --> 00:27:10.467
and see exactly where

1275
00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:11.665
that's happening. Load system

1276
00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:12.924
prompt. Let's move into

1277
00:27:12.924 --> 00:27:13.704
this. And then we

1278
00:27:13.704 --> 00:27:15.083
have that getting templated

1279
00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:15.942
right there. Right? So

1280
00:27:15.942 --> 00:27:16.602
exactly as you would

1281
00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:17.601
expect inside of our

1282
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:18.300
utils, we have a

1283
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.359
little bit more structure

1284
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.199
in this codebase.

1285
00:27:20.199 --> 00:27:20.699
All right. We have

1286
00:27:20.778 --> 00:27:21.597
a nice set of

1287
00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:22.977
instructions. All right. So

1288
00:27:22.977 --> 00:27:23.557
we can just collapse

1289
00:27:23.557 --> 00:27:24.215
at the third level

1290
00:27:24.215 --> 00:27:25.355
here. And we also

1291
00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:26.973
have a workflow. Now,

1292
00:27:27.074 --> 00:27:28.971
Controversially, we're putting the

1293
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:30.890
workflow right inside the
