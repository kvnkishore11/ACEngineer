623
00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:00.580
it's easy most importantly

624
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.500
for our agents to

625
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.278
read let's run the

626
00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:03.599
calc agent and understand

627
00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:04.479
what this does for

628
00:14:04.479 --> 00:14:05.139
us by the way

629
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.698
uvr is uv run

630
00:14:06.698 --> 00:14:07.399
i'll be using this

631
00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:08.798
as a shorthand calc

632
00:14:09.258 --> 00:14:10.798
agent py kick it

633
00:14:10.798 --> 00:14:12.038
off and What do

634
00:14:12.038 --> 00:14:12.898
we have here? Our

635
00:14:12.898 --> 00:14:14.417
calc agent puts the

636
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:15.596
custom agent in a

637
00:14:15.596 --> 00:14:17.275
different form factor. One

638
00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:18.556
you're familiar with the

639
00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:19.894
terminal UI. Let's just

640
00:14:19.894 --> 00:14:21.294
start by asking what

641
00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:22.573
tools do you have

642
00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:24.254
available? So there's a

643
00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:25.193
user prompt. And of

644
00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:26.113
course we're not going

645
00:14:26.113 --> 00:14:27.072
to get a agent

646
00:14:27.072 --> 00:14:28.212
response here. Gave us

647
00:14:28.212 --> 00:14:29.751
this long response, show

648
00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:31.491
tool names only. Okay.
