00:31:56.993 --> 00:32:00.371
agent dedicated, specialized for

1519
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:02.630
operating this small code

1520
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.209
base right here. Okay,

1521
00:32:04.209 --> 00:32:04.867
how does this work?

1522
00:32:05.147 --> 00:32:06.386
QA agent, let's open

1523
00:32:06.386 --> 00:32:07.445
it up. Let's collapse

1524
00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:08.026
everything that's got a

1525
00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.924
high level view, 570

1526
00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:11.523
lines, main. You can

1527
00:32:11.523 --> 00:32:12.702
always just look and

1528
00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:13.801
search for the key

1529
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:14.980
pieces of information. We

1530
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.941
don't have any tools,

1531
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:16.980
so no custom tools

1532
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.798
here, but we can

1533
00:32:17.798 --> 00:32:19.837
of course search Claude

1534
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.970
and we're taken right

1535
00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:24.749
to the most important

1536
00:32:24.749 --> 00:32:26.009
element of Claude Code

1537
00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:27.009
custom agents using the

1538
00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:28.189
Claude Code SDK. We

1539
00:32:28.189 --> 00:32:29.669
have the options, right?

1540
00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:30.308
This is where we
