355
00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:31.002
SDK MCP server, and

356
00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:31.783
we're passing in a

357
00:08:31.783 --> 00:08:33.022
single tool. So this

358
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:34.902
builds an entire MCP

359
00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:36.640
server in memory for

360
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.600
our agent. This is

361
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.820
super powerful. So let's

362
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.418
look at our echo

363
00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.519
tool and understand what

364
00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:41.918
it does. Tools for

365
00:08:41.918 --> 00:08:42.937
your Claude Code SDK,

366
00:08:42.937 --> 00:08:43.976
they're built like this,

367
00:08:43.976 --> 00:08:44.996
a decorator. We then

368
00:08:44.996 --> 00:08:45.975
have the name, we

369
00:08:45.975 --> 00:08:47.370
have the description, So

370
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:48.442
keep in mind, The

371
00:08:48.442 --> 00:08:49.721
description of your tool

372
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:51.140
tells your agent how

373
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.960
to use it in

374
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.320
addition to the actual

375
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.958
parameters that get passed

376
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.158
into your tool. In

377
00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:57.238
the actual arguments, you

378
00:08:57.238 --> 00:08:58.017
just pass in a

379
00:08:58.017 --> 00:08:59.197
dict and then you

380
00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:00.755
do whatever you want
