2344
00:48:29.652 --> 00:48:31.211
the title, the purpose,

2345
00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:33.590
variables, instructions, workflow, report,

2346
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.010
so on and so

2347
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.710
forth. We're not gonna

2348
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.471
dive into these, we

2349
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:36.550
gotta keep moving, but

2350
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:37.869
you can guess how

2351
00:48:37.869 --> 00:48:39.230
the other agents look,

2352
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:40.130
right? If we just

2353
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.141
search this, We have

2354
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:42.440
another agent here. This

2355
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.460
is our builder and

2356
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.338
we don't need to

2357
00:48:44.338 --> 00:48:45.958
modify anything here, right?

2358
00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:46.597
We don't have a

2359
00:48:46.597 --> 00:48:47.815
new system prompt. We

2360
00:48:47.815 --> 00:48:49.235
are using the Claude

2361
00:48:49.235 --> 00:48:50.793
Code engineering agent, all

2362
00:48:50.793 --> 00:48:51.793
right? So, you know,

2363
00:48:51.853 --> 00:48:52.851
don't feel pressured to

2364
00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:54.471
overwrite the system prompt.

2365
00:48:54.471 --> 00:48:54.849
So here we have

2366
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:55.889
the model, current working

2367
00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:57.708
directory, permission mode. We're

2368
00:48:57.708 --> 00:48:59.206
letting our builder agent

2369
00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.085
do whatever it needs
