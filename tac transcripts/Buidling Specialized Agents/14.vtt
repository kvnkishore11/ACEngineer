279
00:06:59.396 --> 00:07:00.956
run echo agent py.

280
00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:02.016
And we're gonna see

281
00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:03.495
a similar structure, right?

282
00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:04.014
We have our echo

283
00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:05.095
agent kicking off, user

284
00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:06.653
prompt, agent response, but

285
00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:07.574
here we have something

286
00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:08.834
different. Here we have,

287
00:07:09.014 --> 00:07:10.492
of course, a custom

288
00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:11.432
tool. So our agent

289
00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:12.372
is saying, I'll use

290
00:07:12.372 --> 00:07:13.153
this tool, and then

291
00:07:13.153 --> 00:07:13.971
we have this tool

292
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.331
call block here, and

293
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:15.752
then we have the

294
00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:16.851
response of the tool

295
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.971
call, and then our

296
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.310
agent response, right? So

297
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.610
these are all unique

298
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.029
elements coming out of

299
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:23.374
our agent. You wanna

300
00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:24.452
be keeping track of

301
00:07:24.452 --> 00:07:25.413
these, right? Keep track

302
00:07:25.413 --> 00:07:26.531
of the core four.

303
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:27.872
If you understand the

304
00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:29.130
core four and how

305
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.610
each element flows and
