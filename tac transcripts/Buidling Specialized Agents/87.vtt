2082
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.507
agent running on the

2083
00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:31.228
back So let's just

2084
00:43:31.228 --> 00:43:32.547
collapse the front end

2085
00:43:32.547 --> 00:43:33.485
there and let's see

2086
00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:34.025
what our agent is

2087
00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:35.025
doing. The difference here

2088
00:43:35.025 --> 00:43:36.023
is we have a

2089
00:43:36.023 --> 00:43:38.003
multi-agent system, right? We're

2090
00:43:38.003 --> 00:43:38.882
not just deploying a

2091
00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.260
single agent anymore. We're

2092
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.639
deploying multiple agents inside

2093
00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:43.418
of our UI. So

2094
00:43:43.418 --> 00:43:44.398
now we have a

2095
00:43:44.398 --> 00:43:46.097
planner agent. It's noticing,

2096
00:43:46.097 --> 00:43:46.936
it's thinking, right? We

2097
00:43:46.936 --> 00:43:48.514
have planner thinking, planner

2098
00:43:48.614 --> 00:43:51.592
tool calls, hook, interceptions,

2099
00:43:51.813 --> 00:43:53.072
right, tool allowed, we

2100
00:43:53.072 --> 00:43:54.771
have permission system inside

2101
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:55.572
of this, it has

2102
00:43:55.572 --> 00:43:56.811
the full structure. And

2103
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:57.291
now it's gonna start

2104
00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:58.349
updating this code, right?

2105
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:59.090
It's a simple title

2106
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.429
change, this isn't rocket
