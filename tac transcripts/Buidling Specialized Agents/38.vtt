857
00:18:59.459 --> 00:19:01.817
reflect, improve, change, but

858
00:19:01.817 --> 00:19:02.817
you have to to

859
00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:04.297
give them the information,

860
00:19:04.517 --> 00:19:04.876
all right? This is

861
00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:05.955
the equivalent of the

862
00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:08.394
standard out plus tools

863
00:19:08.394 --> 00:19:09.454
in our 12 leverage

864
00:19:09.454 --> 00:19:10.413
points, right? You need

865
00:19:10.413 --> 00:19:11.354
to give your agent

866
00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:12.932
back information. If an

867
00:19:12.932 --> 00:19:14.392
error occurs, can our

868
00:19:14.392 --> 00:19:15.211
agent pivot? So this

869
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:15.771
is a question you

870
00:19:15.771 --> 00:19:16.730
can ask and build

871
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.150
in to your system

872
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.930
so that your agent

873
00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:20.292
has the information it

874
00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.232
needs to pivot to

875
00:19:21.232 --> 00:19:22.932
success within its tools,

876
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.271
within its agent loop.

877
00:19:24.311 --> 00:19:24.750
So this is our

878
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.451
tool here. And of

879
00:19:25.451 --> 00:19:25.971
course, you can see

880
00:19:25.971 --> 00:19:27.230
that down here inside

881
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.450
of our tools, inside

882
00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.868
of this in-memory MTP

883
00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:30.968
server. And these are,
