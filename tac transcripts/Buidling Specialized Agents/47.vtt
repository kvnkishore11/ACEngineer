1088
00:23:29.902 --> 00:23:31.041
an alert to us.

1089
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.961
It's a tool call,

1090
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:32.582
so you can do

1091
00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:33.800
anything you want, right?

1092
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.820
In our case, we

1093
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.401
spun up a Apple

1094
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:37.660
script that showed that

1095
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.880
notification, and then we

1096
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.960
fired off a natural

1097
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.939
language text-to-speech that just

1098
00:23:41.939 --> 00:23:43.419
spoke the title and

1099
00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:44.638
the message. So in

1100
00:23:44.638 --> 00:23:45.617
the background live, you

1101
00:23:45.617 --> 00:23:46.417
know, this service could

1102
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:47.617
be running anywhere. It

1103
00:23:47.617 --> 00:23:48.676
could be texting you.

1104
00:23:48.676 --> 00:23:49.596
It could be updating

1105
00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:50.757
a Discord, a Slack

1106
00:23:50.757 --> 00:23:52.336
group, whatever, giving critical

1107
00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:53.355
information in a live

1108
00:23:53.355 --> 00:23:54.796
fashion based on some

1109
00:23:54.855 --> 00:23:55.875
data stream, right? In

1110
00:23:55.875 --> 00:23:56.554
this case, we're just

1111
00:23:56.554 --> 00:23:57.633
quickly looking at the

1112
00:23:57.633 --> 00:23:58.633
blue sky fire hose,

1113
00:23:58.633 --> 00:23:59.271
but this could be

1114
00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:00.730
any endpoint, any web
