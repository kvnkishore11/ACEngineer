3125
01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:01.085
agents to perform better

3126
01:04:01.085 --> 01:04:01.925
than any out of

3127
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.423
the box agent can,

3128
01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.224
okay? So both of

3129
01:04:04.224 --> 01:04:04.684
those things can be

3130
01:04:04.684 --> 01:04:05.523
true. You wanna use

3131
01:04:05.523 --> 01:04:06.242
the right tool for

3132
01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.282
the job. We're just

3133
01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:08.161
doing the same thing

3134
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:10.425
over with new technology.

3135
01:04:10.425 --> 01:04:11.244
We're using the best

3136
01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.085
tool for the job

3137
01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:13.583
at hand. The agent

3138
01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.163
is compute scaled. You

3139
01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:16.222
want to know how

3140
01:04:16.222 --> 01:04:17.762
to deploy this across

3141
01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:20.380
your tools, products, services

3142
01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.760
for yourself, for your

3143
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.938
engineering work and for

3144
01:04:22.938 --> 01:04:24.458
your users and customers

3145
01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.097
and the Claude Code

3146
01:04:25.117 --> 01:04:26.757
SDK and other agent

3147
01:04:26.757 --> 01:04:28.476
SDKs that will arise,

3148
01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:29.815
right? OpenAI has their

3149
01:04:29.815 --> 01:04:30.936
own agent SDK. These
