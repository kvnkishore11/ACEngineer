00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.349
analyzing real time process

1216
00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:03.608
streaming accurate summaries classified,

1217
00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.347
determine when to warrant

1218
00:26:05.387 --> 00:26:06.748
a user notification. Okay,

1219
00:26:06.748 --> 00:26:07.727
so we're just operating

1220
00:26:07.727 --> 00:26:08.727
on a live stream

1221
00:26:08.727 --> 00:26:09.605
of data. This is

1222
00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:11.125
a data streaming agent

1223
00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:11.805
and we're doing something

1224
00:26:11.805 --> 00:26:13.483
really cool here inside

1225
00:26:13.544 --> 00:26:15.064
of our system prompt,

1226
00:26:15.064 --> 00:26:16.282
we're passing in a

1227
00:26:16.282 --> 00:26:18.142
variable much like our

1228
00:26:18.142 --> 00:26:19.261
user prompts, but of

1229
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:20.520
course these aren't running

1230
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.101
over and over and

1231
00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:22.460
over. We can't dynamically

1232
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.499
use this. So the

1233
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:24.499
moment we set this

1234
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:25.538
up, it's locked in,

1235
00:26:25.637 --> 00:26:26.837
which is perfect for

1236
00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:27.797
our use case, right?

1237
00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:28.517
As long as this

1238
00:26:28.517 --> 00:26:29.635
agent runs, I just

1239
00:26:29.635 --> 00:26:30.435
want it to look
