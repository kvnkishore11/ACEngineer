00:37:59.288 --> 00:38:00.858
lot of creating is

1809
00:38:00.858 --> 00:38:02.297

of versions we generate

1816
00:38:10.632 --> 00:38:11.132
and then we can

1817
00:38:11.132 --> 00:38:12.452
just ask for copy,

1818
00:38:12.472 --> 00:38:13.072

1819
00:38:13.072 --> 00:38:14.032
generate copy. We can

1820
00:38:14.032 --> 00:38:14.971
push it even further,
