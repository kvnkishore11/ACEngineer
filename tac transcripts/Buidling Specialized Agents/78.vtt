1857
00:38:59.806 --> 00:39:00.804
UIs, right? Which will

1858
00:39:00.824 --> 00:39:01.885
likely be where they're

1859
00:39:01.885 --> 00:39:03.543
most deployed. How does

1860
00:39:03.543 --> 00:39:04.224
this work? What is

1861
00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:05.163
going on here, right?

1862
00:39:05.163 --> 00:39:05.563
You can see our

1863
00:39:05.563 --> 00:39:06.623
costs there, not too

1864
00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:07.782
bad considering we're writing

1865
00:39:07.782 --> 00:39:09.981
six versions. Let's understand

1866
00:39:10.021 --> 00:39:11.940
our try copy agent.

1867
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.280
Perfect. We're already there.

1868
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.039
First place to go

1869
00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:15.539
is plot SDK client

1870
00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:17.918
and specifically options. This

1871
00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:19.197
is a fairly simple

1872
00:39:19.197 --> 00:39:20.336
agent. We just have

1873
00:39:20.476 --> 00:39:21.476
a system prompt, of

1874
00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:23.295
course, most important model,

1875
00:39:23.295 --> 00:39:24.496
resume ID, and then

1876
00:39:24.496 --> 00:39:26.195
we have every tool

1877
00:39:26.335 --> 00:39:27.994
disallowed. Okay. So this

1878
00:39:27.994 --> 00:39:29.954
agent can only respond

1879
00:39:29.954 --> 00:39:31.733
via its agent response.
