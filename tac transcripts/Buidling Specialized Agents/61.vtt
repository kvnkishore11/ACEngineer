1445
00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:30.929
your tools. from your

1446
00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.186
system prompt. And you

1447
00:30:32.186 --> 00:30:32.626
can see here we

1448
00:30:32.626 --> 00:30:33.724
have a new message

1449
00:30:33.724 --> 00:30:34.604
type. This is the

1450
00:30:34.604 --> 00:30:35.980
system message. So we

1451
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.059
have some really important

1452
00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:38.198
information here. You can

1453
00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:39.576
see all the tools

1454
00:30:39.635 --> 00:30:41.393
available right away. And

1455
00:30:41.432 --> 00:30:42.011
you can see our

1456
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.549
MCP server. We are

1457
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:44.969
also using the Firecrawl

1458
00:30:44.969 --> 00:30:46.028
MCP server here, right?

1459
00:30:46.028 --> 00:30:47.367
So this agent is

1460
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:49.446
connected to and runs

1461
00:30:49.446 --> 00:30:51.145
the Firecrawl MCP server.

1462
00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:52.026
So your custom agents

1463
00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:53.585
can access MCP servers

1464
00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.005
just like your in-loop

1465
00:30:55.044 --> 00:30:55.963
agents can. So you

1466
00:30:55.963 --> 00:30:56.584
can see here, it's

1467
00:30:56.584 --> 00:30:57.303
got a nice summary

1468
00:30:57.303 --> 00:30:58.303
of all the tools

1469
00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.261
show in bullets, name
