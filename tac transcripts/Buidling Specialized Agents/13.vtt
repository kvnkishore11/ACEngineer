256
00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.627
system prompt. We now

257
00:06:30.627 --> 00:06:32.108
have a new product.

258
00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:33.146
This is not clog

259
00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.865
code anymore. Okay, might

260
00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:35.485
be using the same

261
00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:37.084
model, but the system

262
00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.684
prompt is truly what

263
00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.403
builds the agent. Now,

264
00:06:40.403 --> 00:06:41.502
of course, we are

265
00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.562
still using the tools.

266
00:06:42.562 --> 00:06:43.422
That's important to call

267
00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:44.122
it here. As you'll

268
00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:45.380
see, as we progress

269
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.639
into more and more

270
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.279
capable custom agents, let's

271
00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.358
move on to our

272
00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:50.918
second agent, the Echo

273
00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:54.398
agent. Inside of our

274
00:06:54.398 --> 00:06:55.098
echo agent, you can

275
00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:56.276
see a similar structure.

276
00:06:56.297 --> 00:06:57.137
We have a single

277
00:06:57.137 --> 00:06:58.137
Python script here that

278
00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.396
we're gonna execute, uv

279
00:06:59.396 --> 00:07:00.956
run echo agent py.
