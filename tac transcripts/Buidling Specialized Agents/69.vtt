1637
00:34:29.994 --> 00:34:31.632
we're adding an MCP

1638
00:34:31.632 --> 00:34:32.373
server. So this is

1639
00:34:32.373 --> 00:34:33.911
an important capability. You

1640
00:34:33.911 --> 00:34:35.032
can build custom agents

1641
00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:35.811
and you can tap

1642
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.030
into the rich model

1643
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.010
context protocol ecosystem. A

1644
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.148
lot of the tools

1645
00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:41.248
that you'll want and

1646
00:34:41.248 --> 00:34:42.748
need already exist. We

1647
00:34:42.748 --> 00:34:43.568
have that resume so

1648
00:34:43.568 --> 00:34:45.367
we can continue conversations.

1649
00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:46.086
We have our allowed

1650
00:34:46.086 --> 00:34:47.786
tools, which are specific

1651
00:34:47.826 --> 00:34:49.625
code-based searching tools, right?

1652
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:51.304
This agent cannot write.

1653
00:34:51.304 --> 00:34:52.184
It's a QA agent.

1654
00:34:52.184 --> 00:34:52.862
Why would it need

1655
00:34:52.862 --> 00:34:54.123
to write anything? So

1656
00:34:54.123 --> 00:34:54.983
we are making that

1657
00:34:54.983 --> 00:34:56.501
clear in our tools,

1658
00:34:56.501 --> 00:34:57.260
right? Remember the core

1659
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.021
four, context, model, prompt,

1660
00:34:59.041 --> 00:35:01.099
tools, custom agents, Let
