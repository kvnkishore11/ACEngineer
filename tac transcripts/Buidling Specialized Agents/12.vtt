00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.221
handling the response of

233
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.100
the agent. And take

234
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.600
note of these specific

235
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.779
blocks that you can

236
00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:05.759
report. We have our

237
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.060
agent message blocks, we

238
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.298
have a result message,

239
00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.079
and you can parse

240
00:06:09.098 --> 00:06:10.877
specific information out of

241
00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:12.257
these as you'll see

242
00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:13.317
as we progress. But

243
00:06:13.317 --> 00:06:13.817
this is the Pong

244
00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:15.497
agent, and this showcases

245
00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:16.896
the power of the

246
00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:18.696
system prompt. Remember, all

247
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.456
that work that the

248
00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:21.255
Claude Code team has

249
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.095
put into making a

250
00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:23.595
great agent, right? The

251
00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:24.954
Claude Code agent that

252
00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:25.733
you know and love

253
00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:27.550
is now gone. Okay,

254
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.110
you have to be

255
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.249
very careful with the

256
00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.627
system prompt. We now
