WEBVTT

883
00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:30.968
server. And these are,

884
00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:31.928
of course, our only

885
00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:33.406
allowed tools. Now, we

886
00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:34.727
are using the powerful

887
00:19:34.747 --> 00:19:35.806
CloudForce Sonnet. If you're

888
00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:36.665
operating in the future,

889
00:19:36.665 --> 00:19:37.664
hopefully you have something

890
00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.085
more powerful, but don't

891
00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:40.364
let these models fool

892
00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:41.703
you. It's not the

893
00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:42.522
models that are the

894
00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:44.102
limitation, the bottleneck anymore.

895
00:19:44.102 --> 00:19:45.001
It's you and I.

896
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:45.861
It's our ability to

897
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:47.621
wield better agents, more

898
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.000
agents, and now custom

899
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.980
agents. Okay, we have

900
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.078
this new current session

901
00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:52.098
ID. This is important.

902
00:19:52.098 --> 00:19:52.739
Let's go ahead and

903
00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:54.179
understand how this works.

904
00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:54.778
And just to mention

905
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:55.538
it again, right? Same

906
00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:56.478
workflow. You set up

907
00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:57.857
your options with the

908
00:19:57.857 --> 00:19:59.196
Claude Code options. This

909
00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.696
basically configures your core
