2894
00:59:27.443 --> 00:59:30.202
domain-specific problems, better than

2895
00:59:30.202 --> 00:59:31.621
anyone with compute. If

2896
00:59:31.621 --> 00:59:32.121
you want to keep

2897
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:33.719
your costs down while

2898
00:59:33.719 --> 00:59:35.139
keeping performance up, remember

2899
00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:36.798
every prompt costs and

2900
00:59:36.798 --> 00:59:37.858
whatever's in that context

2901
00:59:37.858 --> 00:59:39.117
window on startup is

2902
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:39.956
going to cost you.

2903
00:59:40.016 --> 00:59:40.797
That goes all the

2904
00:59:40.797 --> 00:59:41.157
way down to the

2905
00:59:41.157 --> 00:59:42.076
system prompt and the

2906
00:59:42.076 --> 00:59:43.096
user prompt. And then

2907
00:59:43.096 --> 00:59:44.094
if you need permission

2908
00:59:44.094 --> 00:59:45.853
checks, custom agents allow

2909
00:59:45.853 --> 00:59:46.833
you to prevent your

2910
00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:48.233
compute from destroying your

2911
00:59:48.233 --> 00:59:49.632
work or causing issues,

2912
00:59:49.632 --> 00:59:50.552
right? They also make

2913
00:59:50.552 --> 00:59:51.231
it easier if you're

2914
00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:52.311
deploying these agents for

2915
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:53.490
someone else, for someone

2916
00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:54.190
in your team, for

2917
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.510
your engineering org, PM

2918
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:56.929
support. Custom agents allow

2919
00:59:56.929 --> 00:59:57.768
you to make your

2920
00:59:57.768 --> 00:59:59.007
agents safe, right? You

2921
00:59:59.007 --> 00:59:59.568
can set up hook

2922
00:59:59.568 --> 01:00:01.224
You can use different
