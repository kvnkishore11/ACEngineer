978
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.440
is a very consistent

979
00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.219
three-step pattern you can

980
00:20:02.219 --> 00:20:02.939
use to think about

981
00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:04.397
how to design and

982
00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:05.678
build your prompts, right?

983
00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:07.457
Inputs, we have the

984
00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:08.436
actual work that your

985
00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:09.455
agent does, and then

986
00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:10.615
we have the report.

987
00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:12.055
Now, obviously, all of

988
00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:13.213
this information is important

989
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.094
for your agent, but

990
00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:14.913
the input and the

991
00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.813
output are specifically useful

992
00:20:16.813 --> 00:20:17.652
for you and your

993
00:20:17.652 --> 00:20:18.531
team. Now we can

994
00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:19.711
quickly know what's coming

995
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.611
in and what's going

996
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.670
out, right? Of course,

997
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.170
we'll be spending a

998
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:22.750
lot of time on

999
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.969
the workflow, dialing this

1000
00:20:23.969 --> 00:20:24.528
in, making it do

1001
00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:25.509
exactly what you want,

1002
00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:25.887
but this is a

1003
00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:27.087
useful framework for thinking

1004
00:20:27.087 --> 00:20:28.307
about how to build

1005
00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.246
great reusable agentic prompts
