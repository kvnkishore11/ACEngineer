1050
00:21:29.249 --> 00:21:30.807
out our extended lesson

1051
00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:32.607
on context engineering to

1052
00:21:32.607 --> 00:21:34.007
understand how context priming

1053
00:21:34.007 --> 00:21:35.506
can be more valuable

1054
00:21:35.506 --> 00:21:36.205
than using a memory

1055
00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:37.205
file. But anyway, let's

1056
00:21:37.205 --> 00:21:37.685
go ahead and clear

1057
00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:38.585
this out. Right. And

1058
00:21:38.585 --> 00:21:39.265
let's just kick off

1059
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:40.444
build. And we pass

1060
00:21:40.444 --> 00:21:41.463
in no path to

1061
00:21:41.463 --> 00:21:42.703
our plan. Right. Our

1062
00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:43.643
variable isn't there. So

1063
00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:44.623
right away, our agent

1064
00:21:44.623 --> 00:21:45.501
sees this and it

1065
00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:47.013
stops. Right. This is

1066
00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:47.833
the equivalent of an

1067
00:21:48.012 --> 00:21:49.612
early return asking for

1068
00:21:49.612 --> 00:21:51.151
feedback, right? We need

1069
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:52.391
some information, we cannot

1070
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:53.789
proceed unless we have

1071
00:21:54.134 --> 00:21:55.272
a path to plan.

1072
00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.073
This is of course

1073
00:21:56.073 --> 00:21:57.571
the most simple version

1074
00:21:57.571 --> 00:21:58.791
of flow control inside

1075
00:21:58.791 --> 00:21:59.391
of your prompts. You

1076
00:21:59.391 --> 00:22:00.351
can imagine this getting
