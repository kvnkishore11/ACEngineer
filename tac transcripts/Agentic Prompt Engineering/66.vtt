1619
00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:01.084
the most powerful section

1620
00:33:01.084 --> 00:33:01.844
of all your prompts,

1621
00:33:01.864 --> 00:33:02.983
the workflow. So this

1622
00:33:02.983 --> 00:33:03.663
is great. You can

1623
00:33:03.663 --> 00:33:05.563
see our agent returning

1624
00:33:05.563 --> 00:33:07.001
in that exact format.

1625
00:33:07.201 --> 00:33:08.220
We had AI docs

1626
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.938
report right here, success

1627
00:33:09.938 --> 00:33:11.435
or failure URL, markdown

1628
00:33:11.435 --> 00:33:12.255
path, there it is.

1629
00:33:12.255 --> 00:33:13.153
So we have massive

1630
00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.810
control over this agent,

1631
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.890
right? We knew exactly

1632
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.867
what was gonna happen

1633
00:33:16.867 --> 00:33:17.906
when we kicked off

1634
00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:19.144
this prompt, okay? And

1635
00:33:19.144 --> 00:33:20.044
this is the key

1636
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.834
for transitioning to out

1637
00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:23.213
loop agentic code and

1638
00:33:23.213 --> 00:33:23.733
you need to know

1639
00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:24.334
what your prompts are

1640
00:33:24.334 --> 00:33:25.212
gonna do. And the

1641
00:33:25.212 --> 00:33:26.093
best way to know

1642
00:33:26.153 --> 00:33:27.212
is to be consistent

1643
00:33:27.212 --> 00:33:28.153
and of course to

1644
00:33:28.153 --> 00:33:29.393
test and to prove

1645
00:33:29.393 --> 00:33:30.873
out your agentic prompts,
