2312
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:30.349
This is primary agent

2313
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:32.266
delegation from a delegation

2314
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:34.378
prompt and we appended

2315
00:47:34.378 --> 00:47:35.217
the system prompt. Okay,

2316
00:47:35.217 --> 00:47:35.836
so this is not

2317
00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:37.436
a system prompt overwrite,

2318
00:47:37.436 --> 00:47:38.516
which we discuss in

2319
00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:40.195
the third agentic horizon

2320
00:47:40.195 --> 00:47:41.556
extended lesson, where we

2321
00:47:41.556 --> 00:47:42.594
focus on the Claude

2322
00:47:42.594 --> 00:47:44.414
Code SDK for building

2323
00:47:44.414 --> 00:47:45.474
out agents, right? We

2324
00:47:45.474 --> 00:47:46.574
can do full system

2325
00:47:46.574 --> 00:47:48.153
prompt overwrites, very dangerous,

2326
00:47:48.213 --> 00:47:49.353
but very powerful. You

2327
00:47:49.353 --> 00:47:49.992
can see here, we

2328
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:52.172
are appending key information

2329
00:47:52.193 --> 00:47:53.791
that we always want

2330
00:47:53.972 --> 00:47:55.211
our agent to follow,

2331
00:47:55.231 --> 00:47:56.550
okay? So here we're

2332
00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.590
attaching some information, we're

2333
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:58.210
actually building out a

2334
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:59.610
workflow into the system

2335
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.750
prompt. The system prompt
