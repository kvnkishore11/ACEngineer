590
00:12:29.452 --> 00:12:30.052
with prompts, I like

591
00:12:30.052 --> 00:12:31.052
to just always open

592
00:12:31.052 --> 00:12:31.751
it up in full

593
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.591
and then collapse to

594
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:33.610
the second level so

595
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.410
that you can see

596
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.669
all of the sections

597
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.168
consistently. You can quickly

598
00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:38.948
see the composable sections

599
00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:40.307
in this prompt. OK,

600
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.466
this immediately gives you

601
00:12:41.466 --> 00:12:42.567
a good idea of

602
00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:44.145
how complex and how

603
00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:45.466
powerful the prompt is.

604
00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:45.965
So you can see

605
00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:46.504
here we have more

606
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:47.504
metadata. We have the

607
00:12:47.504 --> 00:12:49.004
model now argument, hint,

608
00:12:49.004 --> 00:12:50.602
description and allowed tools

609
00:12:50.623 --> 00:12:51.442
title. And then we

610
00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:52.761
have our purpose. And

611
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:54.302
so notice the language

612
00:12:54.302 --> 00:12:55.020
here, right? Create a

613
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.860
detailed implementation plan based

614
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.438
on the users requirements.

615
00:12:58.438 --> 00:12:59.558
We're just like very

616
00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:01.597
directly talking to our
