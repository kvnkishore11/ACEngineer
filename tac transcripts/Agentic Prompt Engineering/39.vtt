WEBVTT

955
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:30.470
use we can get

956
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.349
out of our prompts

957
00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:33.048
by using these consistent

958
00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.388
and swappable prompt structures.

959
00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:36.928
The workflow prompt is

960
00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.807
very, very powerful. All

961
00:19:38.807 --> 00:19:39.968
the prompts stack up

962
00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:40.767
on each other and

963
00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:41.846
the workflow prompt is

964
00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:43.487
an absolute pillar for

965
00:19:43.487 --> 00:19:45.365
all subsequent prompt levels.

966
00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.226
It's important to note

967
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:47.006
here, by the way,

968
00:19:47.137 --> 00:19:47.836
that every one of

969
00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:48.516
these prompts, if you

970
00:19:48.516 --> 00:19:49.574
open up build, every

971
00:19:49.574 --> 00:19:50.451
one of these prompts

972
00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:51.550
has a kind of

973
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.188
consistent structure, right? It

974
00:19:53.188 --> 00:19:54.744
has the inputs, it

975
00:19:54.744 --> 00:19:56.022
has the workflow and

976
00:19:56.022 --> 00:19:57.461
it has the output,

977
00:19:57.481 --> 00:19:59.300
input, workflow, output. This

978
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.440
is a very consistent
