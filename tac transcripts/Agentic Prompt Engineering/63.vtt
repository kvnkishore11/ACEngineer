1541
00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:30.278
formula. And guess what?

1542
00:31:30.278 --> 00:31:30.798
I'm handing you the

1543
00:31:30.798 --> 00:31:32.117
working formula right now

1544
00:31:32.117 --> 00:31:33.676
with these prompt formats.

1545
00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:34.336
All right, so you

1546
00:31:34.336 --> 00:31:35.476
can see here variables.

1547
00:31:35.536 --> 00:31:36.175
We just have one

1548
00:31:36.175 --> 00:31:37.494
static variable for this

1549
00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:39.294
load AI docs delegation

1550
00:31:39.294 --> 00:31:40.334
prompt. We are going

1551
00:31:40.334 --> 00:31:41.492
to delete old docs

1552
00:31:41.492 --> 00:31:43.291
after 24 hours and

1553
00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:44.571
our AI docs here,

1554
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:46.030
we have documentation for

1555
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.269
agents. And if we

1556
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:48.089
open that up, Our

1557
00:31:48.089 --> 00:31:49.169
agent has just deleted

1558
00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:50.328
them. It's just deleted

1559
00:31:50.328 --> 00:31:51.407
all these and now

1560
00:31:51.407 --> 00:31:52.208
it's going to reload

1561
00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:52.907
them because they were

1562
00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:54.326
older than 24 hours.

1563
00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:54.787
You can see here,

1564
00:31:54.787 --> 00:31:55.665
same deal. We're going

1565
00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:56.465
to loop where we

1566
00:31:56.465 --> 00:31:57.744
have a explicit, a

1567
00:31:57.744 --> 00:31:58.984
new on the fly

1568
00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:00.183
information dense keyword that
