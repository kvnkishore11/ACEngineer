00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.246
engineering abilities by mastering

133
00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:31.566
the prompts and their

134
00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:37.262
composable sections. So at

135
00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:38.141
the first level, we

136
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.800
have the high level

137
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.799
prompt. It's the reusable

138
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.838
ad hoc static prompt.

139

into a file as

142
00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:49.396
soon as you start

143
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.876
repeating work that you

144
00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:51.855
know that your agent

145
00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:52.475
can do without a

146
00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:53.875
problem. It contains up

147
00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:54.775
to three and no

148
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.334

150
00:03:58.018 --> 00:03:59.016
