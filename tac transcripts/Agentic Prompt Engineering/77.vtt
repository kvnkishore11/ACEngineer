1885
00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:31.188
documentation documentation, but this

1886
00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:32.827
is a context map.

1887
00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:33.965
Okay. It's just clear

1888
00:38:33.965 --> 00:38:35.025
to call this documentation

1889
00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:35.885
right here. So that's

1890
00:38:35.885 --> 00:38:36.585
what we're doing. All

1891
00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:37.204
right. And then we

1892
00:38:37.204 --> 00:38:37.965
of course have our

1893
00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:39.724
specified format. So this

1894
00:38:39.724 --> 00:38:40.744
is, this is very

1895
00:38:40.744 --> 00:38:42.483
important. This is the

1896
00:38:42.483 --> 00:38:44.842
template. Okay. So intersections,

1897
00:38:44.842 --> 00:38:45.802
right? This is, we

1898
00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:46.800
actually are missing that

1899
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.701
here. This is our

1900
00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:49.139
template. Okay. And this

1901
00:38:49.139 --> 00:38:50.719
is key. This section

1902
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.559
gives your agent running

1903
00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:53.878
this agentic prompt, the

1904
00:38:53.878 --> 00:38:56.134
exact formula the exact

1905
00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.472
output structure that you

1906
00:38:57.472 --> 00:38:58.271
wanna generate. Now, it

1907
00:38:58.271 --> 00:38:59.291
doesn't just do that.

1908
00:38:59.311 --> 00:39:00.070
We talk about this
