1495
00:30:28.888 --> 00:30:30.107
course, that's what TAC

1496
00:30:30.107 --> 00:30:30.627
is all about. That

1497
00:30:30.627 --> 00:30:31.487
was a big, big

1498
00:30:31.527 --> 00:30:32.746
theme inside of TAC,

1499
00:30:32.746 --> 00:30:34.565
spinning up these pipelines

1500
00:30:34.565 --> 00:30:36.304
of agents that operate

1501
00:30:36.344 --> 00:30:37.982
with and without us

1502
00:30:38.182 --> 00:30:39.961
via Outloop systems, big

1503
00:30:39.961 --> 00:30:41.061
idea, all this prompt

1504
00:30:41.061 --> 00:30:42.520
engineering, all this agentic

1505
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.760
prompt engineering is just

1506
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.240
about tapping into that

1507
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.759
better than anyone. So

1508
00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:47.619
for that reason, this

1509
00:30:47.619 --> 00:30:48.799
is S tier, ultra

1510
00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.578
useful, ultra valuable, very

1511
00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:51.638
hard to use though,

1512
00:30:51.858 --> 00:30:52.417
right? You need to

1513
00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:53.258
be conscious about the

1514
00:30:53.258 --> 00:30:54.798
flow of information between

1515
00:30:54.798 --> 00:30:56.077
your agents. So that's

1516
00:30:56.077 --> 00:30:57.356
just one way to

1517
00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:58.317
use this, right? You

1518
00:30:58.317 --> 00:30:59.557
can see we're getting

1519
00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.836
that response flowing back
