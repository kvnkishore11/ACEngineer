466
00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:00.368
prompts. You can see

467
00:10:00.368 --> 00:10:00.988
here, this is the

468
00:10:00.988 --> 00:10:02.707
foundation for the workflow

469
00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:03.727
prompt. All right, we're

470
00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:05.107
now executing a series

471
00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:06.027
of steps that can

472
00:10:06.027 --> 00:10:07.126
get very complex that

473
00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.427
can call many, many

474
00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:09.767
tools. All right, so

475
00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:10.307
let's look at another

476
00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:11.006
prompt, right? We have

477
00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:12.166
this build prompt. Let's

478
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:12.666
check this out. And

479
00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:13.505
you can see here

480
00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:14.446
a little bit more

481
00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:15.966
metadata, right? Our build

482
00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.504
prompt is only able

483
00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:18.585
to use read, write

484
00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.845
and bash tools. And

485
00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:20.825
it has an argument

486
00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:21.803
hint. The argument of

487
00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:22.403
course leads to a

488
00:10:22.403 --> 00:10:24.163
really important section, a

489
00:10:24.163 --> 00:10:26.883
super underappreciated section, the

490
00:10:26.883 --> 00:10:28.743
variables. Okay. And so,

491
00:10:28.923 --> 00:10:29.302
you know, before we

492
00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:30.381
get to variables, everything
