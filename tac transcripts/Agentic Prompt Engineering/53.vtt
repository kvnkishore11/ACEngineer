1299
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:31.320
how distinct every one

1300
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.039
of these prompts are.

1301
00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:32.680
They give you a

1302
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.960
new advantage, right? A

1303
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.599
new capability. Key section

1304
00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:36.119
here, if you're gonna

1305
00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:37.359
be delegating, you're going

1306
00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:38.739
to want variables that

1307
00:26:38.739 --> 00:26:39.878
you can pass into

1308
00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:41.459
your sub-agents, okay? So

1309
00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:42.378
that's the only section

1310
00:26:42.378 --> 00:26:42.979
tweak that you might

1311
00:26:42.979 --> 00:26:43.638
make. Let's go ahead

1312
00:26:43.638 --> 00:26:44.578
and open up parallel

1313
00:26:44.578 --> 00:26:45.878
sub-agents. Once again, you

1314
00:26:45.898 --> 00:26:47.518
know, same process, collapse.

1315
00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:48.438
Check out the format.

1316
00:26:48.438 --> 00:26:50.201
There's our metadata. title

1317
00:26:50.201 --> 00:26:51.382
purpose. You know this

1318
00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:53.121
workflow should feel repetitive

1319
00:26:53.121 --> 00:26:53.661
and that's what you

1320
00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:54.580
want right. You don't

1321
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.060
want it to be

1322
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.300
novel every time you

1323
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.160
open up a prompt

1324
00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.319
that consumes your engineering

1325
00:26:58.319 --> 00:26:59.799
cycles that consumes your

1326
00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:01.038
ability to work through
