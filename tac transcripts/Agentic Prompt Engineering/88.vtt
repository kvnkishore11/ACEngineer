2146
00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:00.480
place this, self-improving, we're

2147
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.039
gonna put this right

2148
00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:03.458
below the delegation, right

2149
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:04.177
below the template meta

2150
00:44:04.177 --> 00:44:04.918
prompt, and actually we're

2151
00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:06.157
gonna call this expert

2152
00:44:06.157 --> 00:44:06.956
level. So this is

2153
00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:08.016
very, very challenging to

2154
00:44:08.016 --> 00:44:08.815
do and to write.

2155
00:44:08.976 --> 00:44:10.255
The expert section in

2156
00:44:10.255 --> 00:44:12.054
itself is less challenging

2157
00:44:12.054 --> 00:44:12.733
to write than the

2158
00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:14.012
actual full prompt, but

2159
00:44:14.012 --> 00:44:14.632
we're gonna place these

2160
00:44:14.632 --> 00:44:15.572
both at A tier

2161
00:44:15.572 --> 00:44:16.992
usefulness, and we're gonna

2162
00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:18.130
give them A and

2163
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.751
S tier skill requirement,

2164
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:20.309
all right? A couple

2165
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.769
of things we haven't

2166
00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:21.630
covered in any of

2167
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.389
our prompts here, examples

2168
00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:24.467
and the relevant files.

2169
00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:24.927
So let's just go

2170
00:44:24.927 --> 00:44:25.807
ahead and place is

2171
00:44:25.827 --> 00:44:26.768
you've already seen this,

2172
00:44:26.768 --> 00:44:27.887
right? Examples is when

2173
00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:29.367
you detail some specific

2174
00:44:29.407 --> 00:44:30.507
element of your prompt
