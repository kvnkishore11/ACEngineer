441
00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:30.409
information in the report,

442
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:31.129
it all goes under

443
00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:32.149
the report section, right?

444
00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:33.110
This is your output

445
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.129
section. This is your

446
00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:35.589
format section, okay? And

447
00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:36.489
to be super clear,

448
00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:37.469
you can call these

449
00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:39.368
sections whatever you want.

450
00:09:39.368 --> 00:09:39.988
I'm using the most

451
00:09:39.988 --> 00:09:42.028
consistent, the most information

452
00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:44.506
dense keywords to represent

453
00:09:44.547 --> 00:09:45.986
every section, okay? Out

454
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:46.687
of the tens of

455
00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.005
thousands of prompts I've

456
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:48.826
seen and used and

457
00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:50.730
run these sections, keep

458
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.070
coming back over and

459
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.809
over and over. So

460
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:53.509
no matter what you

461
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:54.729
call them, they're still

462
00:09:54.729 --> 00:09:55.528
going to be there

463
00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.688
as you scale up

464
00:09:56.688 --> 00:09:57.729
the level and the

465
00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:59.389
capability of your agentic

466
00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:00.368
prompts. You can see
