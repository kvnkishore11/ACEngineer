1178
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.159
image generation prompt following

1179
00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:01.897
the image loop below.

1180
00:24:01.897 --> 00:24:02.478
So we have this

1181
00:24:02.478 --> 00:24:03.876
XML block to add

1182
00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.895
additional structure. We're communicating

1183
00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:07.135
to our agent when

1184
00:24:07.135 --> 00:24:08.734
the image loop starts

1185
00:24:08.734 --> 00:24:09.894
and stops. We're also,

1186
00:24:09.894 --> 00:24:11.074
of course, communicating to

1187
00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:12.133
our team where the

1188
00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:13.593
loop is. We're operating

1189
00:24:13.593 --> 00:24:14.551
in natural language. We

1190
00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:16.530
want consistent patterns throughout

1191
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.750
our prompts for the

1192
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.309
trifecta, right? And so

1193
00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:20.788
just more workflow details,

1194
00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:21.588
right? Top to bottom,

1195
00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:23.067
use this tool, pass

1196
00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:24.508
an argument, aspect ratio,

1197
00:24:24.508 --> 00:24:25.907
wait for completion. And

1198
00:24:25.907 --> 00:24:27.048
then throughout we're referencing

1199
00:24:27.087 --> 00:24:27.787
our variable. So you

1200
00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:29.007
can see here, this

1201
00:24:29.027 --> 00:24:29.767
is getting more and

1202
00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:30.826
more complex, right? We're
