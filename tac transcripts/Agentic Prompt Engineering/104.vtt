2531
00:51:59.523 --> 00:52:00.704
You can have detailed

2532
00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:01.804
workflows in your system

2533
00:52:01.804 --> 00:52:02.623
prompt. I'll go ahead

2534
00:52:02.623 --> 00:52:03.443
and make an exception

2535
00:52:03.443 --> 00:52:03.943
here. I'll move this

2536
00:52:03.943 --> 00:52:05.503
one up. And because

2537
00:52:05.503 --> 00:52:06.262
sometimes you will wanna

2538
00:52:06.262 --> 00:52:08.684
prescribe a specific workflow

2539
00:52:08.684 --> 00:52:09.744
to operate in, right?

2540
00:52:09.764 --> 00:52:10.164
But you wanna be

2541
00:52:10.164 --> 00:52:11.083
careful here because you

2542
00:52:11.083 --> 00:52:12.922
don't wanna take away

2543
00:52:13.001 --> 00:52:14.260
too much agency, right?

2544
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.518
And workflows reduce agency

2545
00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:18.516
to increase determinism, right?

2546
00:52:18.737 --> 00:52:19.117
You're gonna be a

2547
00:52:19.117 --> 00:52:20.476
step-by-step play with an

2548
00:52:20.476 --> 00:52:21.675
agent with the system

2549
00:52:21.675 --> 00:52:23.074
prompt specifically, you really

2550
00:52:23.074 --> 00:52:24.213
want your workflow to

2551
00:52:24.213 --> 00:52:26.090
be a loose structure

2552
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:26.891
of what you're trying

2553
00:52:26.891 --> 00:52:28.268
to accomplish. And usually

2554
00:52:28.268 --> 00:52:29.688
that's accomplished with these

2555
00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:31.626
sections, all right? Purpose,
