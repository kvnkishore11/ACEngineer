1667
00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:00.780
you can see we

1668
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.259
have three dynamic variables

1669
00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:02.878
and you know where

1670
00:34:02.878 --> 00:34:03.439
this is going. We

1671
00:34:03.439 --> 00:34:04.159
covered this in our

1672
00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.397
elite context engineering. I'm

1673
00:34:05.397 --> 00:34:06.198
not going to run

1674
00:34:06.198 --> 00:34:07.176
this but if we

1675
00:34:07.176 --> 00:34:08.317
open up the instructions

1676
00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:09.036
we have some you

1677
00:34:09.036 --> 00:34:11.454
know auxiliary important information

1678
00:34:11.454 --> 00:34:13.554
for the workflow. Okay.

1679
00:34:13.554 --> 00:34:14.353
And the workflow is

1680
00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:15.373
of course the step-by-step

1681
00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:16.173
play. This one gets

1682
00:34:16.173 --> 00:34:17.592
really complex because we

1683
00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:19.193
start detailing exactly how

1684
00:34:19.193 --> 00:34:19.972
to kick off a

1685
00:34:19.972 --> 00:34:21.432
brand new agent via

1686
00:34:21.432 --> 00:34:22.492
the CLI. And we're

1687
00:34:22.492 --> 00:34:23.753
actually updating the system

1688
00:34:23.753 --> 00:34:24.552
prompt in a very

1689
00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:25.831
massive way here. We'll

1690
00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:26.831
talk about system prompts

1691
00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:27.972
versus user prompts in

1692
00:34:27.972 --> 00:34:28.891
a moment, but you

1693
00:34:28.891 --> 00:34:29.731
can see here, this

1694
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:30.431
agent is going to
