2266
00:46:29.612 --> 00:46:30.851
idea here with a

2267
00:46:30.851 --> 00:46:31.891
system prompt versus a

2268
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:33.150
user prompt is the

2269
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.590
scope and level of

2270
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.369
persistence. Okay. It's important

2271
00:46:36.389 --> 00:46:37.429
to just say this.

2272
00:46:37.568 --> 00:46:38.409
You likely already know

2273
00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:39.688
this, but you've likely

2274
00:46:39.688 --> 00:46:41.146
written like most engineers,

2275
00:46:41.146 --> 00:46:42.347
hundreds and thousands of

2276
00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:44.365
times more user prompts,

2277
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:45.286
probably even more than

2278
00:46:45.286 --> 00:46:46.425
that, but more user

2279
00:46:46.425 --> 00:46:47.144
prompts than you have

2280
00:46:47.144 --> 00:46:49.043
system prompts. You have

2281
00:46:49.043 --> 00:46:50.103
to be a lot

2282
00:46:50.103 --> 00:46:51.302
more delicate when you're

2283
00:46:51.322 --> 00:46:52.802
writing your system prompts.

2284
00:46:52.822 --> 00:46:54.561
System prompts are rules

2285
00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:56.639
for all conversations. The

2286
00:46:56.639 --> 00:46:58.179
rules for for every

2287
00:46:58.199 --> 00:46:59.438
user prompt you write.

2288
00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:00.539
And the scale of
