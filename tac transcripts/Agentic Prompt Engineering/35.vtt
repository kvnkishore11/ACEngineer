847
00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:30.103
a hundred foot view.

848
00:17:30.123 --> 00:17:31.403
There's our previous prime

849
00:17:31.403 --> 00:17:32.123
command that ran. We

850
00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:32.981
can of course clear

851
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:34.501
that out and then

852
00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:35.657
prime the tier list

853
00:17:35.718 --> 00:17:36.596
and now the tier

854
00:17:36.596 --> 00:17:37.336
list is going to

855
00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:39.115
run not these files,

856
00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:40.115
but in our workflow,

857
00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:42.015
we've specified exactly what

858
00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:42.554
files we want to

859
00:17:42.554 --> 00:17:43.693
read. Okay, read these

860
00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:44.992
files exclusively. We have

861
00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:45.432
to be a little

862
00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:46.173
bit stronger with our

863
00:17:46.173 --> 00:17:47.152
language here. We have

864
00:17:47.152 --> 00:17:48.951
an information dense keyword

865
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.471
important that has more

866
00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:51.609
value to our agents

867
00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:52.289
and to the models

868
00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:53.148
that run them. And

869
00:17:53.148 --> 00:17:53.548
so you can see

870
00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:54.868
here, we're only reading

871
00:17:54.868 --> 00:17:56.567
these specific files, but

872
00:17:56.627 --> 00:17:57.987
our agent now has

873
00:17:57.987 --> 00:17:59.346
in its context window,

874
00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:00.445
thanks to our prompt
