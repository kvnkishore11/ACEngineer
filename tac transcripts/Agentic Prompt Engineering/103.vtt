2510
00:51:28.927 --> 00:51:30.407
prompts, you usually don't

2511
00:51:30.407 --> 00:51:32.347
wanna prescribe a workflow,

2512
00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:34.045
you don't have variables,

2513
00:51:34.177 --> 00:51:36.317
outside of static variables.

2514
00:51:36.317 --> 00:51:36.835
And you don't really

2515
00:51:36.835 --> 00:51:38.416
want to touch reporting

2516
00:51:38.456 --> 00:51:40.253
structures, although you can

2517
00:51:40.253 --> 00:51:41.534
specify and steer the

2518
00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:43.132
output if you want.

2519
00:51:43.132 --> 00:51:44.271
Expertise doesn't really make

2520
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:45.411
sense. Templates don't really

2521
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:47.070
make sense. Metadata will

2522
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.389
all be passed in,

2523
00:51:48.469 --> 00:51:49.708
right? Relevant files, code-based

2524
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:50.987
structure. These are not

2525
00:51:50.987 --> 00:51:51.847
things you want to

2526
00:51:51.847 --> 00:51:53.987
usually prescribe to your

2527
00:51:53.987 --> 00:51:55.365
system prompt. All right,

2528
00:51:55.365 --> 00:51:56.704
the key sections for

2529
00:51:56.704 --> 00:51:57.784
the system prompt with

2530
00:51:57.784 --> 00:51:59.324
the exception of workflow.

2531
00:51:59.523 --> 00:52:00.704
You can have detailed
