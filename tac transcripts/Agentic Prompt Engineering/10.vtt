203
00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:00.206
also have the high

204
00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:01.286
level prompt. Now this

205
00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:01.826
is gonna be more

206
00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:02.884
useful and very easy

207
00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:04.125
to write. There's not

208
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.024
much going on here,

209
00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:06.423
right? Just type a

210
00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:07.682
high level void of

211
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.341
detail description of what

212
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.021
you want your agent

213
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:10.942
to do and hope

214
00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:11.661
that they do it.

215
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:12.341
So let's scale this

216
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:13.060
up a little bit

217
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.439
more with the start

218
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.480
prompt. So again, we

219
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.478
have a very similar

220
00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:17.459
structure, but here you

221
00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:18.117
can see we have

222
00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:18.937
a little bit more

223
00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:19.718
detail. So we have

224
00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:20.716
our title, we have

225
00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:21.836
the purpose, and then

226
00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:22.755
we have our high

227
00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.475
level prompt that's starting

228
00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.495
to move into mid-level

229
00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:26.733
territory, right? We have

230
00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:27.692
some details here. We

231
00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:28.773
have the CD command.

232
00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:29.771
We have bun install,

233
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.790
bun dev. So there's
