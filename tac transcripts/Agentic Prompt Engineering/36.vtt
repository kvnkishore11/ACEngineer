00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:00.445
thanks to our prompt

875
00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:01.884
engineering, it has a

876
00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:03.144
map of how to

877
00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:04.784
quickly find relevant files.

878
00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:05.564
Okay, so instead of

879
00:18:05.564 --> 00:18:06.403
having to search this

880
00:18:06.403 --> 00:18:08.702
manually, run additional tools,

881
00:18:08.803 --> 00:18:10.082
chew up additional tokens,

882
00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:11.021
it has a quick

883
00:18:11.021 --> 00:18:12.837
simple map. Okay. And

884
00:18:12.837 --> 00:18:14.277
again, codebase structure,

885
00:18:14.277 --> 00:18:14.996
you and your team

886
00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:15.855
can quickly look at

887
00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:17.275
this and understand it.

888
00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:17.794
Let's go ahead and

889
00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:18.693
rank this one. This

890
00:18:18.693 --> 00:18:20.633
is not as useful

891
00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:21.932
because of course agents

892
00:18:21.932 --> 00:18:22.931
can do this. The

893
00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:23.950
big benefit here is

894
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.250
that it's faster, right?

895
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.269
This speeds your agent

896
00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:27.028
up. It helps your

897
00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:28.387
agent understand more quickly.

898
00:18:28.488 --> 00:18:29.386
So we're going to

899
00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:30.266
throw this right under
