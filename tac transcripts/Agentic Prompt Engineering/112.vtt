00:55:59.152 --> 00:56:01.487
writing customizable agents for

2709
00:56:01.487 --> 00:56:02.726
your domain specific use

2710
00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:03.603
case, for your domain

2711
00:56:03.603 --> 00:56:05.300
specific problems. I recommend

2712
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:05.820
you check out the

2713
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.516
Claude Code SDK mastery

2714
00:56:08.516 --> 00:56:09.677
to build your own

2715
00:56:09.677 --> 00:56:11.936
specialized agents. TACT is

2716
00:56:11.936 --> 00:56:13.614
all about scaling up

2717
00:56:13.614 --> 00:56:14.474
what you can do

2718
00:56:14.554 --> 00:56:15.653
with agents. It's about

2719
00:56:15.653 --> 00:56:16.833
getting out the loop.

2720
00:56:17.112 --> 00:56:18.672
It's about exiting this

2721
00:56:18.693 --> 00:56:19.952
simple back and forth

2722
00:56:19.972 --> 00:56:21.690
prompting experience with these

2723
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:22.690
agents so that you

2724
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.610
can scale up what

2725
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:24.530
you can do by

2726
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.528
building pipelines that do

2727
00:56:26.528 --> 00:56:28.688
one thing extraordinarily well.

2728
00:56:28.688 --> 00:56:30.746
Use these seven levels
