00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:12.474
The prompt is now

2
00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:14.391
the fundamental unit of

3
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.248
engineering. And with agents,

4
00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:17.725
every prompt you create

5
00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:19.643
becomes a force multiplier.

6
00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:22.184
One well-crafted prompt can

7
00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:24.164
generate tens and hundreds

8
00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:25.283
of hours of productive

9
00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:26.562
work. One bad prompt

10
00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:27.963
compounds failure at the

11
00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:29.121
same rate. So how

12
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.681
do you consistently create
