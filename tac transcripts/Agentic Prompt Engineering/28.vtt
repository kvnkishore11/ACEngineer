671
00:13:59.597 --> 00:14:00.697
and do a search

672
00:14:00.697 --> 00:14:01.616
on this variable, right?

673
00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:02.697
And throughout, you can

674
00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:04.696
see this getting referenced.

675
00:14:04.735 --> 00:14:05.615
Notice how much time

676
00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:06.615
I'm saving by having

677
00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:08.054
just a single static

678
00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:08.914
variable here that we

679
00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:09.735
can reference throughout the

680
00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:11.514
prompt. And also notice

681
00:14:11.514 --> 00:14:12.153
how easy it is

682
00:14:12.153 --> 00:14:13.893
to understand this. Great

683
00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:16.173
prompting is great communicating,

684
00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:17.312
okay? So what we're

685
00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:18.172
doing here is quickly

686
00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:19.912
communicating to ourselves, to

687
00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:20.770
our future selves, to

688
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.811
our team, and of

689
00:14:21.811 --> 00:14:23.130
course, to our agent,

690
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:24.590
okay? So user prompt's

691
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.409
gonna come in, is

692
00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:26.668
gonna output to the

693
00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:28.227
specs directory, right? And

694
00:14:28.227 --> 00:14:29.427
very quickly, just two

695
00:14:29.427 --> 00:14:30.767
sections, you know exactly
