2220
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.108
agents, specifically because you've

2221
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:33.646
templated your agentic engineering,

2222
00:45:33.646 --> 00:45:35.197
okay? This is This

2223
00:45:35.197 --> 00:45:36.077
is the big, you

2224
00:45:36.077 --> 00:45:36.476
know, kind of the

2225
00:45:36.476 --> 00:45:38.157
peak point of agentic

2226
00:45:38.177 --> 00:45:39.516
prompt engineering. Once you

2227
00:45:39.516 --> 00:45:40.675
can create the prompt

2228
00:45:40.695 --> 00:45:41.855
that helps you create

2229
00:45:41.855 --> 00:45:43.454
prompts, you start moving

2230
00:45:43.634 --> 00:45:45.313
much faster than other

2231
00:45:45.313 --> 00:45:46.693
engineers, right? Much, much

2232
00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:47.771
faster. You always want

2233
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:48.931
to come in, update,

2234
00:45:48.972 --> 00:45:50.351
tweak things, but your

2235
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:51.309
ability to have an

2236
00:45:51.329 --> 00:45:52.090
agent, to have a

2237
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.489
specialized workflow, to have

2238
00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:55.527
specialized sets of prompts

2239
00:45:55.527 --> 00:45:56.288
that allow you to

2240
00:45:56.387 --> 00:45:58.027
generate new prompts very

2241
00:45:58.027 --> 00:45:59.306
quickly will separate you

2242
00:45:59.306 --> 00:45:59.766
from the rest of

2243
00:45:59.766 --> 00:46:00.585
the pack, all right?
