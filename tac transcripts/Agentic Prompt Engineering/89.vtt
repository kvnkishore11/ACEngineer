2174
00:44:29.407 --> 00:44:30.507
element of your prompt

2175
00:44:30.527 --> 00:44:31.947
to showcase what you

2176
00:44:31.947 --> 00:44:33.467
want, either the output

2177
00:44:33.567 --> 00:44:34.347
or some result to

2178
00:44:34.347 --> 00:44:35.427
look like. This is

2179
00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:36.746
very useful and it

2180
00:44:36.746 --> 00:44:37.666
doesn't take that much

2181
00:44:37.666 --> 00:44:38.545
skill to create. We're

2182
00:44:38.545 --> 00:44:39.326
gonna put this in

2183
00:44:39.365 --> 00:44:40.985
A tier right below

2184
00:44:40.985 --> 00:44:42.565
variables, right? Because this

2185
00:44:42.565 --> 00:44:44.644
can drastically increase your

2186
00:44:44.644 --> 00:44:46.143
agent's performance. And then

2187
00:44:46.143 --> 00:44:47.224
we have relevant files.

2188
00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.523
This can be useful.

2189
00:44:48.523 --> 00:44:49.224
This is a lot

2190
00:44:49.224 --> 00:44:50.782
like code-based structure. When

2191
00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:51.983
you specify a set

2192
00:44:52.003 --> 00:44:53.302
of files, it's going

2193
00:44:53.302 --> 00:44:54.481
to speed things up

2194
00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:55.121
a little bit. It

2195
00:44:55.121 --> 00:44:56.061
gives your agent a

2196
00:44:56.061 --> 00:44:56.940
quick way to kind

2197
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.581
of reference and look

2198
00:44:58.581 --> 00:44:59.699
at existing files. But

2199
00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:00.380
this isn't like a
