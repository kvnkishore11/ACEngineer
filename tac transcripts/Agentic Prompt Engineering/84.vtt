2058
00:41:59.952 --> 00:42:01.550
very, very powerful prompt

2059
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.650
structure. Let's move on

2060
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:03.989
to the final level

2061
00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:04.688
and then let's talk

2062
00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.608
about system prompts versus

2063
00:42:06.608 --> 00:42:08.047
user prompts because we've

2064
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:09.246
been primarily looking at

2065
00:42:09.347 --> 00:42:12.985
user prompts. So at

2066
00:42:12.985 --> 00:42:14.382
our final level, we

2067
00:42:14.382 --> 00:42:16.717
have the self-improving prompt.

2068
00:42:16.737 --> 00:42:18.572
Inside of Claude Command's

2069
00:42:18.672 --> 00:42:20.588
experts directory, we have

2070
00:42:20.588 --> 00:42:22.489
a new agent experts

2071
00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:23.509
pattern that we detail

2072
00:42:23.509 --> 00:42:24.608
in our context engineering

2073
00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:25.507
lesson. Check that out

2074
00:42:25.507 --> 00:42:26.268
if you haven't. But

2075
00:42:26.268 --> 00:42:27.047
the idea here is

2076
00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:28.487
quite simple. Inside this

2077
00:42:28.487 --> 00:42:29.047
prompt here, we can

2078
00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:29.846
just crack this open

2079
00:42:29.846 --> 00:42:30.766
for a second and
