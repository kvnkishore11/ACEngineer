2288
00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:00.539
And the scale of

2289
00:47:00.539 --> 00:47:01.599
the impact of this,

2290
00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:02.659
when you're writing your

2291
00:47:02.659 --> 00:47:04.898
agents, you only truly

2292
00:47:04.898 --> 00:47:05.958
understand this and how

2293
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:07.117
important the system prompt

2294
00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:07.898
is when you start

2295
00:47:07.898 --> 00:47:09.376
building your own agents.

2296
00:47:09.376 --> 00:47:10.496
To be clear, most

2297
00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:12.137
engineers, as I've mentioned,

2298
00:47:12.157 --> 00:47:13.195
you will likely not

2299
00:47:13.195 --> 00:47:13.856
get to the system

2300
00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:14.936
prompt level. But if

2301
00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:15.815
you start building your

2302
00:47:15.815 --> 00:47:17.554
own specialized agents to

2303
00:47:17.554 --> 00:47:19.695
solve problems extraordinarily well,

2304
00:47:19.695 --> 00:47:20.474
you will want to

2305
00:47:20.474 --> 00:47:21.753
tap in to the

2306
00:47:21.753 --> 00:47:23.896
system prompt. Okay. And

2307
00:47:23.896 --> 00:47:24.996
in our background prompt,

2308
00:47:24.996 --> 00:47:25.815
we did this of

2309
00:47:25.815 --> 00:47:26.373
course, because we are

2310
00:47:26.373 --> 00:47:27.612
spinning up a brand

2311
00:47:27.612 --> 00:47:28.971
new Claude Code instance.

2312
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:30.349
This is primary agent
