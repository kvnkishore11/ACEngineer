1810
00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.128
Meta Prompt. Now, this

1811
00:37:00.128 --> 00:37:01.043
is a prompt used

1812
00:37:01.043 --> 00:37:02.617
to create another prompt

1813
00:37:02.849 --> 00:37:04.349
in a specific format.

1814
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:05.748
Levels one through let's

1815
00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:07.047
say four will be

1816
00:37:07.047 --> 00:37:08.387
80 or 90% of

1817
00:37:08.387 --> 00:37:09.367
all of your prompts,

1818
00:37:09.387 --> 00:37:10.027
right? And your code

1819
00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.226
bases doing real engineering

1820
00:37:11.226 --> 00:37:11.925
work, getting things done

1821
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:12.465
for you. When you

1822
00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:12.864
get up to level

1823
00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:13.744
five, six and seven,

1824
00:37:13.804 --> 00:37:14.364
you really get into

1825
00:37:14.364 --> 00:37:15.764
that meta territory where

1826
00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:16.643
your prompts are building

1827
00:37:16.643 --> 00:37:17.963
prompts and your prompts

1828
00:37:17.963 --> 00:37:19.141
are improving your other

1829
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:20.161
prompts, all right? We'll

1830
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:20.862
get to that in

1831
00:37:20.862 --> 00:37:21.920
level seven. The template

1832
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.981
meta prompt is very

1833
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:24.300
important. As you saw

1834
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.458
in TAC, template meta

1835
00:37:25.458 --> 00:37:26.938
prompts are an essential

1836
00:37:26.938 --> 00:37:29.130
concept for templating your

1837
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.588
engineering, okay? This is
