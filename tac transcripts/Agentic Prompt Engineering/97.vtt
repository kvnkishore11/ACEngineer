2361
00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:30.295
to handle many scenarios.

2362
00:48:30.335 --> 00:48:32.512
Mistakes scale to every

2363
00:48:32.512 --> 00:48:33.612
user prompt you run,

2364
00:48:33.751 --> 00:48:34.572
okay? You write this

2365
00:48:34.572 --> 00:48:35.530
once and you run

2366
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.708
this many, many times,

2367
00:48:37.929 --> 00:48:39.168
okay? So you write

2368
00:48:39.168 --> 00:48:40.487
a single agent with

2369
00:48:40.487 --> 00:48:41.985
one system prompt dedicated

2370
00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.224
to a specific problem.

2371
00:48:43.304 --> 00:48:44.005
And then if you

2372
00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:45.164
deploy 10 of those

2373
00:48:45.164 --> 00:48:46.463
agents, right? Say you're

2374
00:48:46.463 --> 00:48:47.481
operating some like chat

2375
00:48:47.481 --> 00:48:48.860
system or an agentic

2376
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.179
coding tool, whatever, every

2377
00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:51.719
single user prompt hits

2378
00:48:51.818 --> 00:48:53.090
that system prompt. right,

2379
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.646
every single one, and

2380
00:48:54.646 --> 00:48:55.726
then it just adds

2381
00:48:55.746 --> 00:48:56.603
your user prompt on

2382
00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:57.402
the bottom, okay? So

2383
00:48:57.402 --> 00:48:58.181
you can run, you

2384
00:48:58.181 --> 00:48:59.081
know, we've all run,

2385
00:48:59.239 --> 00:49:00.179
you know, some bad
