1766
00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:00.610
going to be in

1767
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:02.521
specs, slash something, something,

1768
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.360
something.md. And this comes

1769
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.320
right out of your

1770
00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.460
quick plan or your

1771
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.219
equivalent chore builder, feature

1772
00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:09.478
builder, or your even

1773
00:36:09.478 --> 00:36:12.336
more specific specialized plans

1774
00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.436
for specific sections of

1775
00:36:13.436 --> 00:36:14.496
your codebase, your

1776
00:36:14.536 --> 00:36:16.375
experts, right? Very powerful.

1777
00:36:16.394 --> 00:36:17.195
In terms of where

1778
00:36:17.195 --> 00:36:18.514
this places on our

1779
00:36:18.514 --> 00:36:19.574
tier list, these are

1780
00:36:19.574 --> 00:36:21.393
harder to use and

1781
00:36:21.592 --> 00:36:23.032
you can embed all

1782
00:36:23.032 --> 00:36:24.110
this logic into the

1783
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.451
individual prompts themselves, all

1784
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:26.349
right? We'll put this

1785
00:36:26.369 --> 00:36:28.150
in B tier use

1786
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.088
and maybe this belongs

1787
00:36:29.088 --> 00:36:29.809
in A, but I'm

1788
00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:30.309
gonna put this in
