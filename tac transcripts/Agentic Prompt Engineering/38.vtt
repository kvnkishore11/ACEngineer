927
00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:00.682
underneath. Okay. And so

928
00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:01.682
this is very common.

929
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:02.441
You know, you've seen,

930
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.520
you've likely seen prompts

931
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.240
like this where the

932
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.019
workflow step has decent

933
00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:07.459
amount of information underneath

934
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:08.738
the steps. The point

935
00:19:08.738 --> 00:19:09.377
is to keep these

936
00:19:09.377 --> 00:19:10.317
clear and concise. We

937
00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.356
could probably clean up

938
00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:12.217
this section a little

939
00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:13.455
bit and maybe turn

940
00:19:13.455 --> 00:19:14.336
it into an instruction

941
00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:15.134
set, but this is

942
00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:16.115
fine. Right. And then

943
00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:16.874
at the end here,

944
00:19:16.874 --> 00:19:18.134
we run what our

945
00:19:18.153 --> 00:19:20.053
original start prompt does

946
00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:21.272
at the end of

947
00:19:21.272 --> 00:19:23.051
this prompt, right? we

948
00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:23.932
boot up the application

949
00:19:23.932 --> 00:19:25.050
and solve dependencies, kick

950
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.570
it off, open the

951
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.050
browser. Okay? So you

952
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.510
can see here, we're

953
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.990
scaling up the value.

954
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.549
We're scaling up the

955
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:30.470
use we can get
