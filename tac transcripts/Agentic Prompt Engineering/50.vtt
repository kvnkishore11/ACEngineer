1226
00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:00.917
flow that your prompt

1227
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:01.916
is working through, all

1228
00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:02.676
right? So for that

1229
00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:03.416
reason, we're gonna place

1230
00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:04.135
this in A tier

1231
00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:06.035
usefulness and B tier

1232
00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:07.575
skill requirement. Let's crack

1233
00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:09.213
open the edit image

1234
00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:10.018
and you can see

1235
00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:10.938
a very similar format,

1236
00:25:10.938 --> 00:25:11.896
you know, nothing to

1237
00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:12.636
change here, right? We

1238
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:14.155
have a consistent process,

1239
00:25:14.155 --> 00:25:15.076
right? We have meditate

1240
00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:16.236
at the top title,

1241
00:25:16.316 --> 00:25:18.855
purpose, variables, workflow, and

1242
00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:19.855
notice here, no report

1243
00:25:19.855 --> 00:25:21.354
section. Remember every one

1244
00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:22.193
of these sections is

1245
00:25:22.193 --> 00:25:23.992
swappable. Use them only

1246
00:25:23.992 --> 00:25:24.492
if you need it.

1247
00:25:24.492 --> 00:25:25.333
If you don't care

1248
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:26.393
about the output format

1249
00:25:26.452 --> 00:25:27.311
of your prompt, right?

1250
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:28.571
Remember the three-step workflow,

1251
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:30.310
input, workflow, output. If
