742
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.389
can create nested bullet

743
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:32.287
points underneath your workflow

744
00:15:32.287 --> 00:15:33.946
steps. In upcoming prompts,

745
00:15:33.946 --> 00:15:34.504
you're gonna see that

746
00:15:34.504 --> 00:15:35.605
exactly. But you can

747
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:36.984
use instructions to just

748
00:15:36.984 --> 00:15:38.501
quickly tag on useful

749
00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:40.221
information to aid your

750
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:41.659
workflow, okay? So we

751
00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:42.519
have one new additional

752
00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:43.499
section here, right? We

753
00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:45.376
have the instructions section.

754
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:46.235
So how does this

755
00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:47.135
rank? This is gonna

756
00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:48.835
be right below the

757
00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:50.625
report. Right, so probably

758
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.024
as useful and as

759
00:15:52.024 --> 00:15:52.883
challenging to use is

760
00:15:52.883 --> 00:15:54.061
the report section, right?

761
00:15:54.061 --> 00:15:54.681
This is a bullet

762
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:56.339
list of additional information

763
00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:57.856
that aids the workflow,

764
00:15:57.897 --> 00:15:58.836
okay? So it's not

765
00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:00.154
ultra difficult to use,
