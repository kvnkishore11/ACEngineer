50
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:30.966
communicate with ourselves, with

51
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.027
our future self, our

52
00:01:32.027 --> 00:01:33.325
team, and of course,

53
00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:35.325
our agents. Most importantly,

54
00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:37.123
your agents. And once

55
00:01:37.123 --> 00:01:38.463
you write these prompts,

56
00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:39.843
once they become reusable,

57
00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:40.362
you get to a

58
00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:41.981
level where you know

59
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:43.260
what the prompt will

60
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.539
do given a certain

61
00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.197
input. And this accelerates

62
00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:47.337
you along the path

63
00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.875
of moving from inside

64
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:49.914
the loop, outside the

65
00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:50.813
loop, all the way

66
00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:52.411
up to ZTE, a

67
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.382
critical concept we discuss

68
00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:55.141
in TAC. This is

69
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.900
the North Star of

70
00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:58.519
agentic coding. You want

71
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.200
to be handing off

72
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.179
more work to compute
