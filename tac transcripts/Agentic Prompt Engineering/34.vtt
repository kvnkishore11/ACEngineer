WEBVTT

822
00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:00.754
is the real name

823
00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:01.913
of the codebase

824
00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:03.672
structure. But normally this

825
00:17:03.672 --> 00:17:04.611
is just, you know,

826
00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:05.810
as we're engineers working

827
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.990
in codebases, This

828
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.089
is usually just called

829
00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.308
codebase structure, okay?

830
00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:10.909
And the distinction here

831
00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:11.868
is that you're not

832
00:17:11.868 --> 00:17:12.988
saying, right, you're not

833
00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:13.688
telling your agent to

834
00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:14.647
read these files. You're

835
00:17:14.647 --> 00:17:15.428
giving them a quick

836
00:17:15.428 --> 00:17:16.646
map of where the

837
00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:17.527
files are, what the

838
00:17:17.527 --> 00:17:19.205
structure looks like of

839
00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.306
the relevant code, right?

840
00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:21.086
We have a prime

841
00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:22.445
tier list here. So

842
00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:23.285
we're priming against a

843
00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:24.625
specific part of our

844
00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:26.384
application and we're specifying

845
00:17:26.384 --> 00:17:28.064
exactly what every file

846
00:17:28.064 --> 00:17:28.743
does, you know, at

847
00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:30.103
a hundred foot view.
