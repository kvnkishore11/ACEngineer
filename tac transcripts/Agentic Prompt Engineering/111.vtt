2685
00:55:29.862 --> 00:55:31.699
engineering is very important,

2686
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:32.998
but your prompts kick

2687
00:55:32.998 --> 00:55:35.230
off dictate everything you

2688
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:36.148
do so here's your

2689
00:55:36.148 --> 00:55:37.048
next move here's what

2690
00:55:37.048 --> 00:55:38.548
i recommend you focus

2691
00:55:38.548 --> 00:55:39.389
on next if you

2692
00:55:39.389 --> 00:55:40.708
haven't finished tack finish

2693
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:42.027
tack that is more

2694
00:55:42.027 --> 00:55:43.668
important than context engineering

2695
00:55:43.668 --> 00:55:44.628
is more important than

2696
00:55:44.628 --> 00:55:45.947
agenting prompt engineering that

2697
00:55:45.947 --> 00:55:47.188
sets up the future

2698
00:55:47.188 --> 00:55:48.206
of engineering it helps

2699
00:55:48.206 --> 00:55:49.706
you move toward becoming

2700
00:55:49.706 --> 00:55:51.286
an irreplaceable engineer in

2701
00:55:51.286 --> 00:55:52.626
phase two of the

2702
00:55:52.626 --> 00:55:53.925
generative ai age okay

2703
00:55:53.925 --> 00:55:55.085
so take tack next

2704
00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.286
i'm going to recommend

2705
00:55:56.418 --> 00:55:56.976
You go all the

2706
00:55:56.976 --> 00:55:57.934
way to the third

2707
00:55:57.934 --> 00:55:59.152
level and jump into

2708
00:55:59.152 --> 00:56:01.487
writing customizable agents for
