1979
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.289
do throughout this prompt.

1980
00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:30.670
But this is a

1981
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.889
powerful one. I'm giving

1982
00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:32.708
this to you here

1983
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:33.628
in this codebase

1984
00:40:33.628 --> 00:40:34.887
to spark your imagination

1985
00:40:34.887 --> 00:40:35.648
and to help you

1986
00:40:35.648 --> 00:40:37.186
build out your next

1987
00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:38.706
meta prompt, okay? We

1988
00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:39.266
can look at one

1989
00:40:39.266 --> 00:40:40.217
more here. We have

1990
00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:41.556
plan, byte view, and

1991
00:40:41.556 --> 00:40:43.135
this one's really interesting.

1992
00:40:43.135 --> 00:40:44.054
We're creating a plan

1993
00:40:44.054 --> 00:40:45.014
for building a net

1994
00:40:45.014 --> 00:40:46.913
new view three application

1995
00:40:46.913 --> 00:40:48.612
with TypeScript MVP from

1996
00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:49.670
scratch. So this is

1997
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.728
a rapid prototyping prompt.

1998
00:40:51.728 --> 00:40:52.967
And of course, same

1999
00:40:52.967 --> 00:40:53.887
old, we're not doing

2000
00:40:53.887 --> 00:40:54.766
anything new or different

2001
00:40:54.766 --> 00:40:55.487
here. We come to

2002
00:40:55.487 --> 00:40:57.025
the prompt, we collapse

2003
00:40:57.045 --> 00:40:58.523
and we understand. So

2004
00:40:58.523 --> 00:40:58.963
you can see this

2005
00:40:58.963 --> 00:41:00.402
prompt has many of
