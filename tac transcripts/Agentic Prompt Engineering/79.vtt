00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:30.615
So basically look at

1933
00:39:30.615 --> 00:39:31.775
the context map, pull

1934
00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:32.835
that stuff in and

1935
00:39:32.835 --> 00:39:34.155
then operate, right? So

1936
00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:36.153
very powerful template meta

1937
00:39:36.153 --> 00:39:37.489
prompt, to build out

1938
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.588
workflows. Okay. So this

1939
00:39:39.588 --> 00:39:40.467
is the, you know,

1940
00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:41.108
let's just be super

1941
00:39:41.108 --> 00:39:41.907
clear about this. This

1942
00:39:41.907 --> 00:39:43.547
is the most powerful

1943
00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:44.545
prompt you can write.

1944
00:39:44.545 --> 00:39:45.246
It's the prompt that

1945
00:39:45.246 --> 00:39:47.025
creates your other prompts.

1946
00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:48.125
Okay. Now again, this

1947
00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:48.684
is going to be

1948
00:39:48.684 --> 00:39:50.123
very hard to use,

1949
00:39:50.123 --> 00:39:51.023
right? Because not only

1950
00:39:51.023 --> 00:39:51.443
are you writing a

1951
00:39:51.443 --> 00:39:52.402
prompt, you're running a

1952
00:39:52.402 --> 00:39:53.402
prompt that writes your

1953
00:39:53.402 --> 00:39:55.141
prompts. But once you

1954
00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:58.019
start codifying these structures

1955
00:39:58.059 --> 00:39:58.559
and once you start

1956
00:39:58.559 --> 00:39:59.778
getting your prompt formats

1957
00:39:59.818 --> 00:40:01.757
very consistent, I highly
