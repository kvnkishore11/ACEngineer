695
00:14:29.427 --> 00:14:30.767
sections, you know exactly

696
00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:31.225
what this is gonna

697
00:14:31.225 --> 00:14:32.145
do. We do have

698
00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:34.065
a new instruction section

699
00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:34.964
here. Let's think through

700
00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:35.663
this, right? How is

701
00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:36.923
this different than the

702
00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:38.522
workflow section in your

703
00:14:38.522 --> 00:14:39.801
agentic prompts? So the

704
00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:41.159
workflow is the step-by-step

705
00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:42.720
play of exactly what

706
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.418
you want your agent

707
00:14:43.438 --> 00:14:44.918
to do. Oftentimes, your

708
00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:45.850
agent if it's a

709
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.249
Claude Code level agent,

710
00:14:47.448 --> 00:14:48.208
it's gonna come through

711
00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:49.607
and create a list,

712
00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:50.966
a concrete list inside

713
00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:52.206
of its to-dos, inside

714
00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:53.346
of its plan of

715
00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:54.505
your workflow. So this

716
00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:55.904
maps very, very well

717
00:14:55.904 --> 00:14:57.164
to modern agentic coding

718
00:14:57.164 --> 00:14:58.543
tools. As specified below,

719
00:14:58.543 --> 00:14:58.964
you can see here

720
00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.423
we're creating a specific
