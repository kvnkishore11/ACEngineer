720
00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.423
we're creating a specific

721
00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:02.822
output type. We're almost

722
00:15:02.822 --> 00:15:04.461
bleeding into the examples

723
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:05.541
section, but this is

724
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.779
just a report, okay?

725
00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:07.639
So we're just specifying

726
00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.658
the output format we

727
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.599
want. So the workflow

728
00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:11.398
is a play-by-play step

729
00:15:11.457 --> 00:15:12.236
of what we want

730
00:15:12.236 --> 00:15:12.616
done. And then the

731
00:15:12.616 --> 00:15:15.535
instructions are surrounding information

732
00:15:15.735 --> 00:15:18.214
on the individual steps

733
00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:19.352
in the workflow. So

734
00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:19.832
this is a great

735
00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:20.572
place to just come

736
00:15:20.572 --> 00:15:21.971
in and add auxiliary

737
00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:23.769
information on how your

738
00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:25.068
workflow should work. Now,

739
00:15:25.068 --> 00:15:27.006
to be clear, oftentimes

740
00:15:27.067 --> 00:15:27.985
you can just combine

741
00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:28.970
these. Right, and you

742
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.389
can create nested bullet
