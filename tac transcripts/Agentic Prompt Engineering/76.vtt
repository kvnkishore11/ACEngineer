1860
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.340
prompt, that becomes the

1861
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.581
prompt we want to

1862
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:03.380
generate. And then of

1863
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:03.960
course we have that

1864
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.898
key workflow section. Okay.

1865
00:38:05.898 --> 00:38:06.679
You can imagine exactly

1866
00:38:06.679 --> 00:38:07.737
what this does. Create

1867
00:38:07.737 --> 00:38:08.797
a new prompt. Look

1868
00:38:08.797 --> 00:38:10.697
at this XYZ. Prefer

1869
00:38:10.697 --> 00:38:11.577
this. We're basically teaching

1870
00:38:11.577 --> 00:38:12.376
our agent how to

1871
00:38:12.376 --> 00:38:14.074
build prompts. Okay. So

1872
00:38:14.074 --> 00:38:14.835
this is a prompt

1873
00:38:14.835 --> 00:38:15.755
that builds a prompt,

1874
00:38:15.795 --> 00:38:16.534
but we have a

1875
00:38:16.534 --> 00:38:18.233
couple of sections here.

1876
00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:18.612
Now we're going to

1877
00:38:18.612 --> 00:38:20.032
clarify exactly what these

1878
00:38:20.032 --> 00:38:21.472
sections are. Remember we

1879
00:38:21.472 --> 00:38:22.630
had that codebase

1880
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.851
structure also known as

1881
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:25.349
a context map. We

1882
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:26.570
also have that here

1883
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.188
with the name documentation.

1884
00:38:28.248 --> 00:38:29.668
We're explicitly calling this

1885
00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:31.188
documentation documentation, but this
