00:53:29.885 --> 00:53:31.083
You know, I'm highlighting

2601
00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:31.724
this over and over

2602
00:53:31.724 --> 00:53:32.802
for a reason. Most

2603
00:53:32.802 --> 00:53:33.862
important section you'll write

2604
00:53:33.862 --> 00:53:35.181
is the workflow, right?

2605
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:36.860
Your step-by-step play for

2606
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.960

2608
00:53:40.318 --> 00:53:41.677
are two big ideas

2609
00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:42.797

2613
00:53:46.793 --> 00:53:48.025
agents, for the best

2614
00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:50.164
results. Secondly, use consistent

2615
00:53:50.164 --> 00:53:51.583
prompt formats and their

2616
00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.940
interchangeable sections so that

2617
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.838
you can crud reusable

2618
00:53:55.838 --> 00:53:57.378
