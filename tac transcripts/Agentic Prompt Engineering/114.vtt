2752
00:56:59.617 --> 00:57:00.818
up to the powerful

2753
00:57:00.818 --> 00:57:02.277
template meta prompt, the

2754
00:57:02.277 --> 00:57:03.356
prompt that builds the

2755
00:57:03.356 --> 00:57:04.597
prompt, the agent that

2756
00:57:04.597 --> 00:57:06.056
builds the agent. This

2757
00:57:06.056 --> 00:57:07.056
is how you scale

2758
00:57:07.135 --> 00:57:08.914
hard and fast in

2759
00:57:09.112 --> 00:57:09.952
to the age of

2760
00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:10.911
agents. And this is

2761
00:57:10.911 --> 00:57:11.989
how you become an

2762
00:57:11.989 --> 00:57:13.827
agentic engineer. Great work

2763
00:57:13.827 --> 00:57:14.927
here. This codebase

2764
00:57:14.927 --> 00:57:15.286
is going to be

2765
00:57:15.286 --> 00:57:15.985
available to you. That's

2766
00:57:15.985 --> 00:57:17.403
going to be available

2767
00:57:17.463 --> 00:57:18.182
in your loot box

2768
00:57:18.182 --> 00:57:19.460
below. I'll see you

2769
00:57:19.601 --> 00:57:21.378
in the next extended

2770
00:57:21.498 --> 00:57:21.938
lesson.
