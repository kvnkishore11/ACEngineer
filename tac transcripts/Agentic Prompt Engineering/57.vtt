1395
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.339
of that framework, right?

1396
00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:30.880
So we can kick

1397
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.619
this off, right? If

1398
00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:32.578
we just clear this

1399
00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:34.357
agent out slash parallel,

1400
00:28:34.357 --> 00:28:34.877
and I'm just going

1401
00:28:34.877 --> 00:28:35.397
to paste in a

1402
00:28:35.397 --> 00:28:36.237
prompt that I have

1403
00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:36.997
here, right? I'm going

1404
00:28:36.997 --> 00:28:37.457
to paste this in,

1405
00:28:37.457 --> 00:28:39.516
extract information. We want

1406
00:28:39.536 --> 00:28:40.295
to add to our

1407
00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:41.792
claw.md that we want

1408
00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:42.791
all future agents to

1409
00:28:42.791 --> 00:28:44.230
know about essentials only

1410
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.428
present bullet list do

1411
00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:45.988
not modify the file

1412
00:28:45.988 --> 00:28:47.445
directly and we want

1413
00:28:47.445 --> 00:28:48.244
three let's say let's

1414
00:28:48.244 --> 00:28:48.604
kick it up to

1415
00:28:48.604 --> 00:28:49.403
five this is the

1416
00:28:49.403 --> 00:28:51.365
advantage of spinning up

1417
00:28:51.365 --> 00:28:52.164
more compute, right? You

1418
00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.045
just bump up the

1419
00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:54.804
number of instances, the

1420
00:28:54.804 --> 00:28:55.463
number of agents you

1421
00:28:55.463 --> 00:28:56.462
want to fire off

1422
00:28:56.462 --> 00:28:57.462
to accomplish a task.

1423
00:28:57.462 --> 00:28:58.001
And so what's the

1424
00:28:58.001 --> 00:28:58.701
advantage of running a

1425
00:28:58.701 --> 00:28:59.721
prompt like this, right?

1426
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.799
LLMs, agents, they're non-deterministic.
