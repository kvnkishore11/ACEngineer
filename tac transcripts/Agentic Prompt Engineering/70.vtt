1716
00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:01.248
we discuss in tech

1717
00:35:01.248 --> 00:35:01.887
and use quite a

1718
00:35:01.887 --> 00:35:03.297
bit. This is the

1719
00:35:03.297 --> 00:35:04.818
perfect prompt for running

1720
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:06.536
agentic workflows where there's

1721
00:35:06.536 --> 00:35:08.077
some dynamic elements that

1722
00:35:08.077 --> 00:35:09.097
you want to change

1723
00:35:09.157 --> 00:35:10.177
while having the kind

1724
00:35:10.177 --> 00:35:12.177
of top level infrastructure

1725
00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:13.135
of your prompt, the

1726
00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:14.416
higher order prompt, you

1727
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:14.976
want that to stay

1728
00:35:14.976 --> 00:35:15.876
the same. So what

1729
00:35:15.876 --> 00:35:16.695
are examples of that?

1730
00:35:16.695 --> 00:35:17.356
We can, of course,

1731
00:35:17.356 --> 00:35:18.635
open up build. Okay.

1732
00:35:18.655 --> 00:35:19.614
So once again, we're

1733
00:35:19.614 --> 00:35:20.155
back at the build

1734
00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:21.135
prompt and, you know,

1735
00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:22.655
classic format, right? There's

1736
00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:24.554
nothing new here. Metadata,

1737
00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:26.693
title, purpose, variables, workflow,

1738
00:35:26.693 --> 00:35:28.885
report, input, work output.

1739
00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:30.284
Okay. So what's going
