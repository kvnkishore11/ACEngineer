1957
00:39:59.818 --> 00:40:01.757
very consistent, I highly

1958
00:40:01.757 --> 00:40:03.398
recommend you build out

1959
00:40:03.418 --> 00:40:04.717
the prompt that generates

1960
00:40:04.717 --> 00:40:06.255
your prompts. This increases

1961
00:40:06.255 --> 00:40:08.275
your agenda engineering velocity

1962
00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:09.496
by quite a bit

1963
00:40:09.536 --> 00:40:10.815
right the prompt don't

1964
00:40:10.815 --> 00:40:11.574
forget how we started

1965
00:40:11.574 --> 00:40:12.655
this the prompt is

1966
00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:13.795
the fundamental unit of

1967
00:40:13.795 --> 00:40:15.534
engineering so engineers creating

1968
00:40:15.534 --> 00:40:17.193
more and better prompts

1969
00:40:17.193 --> 00:40:18.733
at scale are the

1970
00:40:18.733 --> 00:40:20.333
winners here level six

1971
00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:21.153
It's at level six

1972
00:40:21.153 --> 00:40:21.913
for a reason, right?

1973
00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:23.213
This is the template

1974
00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:23.972
meta prompt. You have

1975
00:40:23.972 --> 00:40:25.371
to really dig deep

1976
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:26.871
here and think through

1977
00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:27.650
what your agent is

1978
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:28.670
going to see and

1979
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.289
do throughout this prompt.
