311
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.007
Why is that? It's

312
00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:02.307
because of this workflow

313
00:07:02.307 --> 00:07:03.387
section. Let's go ahead

314
00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:04.487
and grade the workflow

315
00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:05.726
section and the workflow

316
00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:06.947
prompt just to set

317
00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:08.206
the stage to showcase

318
00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:09.225
how powerful and how

319
00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:10.305
useful this is. So

320
00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.586
workflow and throw it

321
00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:14.223
into the S usefulness.

322
00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:15.141
This is the most

323
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.759
useful section and we're

324
00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:17.158
going to throw it

325
00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.237
in C tier difficulty.

326
00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:19.214
It's actually not that

327
00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:20.665
challenging. to use the

328
00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:21.524
workflow as you'll see

329
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.204
in a second. We're

330
00:07:22.204 --> 00:07:23.303
also gonna take the

331
00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:24.843
workflow prompt and place

332
00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:25.923
it in A tier

333
00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:27.781
usefulness and C tier

334
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.242
skill requirement. So these

335
00:07:29.242 --> 00:07:30.240
are both very useful,
