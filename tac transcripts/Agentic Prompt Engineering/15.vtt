335
00:07:29.242 --> 00:07:30.240
are both very useful,

336
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.201
very powerful. And so

337
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:31.781
why is this so

338
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.459
powerful? Let's look at

339
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:33.019
one of the most

340
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.298
basic versions of this

341
00:07:34.418 --> 00:07:35.478
in the prime command.

342
00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:36.038
So this is something

343
00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:37.137
you've likely seen me

344
00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:38.497
use. The prime command

345
00:07:38.497 --> 00:07:39.896
sets up your agent

346
00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.396
to gain an understanding

347
00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.295
of the codebase

348
00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:43.095
so it can start

349
00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:43.954
working. As you can

350
00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:44.535
see here, you can

351
00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:45.853
build many prime commands

352
00:07:45.853 --> 00:07:47.072
to do and operate

353
00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:48.612
on different sections of

354
00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:49.552
your codebase. We

355
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.471
dig deeper into why

356
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:50.971
you should use a

357
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.372
prime command over classic

358
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.771
memory files and our

359
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:56.591
elite context engineering lesson.

360
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.370
Check that out if

361
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.170
you haven't. But here

362
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.610
we have several sections

363
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.430
to break down. So
