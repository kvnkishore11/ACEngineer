1102
00:22:29.377 --> 00:22:30.837
this, generate images based

1103
00:22:30.837 --> 00:22:32.196
on the provided prompt

1104
00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:33.676
using replicate MCP server.

1105
00:22:33.676 --> 00:22:34.616
We're talking to our

1106
00:22:34.616 --> 00:22:35.395
agent. We have a

1107
00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:37.256
request targeted toward our

1108
00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:38.035
agent. All right, you

1109
00:22:38.035 --> 00:22:38.755
can see here two

1110
00:22:38.755 --> 00:22:39.795
variables. Let's open up

1111
00:22:39.795 --> 00:22:40.714
our variables and you

1112
00:22:40.714 --> 00:22:41.554
can see here we're

1113
00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:42.814
using a new syntax.

1114
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:43.565
And we also have

1115
00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:44.624
a bunch of static

1116
00:22:44.644 --> 00:22:45.483
variables with a couple

1117
00:22:45.483 --> 00:22:46.242
of bullet points. Okay,

1118
00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:47.521
so let's analyze this,

1119
00:22:47.521 --> 00:22:48.181
right? So we have

1120
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.838
word plus colon, and

1121
00:22:49.838 --> 00:22:50.858
this gives us our

1122
00:22:50.858 --> 00:22:52.217
variable format. So what's

1123
00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:52.717
going on here, right?

1124
00:22:52.737 --> 00:22:53.816
We have several variables

1125
00:22:53.836 --> 00:22:54.914
and we're using Cloud

1126
00:22:54.914 --> 00:22:57.352
Code's positional argument for

1127
00:22:57.352 --> 00:22:58.590
our first arg and

1128
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.869
then our second argument.

1129
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.589
Right. So of course
