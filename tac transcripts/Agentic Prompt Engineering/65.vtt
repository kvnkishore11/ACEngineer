1596
00:32:29.692 --> 00:32:31.310
we have a simple

1597
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.650
but specific report format.

1598
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.289
And you're going to

1599
00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:35.269
see our primary agent

1600
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:36.828
return in this exact

1601
00:32:36.828 --> 00:32:38.768
report format. Okay. We

1602
00:32:38.768 --> 00:32:39.567
have one more prompt

1603
00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:41.188
here, the background prompt.

1604
00:32:41.207 --> 00:32:42.007
And you know, notice

1605
00:32:42.007 --> 00:32:43.946
how every previous level

1606
00:32:43.946 --> 00:32:45.026
stacks up, right? You

1607
00:32:45.026 --> 00:32:46.329
can Pull in whatever

1608
00:32:46.329 --> 00:32:47.308
levels you need and

1609
00:32:47.308 --> 00:32:48.269
to the highest level

1610
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:49.588
again that you need

1611
00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:50.688
to solve the problem.

1612
00:32:50.688 --> 00:32:52.028
Here we're delegating agents.

1613
00:32:52.067 --> 00:32:53.787
We're using control flow.

1614
00:32:53.807 --> 00:32:55.226
We have conditional statements.

1615
00:32:55.226 --> 00:32:55.685
You can see here

1616
00:32:55.685 --> 00:32:57.165
several ifs in our

1617
00:32:57.165 --> 00:32:58.605
workflow. And of course,

1618
00:32:58.625 --> 00:32:59.664
this is running in

1619
00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:01.084
the most powerful section
