00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:01.500
workflow, step-by-step play nested

1375
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.200
bullet points nothing fancy

1376
00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:04.579
very consistent you can

1377
00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:06.538
see just referencing variables

1378
00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:07.739
throughout but so what

1379
00:28:07.739 --> 00:28:08.498
is the key advantage

1380
00:28:08.498 --> 00:28:09.690
of this type of

1381
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.009
agentic prompt format. We

1382
00:28:11.048 --> 00:28:13.087
are handing off work

1383
00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:14.008
to compute. We're having

1384
00:28:14.008 --> 00:28:15.426
our agent fire off

1385
00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:16.467
agents. So there are

1386
00:28:16.467 --> 00:28:17.205
many ways to use

1387
00:28:17.205 --> 00:28:18.546
this. If you've already

1388
00:28:18.546 --> 00:28:20.724
taken the elite context

1389
00:28:20.724 --> 00:28:22.344
management extended lesson, you

1390
00:28:22.344 --> 00:28:23.383
already know that there

1391
00:28:23.383 --> 00:28:24.542
are only two ways

1392
00:28:24.542 --> 00:28:26.281
to context engineer, R

1393
00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:27.500
and D. And here

1394
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.901
we're using the D

1395
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.339
of that framework, right?
