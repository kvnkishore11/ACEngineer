289
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.249
require any skill. Just

290
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:31.307
type and ask for

291
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.267
what you want. Now,

292
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.526
the next prompt format

293
00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:34.166
we're gonna look at

294
00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.346
is exponentially more powerful.

295
00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:36.785
Let me show you

296
00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:38.303
exactly why. Now we

297
00:06:38.303 --> 00:06:39.803
reach level two and

298
00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:41.023
level two is a

299
00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:45.750
huge milestone. The next

300
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.589
prompt we're gonna look

301
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:47.870
at is the workflow

302
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.348
prompt. This prompt represents

303
00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:51.309
a sequential workflow with

304
00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:52.069
a bunch of new

305
00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:53.569
additional sections that you

306
00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:54.369
can work with. Out

307
00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:55.408
of all the agentic

308
00:06:55.408 --> 00:06:56.588
prompt formats we'll look

309
00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:58.007
at, this is easily

310
00:06:58.007 --> 00:06:59.127
the most important one.

311
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.007
Why is that? It's
