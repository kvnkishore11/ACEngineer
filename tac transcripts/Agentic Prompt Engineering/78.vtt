1908
00:38:59.311 --> 00:39:00.070
We talk about this

1909
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.309
at length in TAC,

1910
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:02.889
but it also allows

1911
00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:04.248
the agent to fill

1912
00:39:04.268 --> 00:39:05.907
in the blanks of

1913
00:39:05.907 --> 00:39:07.545
the specified structure. So

1914
00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.445
you can see here,

1915
00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:08.985
right, we have a

1916
00:39:08.985 --> 00:39:10.123
prompt that builds out

1917
00:39:10.123 --> 00:39:11.902
our level two workflow

1918
00:39:11.902 --> 00:39:14.262
prompt, variables, workflow, report,

1919
00:39:14.282 --> 00:39:15.041
and based on the

1920
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:16.059
high level prompt, we're

1921
00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:16.780
going to follow the

1922
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.099
instructions to create a

1923
00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:19.018
new prompt in the

1924
00:39:19.018 --> 00:39:20.956
specified format, right? And

1925
00:39:20.956 --> 00:39:22.195
here, this should be

1926
00:39:22.215 --> 00:39:23.396
follow the workflow to

1927
00:39:23.396 --> 00:39:24.514
create a new prompt

1928
00:39:24.554 --> 00:39:25.693
in a specified format.

1929
00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:26.657
All right. And before

1930
00:39:26.657 --> 00:39:27.817
you start web fetch

1931
00:39:27.836 --> 00:39:29.677
everything in documentation, right?

1932
00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:30.615
So basically look at
