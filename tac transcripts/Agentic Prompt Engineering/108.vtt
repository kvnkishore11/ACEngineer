00:53:59.755 --> 00:54:01.155
creating, reading, updating and

2622
00:54:01.175 --> 00:54:02.914
deleting your prompts at

2623
00:54:02.914 --> 00:54:03.893
light speed, at the

2624
00:54:03.893 --> 00:54:05.253
right level, usually level

2625
00:54:05.253 --> 00:54:06.313
three, level four is

2626
00:54:06.313 --> 00:54:07.072
all you need. Get

2627
00:54:07.072 --> 00:54:08.911
that great, powerful workflow

2628
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:10.331
step built inside of

2629
00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:12.471
your prompts. Be consistent

2630
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.130
with your reusable prompts

2631
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.690
so that you can

2632
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.010
fire your prompts off

2633
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.590
over and over and

2634
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:18.449
over and reduce confusion

2635
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:19.548
for yourself in the

2636
00:54:19.548 --> 00:54:20.869
future, for your team,

2637
00:54:20.889 --> 00:54:21.849
and most importantly, for

2638
00:54:21.849 --> 00:54:22.947
your agents. Your agents

2639
00:54:22.947 --> 00:54:23.788
will be able to

2640
00:54:23.788 --> 00:54:25.367
reason about many different

2641
00:54:25.367 --> 00:54:27.266
prompt structures, okay? But

2642
00:54:27.487 --> 00:54:29.206
engineering is not just

2643
00:54:29.206 --> 00:54:30.226
about your agents. It's
