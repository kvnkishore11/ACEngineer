517
00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:00.561
right? You can also

518
00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:01.980
scale them up with

519
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.480
ADWs as you've seen

520
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.561
and as we've discussed

521
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.941
at length and tack,

522
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:06.960
but the variable section

523
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.500
is ultra important because

524
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.220
now we're parsing the

525
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.519
claw code arguments syntax

526
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.360
here and in our

527
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.239
prompt, when this gets

528
00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.318
executed, this is going

529
00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:15.119
to update so that

530
00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:16.198
whatever the value is

531
00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.038
here, right? Right. So

532
00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:18.178
path to plan and

533
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:18.979
then check this out.

534
00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.817
We are referencing the

535
00:11:20.817 --> 00:11:22.238
name of our variable

536
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:24.229
throughout our prompt, okay?

537
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.927
Variables let you pass

538
00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:27.586
information into your prompts.

539
00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:28.326
Here we're building up

540
00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.485
our own easy to

541
00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:31.565
understand natural language variable
