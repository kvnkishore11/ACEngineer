1426
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.799
LLMs, agents, they're non-deterministic.

1427
00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:02.559
So when you ask

1428
00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:04.159
multiple agents to do

1429
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.298
something, they're going to

1430
00:29:05.298 --> 00:29:07.518
return with different results,

1431
00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:08.457
okay? And you can

1432
00:29:08.457 --> 00:29:09.257
see here, we're firing

1433
00:29:09.257 --> 00:29:10.635
up five agents focused

1434
00:29:10.635 --> 00:29:12.255
on a different aspect

1435
00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:12.875
of the codebase.

1436
00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:14.134
So our primary agent

1437
00:29:14.134 --> 00:29:16.285
is instructing the sub

1438
00:29:16.285 --> 00:29:17.564
agents, right? Our primary

1439
00:29:17.564 --> 00:29:18.864
agent is the prompt

1440
00:29:18.864 --> 00:29:20.242
engineer for our sub

1441
00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:21.642
agents. And this is

1442
00:29:21.642 --> 00:29:22.342
where things get really

1443
00:29:22.342 --> 00:29:23.820
tricky, right? This, you

1444
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.220
know, agent delegation is

1445
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.220
very powerful, but it's

1446
00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:27.098
hard to use. Let's

1447
00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:27.638
go ahead and grade

1448
00:29:27.638 --> 00:29:28.479
this right now. So

1449
00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:29.978
we have the delegate

1450
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:30.777
prompt and I'm gonna
