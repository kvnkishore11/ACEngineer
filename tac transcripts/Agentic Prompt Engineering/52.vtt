1279
00:25:59.821 --> 00:26:01.261
base64 command isn't available,

1280
00:26:01.261 --> 00:26:02.361
exit immediately, right? This

1281
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:03.839
prompt does a specific

1282
00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:04.720
thing in a specific

1283
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.637
workflow very well with

1284
00:26:06.637 --> 00:26:07.516
a loop embedded. All

1285
00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:09.114
right, that's the control

1286
00:26:09.114 --> 00:26:10.652
flow prompt. Now we

1287
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:11.951
continue to scale up

1288
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:12.769
what we can do

1289
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:14.686
with our agents while

1290
00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:16.365
properly communicating to the

1291
00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:17.823
trifecta. Let's go to

1292
00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:21.442
level four. So at

1293
00:26:21.442 --> 00:26:22.561
level four, we have

1294
00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:24.321
the delegation prompt, right?

1295
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.861
The delegate prompt. This

1296
00:26:25.861 --> 00:26:27.000
is a prompt that

1297
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.540
kicks off other agents

1298
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.901
to do work. Notice

1299
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:31.320
how distinct every one
