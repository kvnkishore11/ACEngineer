00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.950
title, metadata, workflow, relevant

114
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.210
files, codebase structure.

115
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.870
And we have our

116
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.008
list of prompts that

117
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:05.709
we're going to work

118
00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.288
through. The prompt is

119
00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:09.407
everything. Context engineering is

120
00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:10.768
incredibly important, but we

121
00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:12.127
can't forget about the

122
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:14.367
underlying skill that dictates

123
00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:16.407
everything, the prompt, and

124
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.287
now the agentic prompt.

125
00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:19.447
What we're doing here

126
00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.306
is learning how to

127
00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:22.227
best communicate what we

128
00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:23.926
want to the trifecta,

129
00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:25.287
you, your team, and

130
00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:26.566
your agents. Let's level

131
00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:28.086
up our agentic prompt

132
00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.246
engineering abilities by mastering
