417
00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.778
belongs in C tier

418
00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:02.277
usefulness and C tier

419
00:09:02.356 --> 00:09:04.096
skill requirement. Metadata lets

420
00:09:04.096 --> 00:09:04.697
you do a couple

421
00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:05.956
powerful things. You'll see

422
00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.035
in upcoming prompts like

423
00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:08.455
specify the exact tools

424
00:09:08.455 --> 00:09:09.375
or the exact models

425
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:10.134
that you want, but

426
00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:11.034
other than that, it's

427
00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:12.734
not all that valuable.

428
00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:13.313
And we also have

429
00:09:13.313 --> 00:09:14.433
the report section. Now

430
00:09:14.433 --> 00:09:15.254
the report section is

431
00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:15.972
gonna be quite a

432
00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.192
bit more valuable. The

433
00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:18.352
report section lets you

434
00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:19.892
change the way your

435
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.552
agent responds to you.

436
00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:23.552
Anything from running strictly

437
00:09:23.552 --> 00:09:25.410
in JSON output, YAML

438
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.530
output, or to report

439
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.630
in a specific structure

440
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.909
or to include specific

441
00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:30.409
information in the report,
