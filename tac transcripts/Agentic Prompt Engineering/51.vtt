1251
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:30.310
input, workflow, output. If

1252
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.911
you don't care about

1253
00:25:30.911 --> 00:25:31.830
your output or if

1254
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.890
you don't need variables

1255
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:33.930
coming in, don't add

1256
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.253
the section. Okay, this

1257
00:25:35.253 --> 00:25:35.972
is the key to

1258
00:25:35.972 --> 00:25:37.413
writing great prompts. Only

1259
00:25:37.413 --> 00:25:38.451
add what you need,

1260
00:25:38.471 --> 00:25:39.471
right? These are composable

1261
00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.250
pieces of your agentic

1262
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.849
prompts. Okay, so the

1263
00:25:42.849 --> 00:25:43.809
edit image has no

1264
00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:44.808
output format. And so

1265
00:25:44.808 --> 00:25:45.328
you can see a

1266
00:25:45.328 --> 00:25:46.269
same deal here. If

1267
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:47.288
we open everything up,

1268
00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:48.567
we have variables and

1269
00:25:48.567 --> 00:25:49.666
we have a workflow

1270
00:25:49.707 --> 00:25:50.865
and our workflow has

1271
00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:52.385
a loop embedded inside

1272
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:53.065
of it. All right,

1273
00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:53.785
and we also have

1274
00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.044
a stop command here,

1275
00:25:55.163 --> 00:25:56.564
right? A couple conditionals,

1276
00:25:56.644 --> 00:25:57.163
you know, if the

1277
00:25:57.163 --> 00:25:58.323
token is not available,

1278
00:25:58.343 --> 00:25:59.821
exit immediately. If the

1279
00:25:59.821 --> 00:26:01.261
base64 command isn't available,
