2437
00:49:59.072 --> 00:50:00.012
A bad system prompt

2438
00:50:00.012 --> 00:50:01.132
is bad instructions for

2439
00:50:01.132 --> 00:50:02.452
the whole job, okay?

2440
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.070
The whole job. Writing

2441
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:04.949
this right is critically

2442
00:50:04.949 --> 00:50:05.730
important. You know, we

2443
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.469
talked about a couple

2444
00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:07.949
key sections for our

2445
00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:09.168
user prompts and to

2446
00:50:09.168 --> 00:50:10.447
be super clear every

2447
00:50:10.447 --> 00:50:11.507
section we broke down

2448
00:50:11.527 --> 00:50:12.567
here in our tier

2449
00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:13.907
list, we're grading this

2450
00:50:13.927 --> 00:50:15.985
specifically for user prompts,

2451
00:50:16.065 --> 00:50:16.945
right? All of your

2452
00:50:16.945 --> 00:50:18.565
Claude Code prompts, right?

2453
00:50:18.565 --> 00:50:19.025
And all of your

2454
00:50:19.025 --> 00:50:20.405
prompts that run in

2455
00:50:20.405 --> 00:50:21.724
your agent, these go

2456
00:50:21.724 --> 00:50:23.344
into your context window

2457
00:50:23.364 --> 00:50:24.784
as a user prompt,

2458
00:50:24.903 --> 00:50:25.784
okay? These are user

2459
00:50:25.784 --> 00:50:26.983
prompts. Let's be super

2460
00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:28.402
clear. Your system prompts,

2461
00:50:28.402 --> 00:50:29.302
we only have like

2462
00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:30.503
four system prompts in
