151
00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:00.076
prompt examples here we're

152
00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:01.037
gonna work through as

153
00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:02.296
we progress through each

154
00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.675
level of our agentic

155
00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:04.936
prompt formats. Let's start

156
00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:06.155
with all tools. So

157
00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:07.675
inside the agentic prompt

158
00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:08.775
engineering codebase, we

159
00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.213
have the simple list

160
00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:11.514
all tools prompt and

161
00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:12.674
it does exactly what

162
00:04:12.674 --> 00:04:13.252
you think it does.

163
00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.332
We're asking our agent

164
00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:15.193
to look at their

165
00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:16.651
system prompt and list

166
00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:17.831
all of their tools.

167
00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:19.091
This has just two

168
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.930
sections, title and the

169
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.110
high level prompt. And

170
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.850
we can of course

171
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.170
kick open a new

172
00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:25.982
Claude Code instance run

173
00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:27.701
all tab and kick

174
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.581
this off. There's a

175
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:29.720
typical classic prompt. It

176
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.740
helps you understand what
