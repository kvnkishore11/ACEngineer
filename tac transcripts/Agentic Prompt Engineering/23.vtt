541
00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:31.565
understand natural language variable

542
00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:32.884
syntax that we can

543
00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:34.562
reference throughout the prompt,

544
00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:36.422
okay? And powerful modern

545
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:37.833
language models running in

546
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:39.192
these agents. They're powerful

547
00:11:39.192 --> 00:11:40.393
enough to know exactly

548
00:11:40.393 --> 00:11:41.111
what you mean when

549
00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:42.351
you keep referencing it,

550
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:44.750
especially in this syntax,

551
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.690
right? This consistent syntax.

552
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.389
Not only is this

553
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:48.129
great for your agent,

554
00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:48.849
it is of course

555
00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:49.888
great for you and

556
00:11:49.888 --> 00:11:50.788
your team. Look at

557
00:11:50.788 --> 00:11:51.626
how easy this is

558
00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:52.986
to understand, right? We

559
00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:53.826
have a variable coming

560
00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:54.765
in and this is

561
00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:55.865
the path to the

562
00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.365
plan, okay? So very

563
00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:58.144
powerful stuff here. This

564
00:11:58.144 --> 00:11:59.744
is a dynamic variable

565
00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:01.202
in contrast to a
