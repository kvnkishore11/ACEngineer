72
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.179
more work to compute

73
00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.778
and setting up systems

74
00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:03.438
that trigger your workflow

75
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.876
so your presence isn't

76
00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:05.677
needed. You want to

77
00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:07.516
be building AFK agents.

78
00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:08.376
And this all comes

79
00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:09.775
back to the skill

80
00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:10.935
that was once mocked

81
00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.093
as a joke, prompt

82
00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:13.174
engineering. But things have

83
00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.712
changed. We're now agentic

84
00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.532
prompt engineering. And every

85
00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:18.651
prompt you write, every

86
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:19.811
line that goes into

87
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:20.911
your prompt has the

88
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:22.701
ability to call Tens

89
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.778
and hundreds of tool

90
00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.276
calls and run from

91
00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.115
minutes to hours. This

92
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.872
makes a gigantic prompt

93
00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.230
engineering one of the
