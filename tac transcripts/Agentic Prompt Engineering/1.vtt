12
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.681
do you consistently create

13
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.100
prompts that deliver two,

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.520
five, 10, 100X returns

15
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.899
on your time investment?

16
00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.518
The answer starts with

17
00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:39.457
a senior engineering mindset

18
00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:40.337
shift. You have to

19
00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:41.415
ask yourself, who am

20
00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:43.115
I creating these prompts

21
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:44.215
for? It's not just

22
00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:44.755
for you. It's not

23
00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:45.973
just for your team.

24
00:00:46.073 --> 00:00:47.753
We're now engineering for

25
00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:50.012
three audiences, you, your

26
00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.171
team, your agents. This

27
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:54.231
is the stakeholder trifecta

28
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.371
for the age of

29
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:56.511
agents. This is the

30
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:58.310
agentic shift that most

31
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.030
engineers haven't yet made.
