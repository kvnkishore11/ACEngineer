616
00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:01.597
directly talking to our

617
00:13:01.597 --> 00:13:02.956
agent. All right. And

618
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:03.996
so by contrast, by

619
00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:04.816
having this very kind

620
00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:06.554
of dry, direct language,

621
00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.615
you and any engineer

622
00:13:07.615 --> 00:13:08.235
on your team can

623
00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:09.033
come to this prompt

624
00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:10.616
and collapse everything and

625
00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:11.937
just read this upper

626
00:13:11.937 --> 00:13:13.816
section to understand exactly

627
00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:15.095
what this does, right?

628
00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:16.534
And what the capabilities

629
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:17.094
are. Then you can

630
00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:17.974
just dial in one

631
00:13:17.974 --> 00:13:18.553
piece at a time,

632
00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:18.994
right? So what are

633
00:13:18.994 --> 00:13:20.052
the variables here? You

634
00:13:20.052 --> 00:13:20.613
can see here we

635
00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:21.692
have that user prompt

636
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:22.371
coming in as the

637
00:13:22.371 --> 00:13:23.350
argument and we have

638
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.110
the plan output directory.

639
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.110
Now this is different,

640
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.669
right? You can see

641
00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:27.548
how different this is.

642
00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:28.908
This is a static

643
00:13:28.969 --> 00:13:29.847
variable. This is a

644
00:13:29.847 --> 00:13:31.548
variable we're placing right
