2031
00:41:29.061 --> 00:41:30.360
created. A very powerful

2032
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.000
prompt. You can see

2033
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.260
here, we're stacking up

2034
00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.518
and swapping in a

2035
00:41:33.518 --> 00:41:34.739
lot of our sections,

2036
00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:35.737
right? So this is

2037
00:41:35.737 --> 00:41:37.615
the, template section. So

2038
00:41:37.815 --> 00:41:39.333
again, very powerful, very

2039
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:40.532
hard to use really

2040
00:41:40.532 --> 00:41:42.208
this belongs right underneath

2041
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:43.226
the template meta prompt

2042
00:41:43.327 --> 00:41:44.226
as it should write

2043
00:41:44.226 --> 00:41:44.744
this is hard to

2044
00:41:44.744 --> 00:41:45.742
do, but it gives

2045
00:41:45.742 --> 00:41:46.880
you a lot right

2046
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.420
this will pay you

2047
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.458
back massive dividends for

2048
00:41:49.478 --> 00:41:50.336
every prompt you write

2049
00:41:50.336 --> 00:41:50.817
that you can have

2050
00:41:50.817 --> 00:41:51.976
your agent create for

2051
00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:52.775
you, all right? We

2052
00:41:52.775 --> 00:41:53.835
start delegating to other

2053
00:41:53.835 --> 00:41:54.695
agents and we start

2054
00:41:54.695 --> 00:41:56.313
looping our agents back

2055
00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.773
onto themselves, so to

2056
00:41:57.773 --> 00:41:58.813
speak, all right? That's

2057
00:41:58.813 --> 00:41:59.811
the template meta prompt,

2058
00:41:59.952 --> 00:42:01.550
very, very powerful prompt
