2412
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:30.780
a specific system prompt.

2413
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:31.420
This is what we'll

2414
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.501
dive into in our

2415
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:34.318
next extended lesson, we're

2416
00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:35.893
going to build specific

2417
00:49:35.893 --> 00:49:36.969
agents where we're going

2418
00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:38.047
to blow away the

2419
00:49:38.047 --> 00:49:40.121
entire system prompt to

2420
00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:41.581
solve your domain specific

2421
00:49:41.581 --> 00:49:43.061
problem better than the

2422
00:49:43.081 --> 00:49:44.099
out of the box

2423
00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:45.378
Claude Code agent can

2424
00:49:45.378 --> 00:49:46.818
or really any agent.

2425
00:49:46.838 --> 00:49:47.318
This is the big

2426
00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:48.398
difference, right? The system

2427
00:49:48.398 --> 00:49:49.737
prompt is orders of

2428
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:51.617
magnitude, probably, you know,

2429
00:49:51.715 --> 00:49:52.496
depending on how much

2430
00:49:52.496 --> 00:49:53.255
you use it, we'll

2431
00:49:53.255 --> 00:49:54.454
just say one order

2432
00:49:54.454 --> 00:49:55.735
of magnitude more important.

2433
00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:56.333
Really, I think it's

2434
00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:57.054
more like two or

2435
00:49:57.054 --> 00:49:58.253
three. Why this matters

2436
00:49:58.253 --> 00:49:59.072
is pretty simple, right?

2437
00:49:59.072 --> 00:50:00.012
A bad system prompt
