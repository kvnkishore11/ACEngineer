390
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.810
want our agent to

391
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.408
do just this, right?

392
00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:32.989
We can of course

393
00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:33.707
spin up an agent

394
00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:35.067
to run this whenever

395
00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:35.466
we want to. It's

396
00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:37.067
gonna do just these

397
00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.326
two things, right? And

398
00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:39.105
we're setting it up

399
00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:40.625
in the purpose, execute

400
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:41.845
the workflow and report

401
00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:42.783
sections to understand the

402
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.143
codebase and summarize

403
00:08:44.143 --> 00:08:45.322
your understanding. So let's

404
00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:46.003
go ahead and grade

405
00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:46.942
the metadata and the

406
00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:48.500
report section. So metadata

407
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.480
is important, but it

408
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.360
doesn't actually do a

409
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.919
whole lot for your

410
00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.080
prompt, for your team,

411
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.139
and for your agent.

412
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.719
It's not completely useless,

413
00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:56.479
but out of all

414
00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:57.398
the sections and out

415
00:08:57.398 --> 00:08:58.038
of all the prompts

416
00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.118
we'll look at, metadata

417
00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.778
belongs in C tier
