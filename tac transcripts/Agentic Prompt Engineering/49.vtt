1202
00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:30.826
more complex, right? We're

1203
00:24:30.826 --> 00:24:31.727
doing more and more

1204
00:24:31.727 --> 00:24:32.787
with our prompts. Of

1205
00:24:32.787 --> 00:24:34.067
course, have the report

1206
00:24:34.067 --> 00:24:35.586
generates images at scale

1207
00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:36.666
for us in a

1208
00:24:36.666 --> 00:24:37.905
loop. Let's go ahead

1209
00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:39.246
and rank this. When

1210
00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:39.826
it comes down to

1211
00:24:39.846 --> 00:24:40.365
it, you know, the

1212
00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:41.905
conditional flow prompt I

1213
00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:42.885
would say is about

1214
00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:44.585
as powerful, probably a

1215
00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.144
little bit more powerful,

1216
00:24:46.243 --> 00:24:47.423
more useful than the

1217
00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:48.863
workflow prompt, right? There's

1218
00:24:48.863 --> 00:24:49.643
probably a little bit

1219
00:24:49.643 --> 00:24:51.122
above this. It is

1220
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:52.601
gonna be more challenging

1221
00:24:52.601 --> 00:24:53.780
though. It requires more

1222
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.880
skill to think through

1223
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.739
and analyze the workflow

1224
00:24:56.739 --> 00:24:57.679
step in your prompt

1225
00:24:57.699 --> 00:24:59.438
to understand the control

1226
00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:00.917
flow that your prompt
