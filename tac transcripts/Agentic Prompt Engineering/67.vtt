1645
00:33:29.393 --> 00:33:30.873
out your agentic prompts,

1646
00:33:30.913 --> 00:33:31.992
right? One more here,

1647
00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:32.672
we have the background

1648
00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:34.451
prompt. Once again, I

1649
00:33:34.451 --> 00:33:35.791
hope you're getting annoyed

1650
00:33:36.571 --> 00:33:38.271
and kind of bored

1651
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:39.611
of this workflow, but

1652
00:33:39.611 --> 00:33:40.310
this is how you

1653
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.431
write great prompts at

1654
00:33:41.431 --> 00:33:42.550
scale over and over

1655
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.250
and over for you,

1656
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.171
your team and your

1657
00:33:44.171 --> 00:33:46.330
agents. You stay consistent,

1658
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.990
okay? Metadata, title, purpose,

1659
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.549
right? We're using that

1660
00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:51.305
direct language run a

1661
00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:52.484
Claude Code instance in

1662
00:33:52.484 --> 00:33:53.523
the background to perform

1663
00:33:53.523 --> 00:33:55.163
tasks autonomously while you

1664
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:56.762
continue working. Okay, purpose

1665
00:33:56.843 --> 00:33:58.261
clearly defined one or

1666
00:33:58.261 --> 00:33:59.921
two sentences variables here
