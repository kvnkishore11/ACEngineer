1694
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:30.431
agent is going to

1695
00:34:30.431 --> 00:34:32.231
kick off another primary

1696
00:34:32.231 --> 00:34:33.590
agent in the background.

1697
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.570
And this agent is

1698
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.710
going to continue to

1699
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.190
report to a report

1700
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.489
file as it works

1701
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.829
in the background using

1702
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:41.170
whatever model we specify.

1703
00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:43.344
All right. This is

1704
00:34:43.525 --> 00:34:45.103
the delegation prompt, right?

1705
00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:46.541
The delegate prompt. You

1706
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:47.661
can have your agent

1707
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.079
pass off work to

1708
00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:50.818
other agents. Okay? Let's

1709
00:34:50.818 --> 00:34:51.456
move up the stack

1710
00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:52.356
again. Let's add more

1711
00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.135
power to every one

1712
00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:54.114
of our prompts. Let's

1713
00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:54.893
move up to level

1714
00:34:54.914 --> 00:34:58.710
five. Level five is

1715
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.869
interesting. It's a concept

1716
00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:01.248
we discuss in tech
