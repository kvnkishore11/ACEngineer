1788
00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:30.309
gonna put this in

1789
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:31.568
B tier for useful

1790
00:36:31.568 --> 00:36:33.387
and ATF or difficulty.

1791
00:36:33.387 --> 00:36:34.465
This is very powerful

1792
00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:35.005
if you know what

1793
00:36:35.005 --> 00:36:36.226
you're doing. The most

1794
00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:37.605
obvious higher order prompt

1795
00:36:37.605 --> 00:36:38.443
you can create is

1796
00:36:38.443 --> 00:36:39.403
the one that just

1797
00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:40.643
builds the work into

1798
00:36:40.643 --> 00:36:41.782
your codebase based

1799
00:36:41.782 --> 00:36:42.382
on the plan, all

1800
00:36:42.422 --> 00:36:43.681
right? So this is

1801
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:45.141
the higher order prompt,

1802
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:47.239
providing a consistent structure

1803
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.318
so your lower level

1804
00:36:48.318 --> 00:36:49.818
prompt can be changed

1805
00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:51.378
and updated and operated

1806
00:36:51.378 --> 00:36:52.396
on, all right? Let's

1807
00:36:52.396 --> 00:36:52.896
move on to level

1808
00:36:52.896 --> 00:36:56.835
six. At level six,

1809
00:36:56.835 --> 00:36:58.494
we have the template

1810
00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.128
Meta Prompt. Now, this
