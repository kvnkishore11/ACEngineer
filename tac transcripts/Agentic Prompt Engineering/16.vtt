363
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.430
to break down. So

364
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.071
we have this brand

365
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.930
new metadata section and

366
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.451
this is specifically metadata

367
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.011
for Claude Code. But

368
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:07.730
other agents and tools

369
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.331
you work with will

370
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.310
have their own version

371
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.091
of this. But here

372
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:10.449
we just have a

373
00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:11.670
simple description. We have

374
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.930
our same title. We

375
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.490
have our purpose here.

376
00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:15.089
And below we have

377
00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:16.230
two new sections, right?

378
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.250
We have the workflow

379
00:08:17.473 --> 00:08:18.110
and we have the

380
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.805
report. The workflow section

381
00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:20.920
is exactly as you

382
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.494
think. The key here

383
00:08:22.494 --> 00:08:22.973
is that it's a

384
00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:25.351
sequential list of tasks

385
00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:26.112
that you want your

386
00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:27.190
agent to execute to

387
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.211
get the job done.

388
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:29.069
So whenever we run

389
00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:29.970
our prime command, we

390
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.810
want our agent to
