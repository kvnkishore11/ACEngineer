1450
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:30.777
prompt and I'm gonna

1451
00:29:30.777 --> 00:29:31.356
go ahead and throw

1452
00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:33.056
this into S tier

1453
00:29:33.056 --> 00:29:34.634
usefulness while being in

1454
00:29:34.714 --> 00:29:37.193
A tier skill difficulty.

1455
00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:37.773
Okay. This is an

1456
00:29:37.773 --> 00:29:38.972
advanced technique. Why is

1457
00:29:38.972 --> 00:29:39.512
that? It's because we're

1458
00:29:39.512 --> 00:29:42.111
managing multiple instances of

1459
00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:43.650
agents and we're writing

1460
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.865
prompts that write prompts,

1461
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:47.403
right? We are specifically

1462
00:29:47.403 --> 00:29:48.982
saying, right, we're talking

1463
00:29:48.982 --> 00:29:49.981
to our primary agent.

1464
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:50.701
In step two of

1465
00:29:50.701 --> 00:29:51.681
our workflow, we're saying

1466
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.119
design agent prompts, create

1467
00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:55.058
detailed self-contained prompts for

1468
00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:56.718
each agent. Include specific

1469
00:29:56.718 --> 00:29:58.935
instructions, define clear output

1470
00:29:58.955 --> 00:30:00.674
expectations, okay? We're really
