176
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.740
helps you understand what

177
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.718
your agent can see.

178
00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.338
By the way, you

179
00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:32.918
can run this in

180
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.557
any chat interface, any

181
00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:35.976
agent to understand what

182
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:36.656
they can do. We

183
00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:37.476
have a title and

184
00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.656
a high level prompt.

185
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:39.355
These prompts are going

186
00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:39.836
to stack up on

187
00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:40.535
each other, but let's

188
00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:41.235
go ahead and just

189
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.153
place our first two

190
00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:44.173
sections. We have the

191
00:04:44.173 --> 00:04:45.452
title. How useful is

192
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.392
this and how much

193
00:04:46.392 --> 00:04:47.213
skill do you need

194
00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:48.492
to operate the title

195
00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:49.911
section of your agentic

196
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:51.511
prompts? Not much and

197
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.149
not very, right? So,

198
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.810
I'm gonna throw the

199
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.028
title down here in

200
00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.329
the C tier for

201
00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.827
usefulness and D tier

202
00:04:57.827 --> 00:04:59.646
for skill requirement. We

203
00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:00.206
also have the high
