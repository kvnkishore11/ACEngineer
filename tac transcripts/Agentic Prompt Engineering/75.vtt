1837
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.588
engineering, okay? This is

1838
00:37:30.588 --> 00:37:32.487
a big, crucial idea.

1839
00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:33.545
We go at links

1840
00:37:33.545 --> 00:37:35.623
discussing in TAC, okay?

1841
00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:36.563
Why is that? It's

1842
00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:38.360
because in your templates,

1843
00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:39.780
you can teach your

1844
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.358
agents how to build

1845
00:37:41.518 --> 00:37:42.577
like you and your

1846
00:37:42.577 --> 00:37:43.516
team builds. You know,

1847
00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:44.235
we have team at

1848
00:37:44.235 --> 00:37:45.215
a prompt workflow. Let's

1849
00:37:45.215 --> 00:37:45.954
just look at this.

1850
00:37:45.954 --> 00:37:47.032
There's a powerful prompt

1851
00:37:47.052 --> 00:37:47.931
that builds a prompt,

1852
00:37:47.952 --> 00:37:49.829
but you'll notice exact

1853
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.668
Same format with a

1854
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:52.887
couple of changes here

1855
00:37:52.887 --> 00:37:53.806
with a couple pieces

1856
00:37:53.806 --> 00:37:54.746
that are important, all

1857
00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:56.784
right? Metadata, title, purpose,

1858
00:37:56.784 --> 00:37:58.382
variables, where we're passing

1859
00:37:58.382 --> 00:37:59.402
in that high level

1860
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.340
prompt, that becomes the
