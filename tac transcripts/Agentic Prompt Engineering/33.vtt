WEBVTT

794
00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:30.457
have one additional section

795
00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.437
here and we have

796
00:16:31.437 --> 00:16:32.616
no metadata. So notice

797
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:33.917
this format, right? Title

798
00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:35.056
purpose. And then we

799
00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.870
have code-based structure This

800
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.389
is a distinct section.

801
00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:39.548
We have our workflow

802
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:40.288
and you can see

803
00:16:40.288 --> 00:16:41.047
our workflow is getting

804
00:16:41.047 --> 00:16:41.787
a little bit more

805
00:16:41.787 --> 00:16:42.745
complex here. We'll break

806
00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:43.086
that down in a

807
00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.164
second. And we have

808
00:16:44.164 --> 00:16:45.163
our report. Okay, so

809
00:16:45.163 --> 00:16:45.703
just a kind of

810
00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:47.243
super simple blank report.

811
00:16:47.243 --> 00:16:47.743
Let's go ahead and

812
00:16:47.743 --> 00:16:48.522
talk about the code

813
00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:49.921
base structure. What is

814
00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:51.399
this new section? Another

815
00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:52.438
way to think about

816
00:16:52.438 --> 00:16:53.479
the codebase structure

817
00:16:53.499 --> 00:16:54.357
section that you can

818
00:16:54.357 --> 00:16:55.456
swap in and out

819
00:16:55.456 --> 00:16:56.677
of your agentic prompts.

820
00:16:56.836 --> 00:16:57.855
This is really a

821
00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.615
context map, right? This

822
00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:00.754
is the real name
