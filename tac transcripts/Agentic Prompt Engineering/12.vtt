259
00:05:59.274 --> 00:06:00.492
write a purpose just

260
00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:01.533
say what you're trying

261
00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:02.312
to do as you

262
00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:02.853
can see here the

263
00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:03.733
high level prompt is

264
00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:04.793
very simple this is

265
00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:05.432
a great place to

266
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:06.432
start it's a terrible

267
00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.672
place to end whenever

268
00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:08.831
you start doing repeat

269
00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:09.971
work hand it off

270
00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:10.992
to your agent right

271
00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:11.750
three times marks a

272
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.471
pattern copy whatever you're

273
00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:14.271
doing and just write

274
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.271
it as a high

275
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.951
level prompt and then

276
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:17.769
move up the levels

277
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:18.649
from there all right

278
00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:19.089
so in terms of

279
00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.973
usefulness and difficulty We're

280
00:06:20.973 --> 00:06:21.413
gonna go ahead and

281
00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:22.312
grade the high level

282
00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:23.353
prompt in the exact

283
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:24.552
same tier list here.

284
00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:24.992
So you can get

285
00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:25.711
decent value out of

286
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:26.670
the high level prompt

287
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.149
without putting in much

288
00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.910
effort, right? This doesn't

289
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.249
require any skill. Just
