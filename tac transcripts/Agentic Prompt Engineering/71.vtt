1739
00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:30.284
Okay. So what's going

1740
00:35:30.284 --> 00:35:30.844
on here, paths of

1741
00:35:30.844 --> 00:35:31.603
the plan. The big

1742
00:35:31.623 --> 00:35:32.463
key with the build

1743
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.003
prompt with these higher

1744
00:35:34.003 --> 00:35:35.023
order prompts is that

1745
00:35:35.023 --> 00:35:36.021
we are passing in

1746
00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.001
prompts into prompts. Okay.

1747
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.081
This is a distinguishing

1748
00:35:39.101 --> 00:35:41.139
capability of your prompts.

1749
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.099
This allows your prompts

1750
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.719
to scaffold top level

1751
00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:45.418
information while you pass

1752
00:35:45.418 --> 00:35:47.036
in work, right? Or

1753
00:35:47.036 --> 00:35:47.976
plans in this case,

1754
00:35:47.976 --> 00:35:48.835
right? We're passing in

1755
00:35:48.996 --> 00:35:50.016
plans that we build

1756
00:35:50.076 --> 00:35:51.755
directly in as a

1757
00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:53.273
variable. Okay. And so

1758
00:35:53.273 --> 00:35:53.994
you know what this

1759
00:35:53.994 --> 00:35:54.514
looks like. We don't

1760
00:35:54.514 --> 00:35:54.972
need to go over

1761
00:35:54.972 --> 00:35:55.592
this, but we could

1762
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:56.413
do, you know, slash

1763
00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:58.032
build and then pass

1764
00:35:58.112 --> 00:35:59.271
a path to a

1765
00:35:59.271 --> 00:35:59.951
plan, right? Which is

1766
00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:00.610
going to be in
