93
00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.230
engineering one of the

94
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.448
most important skills for

95
00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:35.205
engineers to focus and

96
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.723
master. And of course,

97
00:02:36.804 --> 00:02:37.603
that's what we're talking

98
00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:38.961
about today, right here,

99
00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:40.040
right now. We're going

100
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860
to understand the seven

101
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.699
most powerful agentic prompt

102
00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.837
formats and most importantly,

103
00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.116
the exact sections that

104
00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:49.016
make them up. We're

105
00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:49.796
talking about the most

106
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.216
useful sections for your

107
00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.414
prompts and how challenging

108
00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:54.614
they are to operate,

109
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.533
how much skill you

110
00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:56.673
need to operate, not

111
00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:58.252
just the prompts themselves,

112
00:02:58.252 --> 00:02:59.872
but the individual sections,

113
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.950
title, metadata, workflow, relevant
