644
00:13:29.847 --> 00:13:31.548
variable we're placing right

645
00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:32.447
in the prompt that

646
00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:34.066
doesn't change. You can't

647
00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:35.066
pass anything in to

648
00:13:35.066 --> 00:13:36.245
overwrite this. This is

649
00:13:36.245 --> 00:13:37.504
a powerful static variable

650
00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:38.724
versus a the user

651
00:13:38.724 --> 00:13:40.683
prompt. a dynamic variable,

652
00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:42.383
right? That changes as

653
00:13:42.383 --> 00:13:43.322
you pass in work.

654
00:13:43.363 --> 00:13:44.361
This prompt is going

655
00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:45.381
to write to the

656
00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:46.601
specs directory, right? And

657
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:47.022
if you want to,

658
00:13:47.022 --> 00:13:47.600
you can change this

659
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.520
to be anything you

660
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.581
want. So say you

661
00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:51.080
like PRDs, right? This

662
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.860
will write to the

663
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.240
PRD directory, right? All

664
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.698
you have to do

665
00:13:53.698 --> 00:13:54.739
is update this, save

666
00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:55.798
it, and that's it,

667
00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:56.239
right? You don't have

668
00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:57.317
to keep referencing this

669
00:13:57.317 --> 00:13:58.398
everywhere. And of course,

670
00:13:58.518 --> 00:13:59.597
We can copy this

671
00:13:59.597 --> 00:14:00.697
and do a search
