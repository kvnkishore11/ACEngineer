899
00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:30.266
throw this right under

900
00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.326
metadata, right? Code base

901
00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:32.484
structure is about C

902
00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:34.304
tier usefulness and it's

903
00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:35.343
not that challenging to

904
00:18:35.343 --> 00:18:36.482
use. We're just giving

905
00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.501
a codebase structure.

906
00:18:37.602 --> 00:18:38.320
and we're asking for

907
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.780
a little bit of

908
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.919
detail, all right? But

909
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.637
now the important interesting

910
00:18:41.637 --> 00:18:42.336
thing here is our

911
00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:43.476
workflow. If we look

912
00:18:43.476 --> 00:18:44.773
at our workflow via

913
00:18:44.773 --> 00:18:46.212
regex, we have a

914
00:18:46.232 --> 00:18:47.530
more built out list.

915
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.190
And so your workflow

916
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.509
can be as detailed

917
00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:50.087
as you need it

918
00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:51.007
to be. So as

919
00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:52.286
we cycle through this,

920
00:18:52.445 --> 00:18:52.865
You know, you can

921
00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:53.445
see here we still

922
00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:54.565
have our numbered list,

923
00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:55.763
but underneath this we're

924
00:18:55.763 --> 00:18:57.243
adding additional details, right?

925
00:18:57.423 --> 00:18:57.903
We even have a

926
00:18:57.903 --> 00:18:59.103
list with a list

927
00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:00.682
underneath. Okay. And so
