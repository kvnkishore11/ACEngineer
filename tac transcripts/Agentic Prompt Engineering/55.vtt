1349
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:30.790
they complete this work

1350
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.230
top to bottom? If

1351
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.549
that's true, you've probably

1352
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:34.329
written a high quality

1353
00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:35.388
prompt. And imagine you

1354
00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:36.788
hand them 10 additional

1355
00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:38.688
prompts. don't change the

1356
00:27:38.688 --> 00:27:39.967
prompt format every single

1357
00:27:39.967 --> 00:27:40.926
time. This is why

1358
00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:42.046
this consistency is so

1359
00:27:42.046 --> 00:27:43.384
important. All right. So

1360
00:27:43.605 --> 00:27:43.984
if you open up

1361
00:27:43.984 --> 00:27:45.144
variables here in our

1362
00:27:45.144 --> 00:27:46.104
parallel sub agents, you

1363
00:27:46.104 --> 00:27:46.884
can see we have

1364
00:27:46.903 --> 00:27:48.903
two positional dynamic variables,

1365
00:27:48.903 --> 00:27:50.301
prompt request and count.

1366
00:27:50.362 --> 00:27:51.201
Right. And you can

1367
00:27:51.201 --> 00:27:52.361
quickly understand this prompt

1368
00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:53.421
by reading the purpose,

1369
00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:54.819
right. File workflow, launch

1370
00:27:54.819 --> 00:27:56.079
count in parallel to

1371
00:27:56.079 --> 00:27:57.419
accomplish tasks detailed in

1372
00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:58.478
prompt requests. All right.

1373
00:27:58.478 --> 00:27:59.097
And then in the

1374
00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:01.500
workflow, step-by-step play nested
