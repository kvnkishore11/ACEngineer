1519
00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.836
that response flowing back

1520
00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:01.556
in here. We can

1521
00:31:01.556 --> 00:31:02.695
kick up another agent

1522
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:03.694
here and let's go

1523
00:31:03.694 --> 00:31:04.815
ahead and run our

1524
00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:06.474
load AI docs. Let's

1525
00:31:06.474 --> 00:31:06.894
go ahead and open

1526
00:31:06.894 --> 00:31:07.733
that up, load AI

1527
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:09.213
docs. So once again,

1528
00:31:09.377 --> 00:31:10.376
with great agentic prompt

1529
00:31:10.376 --> 00:31:11.215
engineering, we're just gonna

1530
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:12.993
collapse everything, understand things

1531
00:31:12.993 --> 00:31:13.432
one step at a

1532
00:31:13.432 --> 00:31:15.071
time, right? Metadata, title,

1533
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:17.489
purpose, input, workflow, output,

1534
00:31:17.568 --> 00:31:19.267
okay? Every single time,

1535
00:31:19.267 --> 00:31:22.304
consistency beats complexity, consistency

1536
00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:24.102
makes you faster. Okay,

1537
00:31:24.102 --> 00:31:24.821
it makes your team

1538
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.740
faster and it makes

1539
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.559
your agents faster when

1540
00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:28.779
you find the working

1541
00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:30.278
formula. And guess what?
