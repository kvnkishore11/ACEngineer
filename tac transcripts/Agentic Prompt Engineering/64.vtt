1568
00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:00.183
information dense keyword that

1569
00:32:00.183 --> 00:32:01.203
we can reference throughout

1570
00:32:01.203 --> 00:32:02.222
our prompts. We have

1571
00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:02.903
a loop and we're

1572
00:32:02.903 --> 00:32:04.422
actually having our agent

1573
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:06.221
call a sub agent

1574
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.641
directly. And so you

1575
00:32:07.641 --> 00:32:08.579
can see this, we

1576
00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:09.980
have five doc scraper

1577
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.058
agents scraping the documentation

1578
00:32:12.058 --> 00:32:12.698
and writing it to

1579
00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:13.238
a new file. We

1580
00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:14.377
should see some of

1581
00:32:14.377 --> 00:32:15.537
these come in here

1582
00:32:15.537 --> 00:32:16.557
by now. Yep, there's

1583
00:32:16.557 --> 00:32:17.935
our documentation coming in.

1584
00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:18.516
inside of our AI

1585
00:32:18.516 --> 00:32:19.295
docs. All right. So

1586
00:32:19.295 --> 00:32:19.954
our agents are bringing

1587
00:32:19.954 --> 00:32:20.575
those in one by

1588
00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:22.273
one. We are delegating.

1589
00:32:22.354 --> 00:32:23.773
We're offloading. Of course,

1590
00:32:23.773 --> 00:32:24.453
once again, this is

1591
00:32:24.453 --> 00:32:25.252
the D and the

1592
00:32:25.252 --> 00:32:26.232
R and D framework

1593
00:32:26.232 --> 00:32:27.832
of great elite context

1594
00:32:27.832 --> 00:32:28.951
engineering. So this is

1595
00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:29.692
ultra powerful. And then

1596
00:32:29.692 --> 00:32:31.310
we have a simple
