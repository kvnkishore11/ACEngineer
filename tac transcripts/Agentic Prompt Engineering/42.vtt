1027
00:20:59.987 --> 00:21:01.865
this new capability. Remember,

1028
00:21:01.984 --> 00:21:03.384
every prompt is about

1029
00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:04.582
the capability that it

1030
00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:05.820
offers you. Every prompt

1031
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.720
format is about the

1032
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.338
capability that it offers

1033
00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:09.157
you and your agent.

1034
00:21:09.157 --> 00:21:10.576
The control flow prompt

1035
00:21:10.596 --> 00:21:11.934
lets us run conditions,

1036
00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:14.412
loops, and early returns.

1037
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:15.011
You can see here

1038
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:15.931
if no path to

1039
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:17.614
plan is provided, immediately

1040
00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:18.732
stop and ask the

1041
00:21:18.732 --> 00:21:19.472
user to provide it.

1042
00:21:19.472 --> 00:21:19.853
So we can, of

1043
00:21:19.853 --> 00:21:21.251
course, very quickly test

1044
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:22.011
this. You can see

1045
00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:23.290
here our prime tier

1046
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.330
list finished. It's got

1047
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.950
a great, great detailed

1048
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.589
layout for us on

1049
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.249
this specific feature. Check
