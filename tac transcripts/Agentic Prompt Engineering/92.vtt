2243
00:45:59.766 --> 00:46:00.585
the pack, all right?

2244
00:46:00.585 --> 00:46:02.344
Because the prompt is

2245
00:46:02.344 --> 00:46:03.445
the new fundamental unit

2246
00:46:03.465 --> 00:46:04.463
of engineering. And with

2247
00:46:04.463 --> 00:46:05.983
the agentic prompt that

2248
00:46:05.983 --> 00:46:07.242
scales much further and

2249
00:46:07.242 --> 00:46:08.262
much farther. And you

2250
00:46:08.262 --> 00:46:09.001
know, to be clear

2251
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:10.320
here, you should be

2252
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.880
writing tons and tons

2253
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.978
of prompts. You want

2254
00:46:12.998 --> 00:46:14.398
to be reusing, encoding,

2255
00:46:14.398 --> 00:46:14.878
you want to be

2256
00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:16.876
templating your engineering into

2257
00:46:16.876 --> 00:46:18.135
your codebase in

2258
00:46:18.135 --> 00:46:19.855
this new outer layer

2259
00:46:19.855 --> 00:46:21.054
that we discuss at

2260
00:46:21.054 --> 00:46:22.472
length intact. That's what

2261
00:46:22.472 --> 00:46:23.311
this is all about.

2262
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:24.152
These are the seven

2263
00:46:24.152 --> 00:46:25.971
levels. Let's talk about

2264
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:27.974
system prompts, versus user

2265
00:46:27.974 --> 00:46:29.592
prompts. So the big

2266
00:46:29.612 --> 00:46:30.851
idea here with a
