31
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.030
engineers haven't yet made.

32
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.390
The winners here are

33
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.750
building libraries of reusable

34
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.510
battle-tested agentic prompts with

35
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.590
composable sections that work

36
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.950
like lego blocks. You

37
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.730
can swap these in

38
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.010
and swap them out

39
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.930
when and if you

40
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.469
need them to scale

41
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.453
your engineering impact with

42
00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:17.912
compute. You saw this

43
00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:20.331
hands-on inside of TAC.

44
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.490
Every prompt we built

45
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.350
had a similar structure,

46
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:25.049
some with certain sections,

47
00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.429
some without them. By

48
00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.147
writing these prompts consistently,

49
00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:29.007
we were able to

50
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:30.966
communicate with ourselves, with
