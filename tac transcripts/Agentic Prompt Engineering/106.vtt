2576
00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:00.298
so on and so

2577
00:53:00.298 --> 00:53:01.217
forth. All right, we'll

2578
00:53:01.217 --> 00:53:02.057
talk about that more

2579
00:53:02.057 --> 00:53:03.016
in that lesson, but

2580
00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:03.936
I do wanna highlight

2581
00:53:03.936 --> 00:53:04.976
prompts since we are

2582
00:53:04.976 --> 00:53:07.315
talking about agentic prompt

2583
00:53:07.315 --> 00:53:08.713
engineering. The system prompt

2584
00:53:08.713 --> 00:53:09.713
is a key part

2585
00:53:09.713 --> 00:53:10.833
of that story, but

2586
00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:12.391
really 90% of the

2587
00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:13.911
time for most engineers,

2588
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:15.250
all we need is

2589
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.268
one of the seven

2590
00:53:16.268 --> 00:53:17.807
levels of agentic prompt

2591
00:53:17.847 --> 00:53:18.768
formats. And then we

2592
00:53:18.768 --> 00:53:19.286
need to learn how

2593
00:53:19.286 --> 00:53:20.867
to interchange the right

2594
00:53:20.867 --> 00:53:22.650
section write the kind

2595
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.228
of swappable sections, the

2596
00:53:24.228 --> 00:53:26.447
swappable Lego blocks throughout

2597
00:53:26.467 --> 00:53:27.186
the prompt that you're

2598
00:53:27.206 --> 00:53:28.266
writing with the most

2599
00:53:28.266 --> 00:53:29.744
important section by far.

2600
00:53:29.885 --> 00:53:31.083
You know, I'm highlighting
