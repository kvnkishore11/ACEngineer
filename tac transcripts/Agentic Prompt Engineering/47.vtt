1152
00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:30.073
image output directory, we

1153
00:23:30.073 --> 00:23:30.872
can quickly just see

1154
00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.211
where this is referenced

1155
00:23:32.271 --> 00:23:33.290
and we can see,

1156
00:23:33.431 --> 00:23:34.151
you know, the model

1157
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:34.770
we're using, we can

1158
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.710
quickly just update the

1159
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.529
model that we're using

1160
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:37.808
to generate the image.

1161
00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:38.209
And of course we

1162
00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:38.969
can update the aspect

1163
00:23:38.969 --> 00:23:39.708
ratio, so on and

1164
00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:40.307
so forth, right? All

1165
00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:41.167
this stuff. We can

1166
00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:43.227
add arbitrary static and

1167
00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:44.326
dynamic variables here, right?

1168
00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:45.685
But the interesting thing

1169
00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:46.785
here is in the

1170
00:23:46.785 --> 00:23:48.663
workflow, in these control

1171
00:23:48.663 --> 00:23:50.064
flow prompts, you can

1172
00:23:50.064 --> 00:23:51.522
of course, with natural

1173
00:23:51.542 --> 00:23:53.961
language, request loops. Okay,

1174
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.861
so we're saying important,

1175
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.141
then generate number of

1176
00:23:56.141 --> 00:23:57.299
images, right? We're referencing

1177
00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:58.660
a variable using the

1178
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.159
image generation prompt following
