1129
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.589
Right. So of course

1130
00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:01.108
this would look like

1131
00:23:01.128 --> 00:23:02.887
this slash create image.

1132
00:23:02.907 --> 00:23:03.428
And you can see

1133
00:23:03.428 --> 00:23:04.707
here we would pass

1134
00:23:04.707 --> 00:23:05.527
in something like some

1135
00:23:05.527 --> 00:23:07.205
file with image prompts

1136
00:23:07.266 --> 00:23:08.005
and then we pass

1137
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:08.944
in a number positional

1138
00:23:08.944 --> 00:23:10.263
arguments. You know exactly

1139
00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.063
how that works. We

1140
00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:13.342
have three additional static

1141
00:23:13.362 --> 00:23:14.641
variables. Okay. So very

1142
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:15.701
powerful stuff here. We're

1143
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:16.700
starting to use more

1144
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.159
static variables that we

1145
00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:20.218
can reference throughout our

1146
00:23:20.218 --> 00:23:21.317
prompt. Right. This is

1147
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.296
very useful for agents

1148
00:23:23.296 --> 00:23:24.695
and to communicate value

1149
00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:26.134
to yourself right in

1150
00:23:26.134 --> 00:23:27.513
the future and to

1151
00:23:27.513 --> 00:23:28.413
your team, right? So

1152
00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:30.073
image output directory, we
