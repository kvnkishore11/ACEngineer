233
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.790
bun dev. So there's

234
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.911
more detail here, but

235
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:32.670
this is still a

236
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.516
simple, high level prompt

237
00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:35.596
with the one addition

238
00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:36.735
of the purpose. We

239
00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:37.875
have one line where

240
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.053
we're saying, hey, this

241
00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:39.874
is exactly what you're

242
00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:40.892
meant to do. Notice

243
00:05:40.892 --> 00:05:41.632
the tone of voice

244
00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:42.891
here. We're speaking to

245
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:44.490
our agent, right? Start

246
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.430
the agentic prompt tier

247
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.728
list application for development.

248
00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:47.487
This is the purpose

249
00:05:47.487 --> 00:05:48.548
of this agent when

250
00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:49.427
we run this. Okay.

251
00:05:49.427 --> 00:05:50.706
And so purpose is

252
00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:52.305
powerful and it's simple

253
00:05:52.305 --> 00:05:53.264
to use. This is

254
00:05:53.264 --> 00:05:53.824
going to be B

255
00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:55.362
tier useful and it's

256
00:05:55.362 --> 00:05:56.362
going to be D

257
00:05:56.362 --> 00:05:57.994
tier skill requirement right

258
00:05:57.994 --> 00:05:59.274
it's quite simple to

259
00:05:59.274 --> 00:06:00.492
write a purpose just
