2079
00:42:29.846 --> 00:42:30.766
for a second and

2080
00:42:30.766 --> 00:42:32.085
collapse. We have this

2081
00:42:32.184 --> 00:42:33.963
expertise section, right? And

2082
00:42:33.963 --> 00:42:34.923
this section is powerful.

2083
00:42:35.164 --> 00:42:35.664
We're not going to

2084
00:42:35.664 --> 00:42:36.682
dive into exactly what

2085
00:42:36.682 --> 00:42:37.862
this does, but it

2086
00:42:37.862 --> 00:42:39.461
gives this agent, it

2087
00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:42.061
gives this expert specific

2088
00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:43.360
details that we're going

2089
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.559
to have another agent

2090
00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:45.878
or this agent itself

2091
00:42:45.918 --> 00:42:46.777
update. So we went

2092
00:42:46.777 --> 00:42:48.057
from meta prompts where

2093
00:42:48.057 --> 00:42:49.416
we have agents generating

2094
00:42:49.516 --> 00:42:51.835
fresh brand new prompts,

2095
00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:52.876
right? easier to create

2096
00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:53.355
than it is to

2097
00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:54.635
update to level seven.

2098
00:42:55.034 --> 00:42:56.333
Where effectively we're having

2099
00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:57.833
our agents update our

2100
00:42:57.853 --> 00:42:59.612
agents. How? By having

2101
00:42:59.612 --> 00:43:01.291
our prompts update our
