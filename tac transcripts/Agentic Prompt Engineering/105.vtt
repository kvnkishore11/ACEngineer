2555
00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:31.626
sections, all right? Purpose,

2556
00:52:31.626 --> 00:52:34.297
instructions, and examples. This

2557
00:52:34.297 --> 00:52:34.936
is something we're gonna

2558
00:52:34.936 --> 00:52:36.556
look at directly in

2559
00:52:36.556 --> 00:52:38.255
our Claude Code SDK

2560
00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.833
extended lesson. We're going

2561
00:52:39.833 --> 00:52:41.273
to build out specific

2562
00:52:41.273 --> 00:52:42.911
agents with specific system

2563
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:44.331
prompts and really showcase

2564
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:45.891
the impact, the massive

2565
00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:47.130
impact they have over

2566
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.289
your user prompts. But

2567
00:52:48.329 --> 00:52:49.748
the ideas are quite

2568
00:52:49.748 --> 00:52:50.987
similar, right? You set

2569
00:52:50.987 --> 00:52:51.847
up a purpose, you

2570
00:52:51.847 --> 00:52:52.927
give them a large

2571
00:52:52.927 --> 00:52:54.365
set of instructions, and

2572
00:52:54.365 --> 00:52:56.041
then you specify some

2573
00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:57.260
examples of how to

2574
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.440
do things, of how

2575
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.539
to use certain tools,

2576
00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:00.298
so on and so
