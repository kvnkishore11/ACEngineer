2385
00:48:59.239 --> 00:49:00.179
you know, some bad

2386
00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:01.117
user prompts, right? You

2387
00:49:01.117 --> 00:49:01.797
just type in some

2388
00:49:01.797 --> 00:49:03.614
garbage, our agent says,

2389
00:49:03.713 --> 00:49:04.193
I have no idea

2390
00:49:04.193 --> 00:49:04.813
what you're talking about,

2391
00:49:04.813 --> 00:49:05.253
but I'm going to

2392
00:49:05.253 --> 00:49:06.313
guess, you know, that's

2393
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:07.172
fine. You can just

2394
00:49:07.172 --> 00:49:08.391
iterate to success, but

2395
00:49:08.391 --> 00:49:08.911
we want to move

2396
00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:09.931
away from that. And

2397
00:49:09.931 --> 00:49:10.610
one way we can

2398
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:11.690
do that is, of

2399
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.349
course, first by writing

2400
00:49:13.429 --> 00:49:15.487
better prompts, then reusing

2401
00:49:15.608 --> 00:49:16.507
your prompts, right, that

2402
00:49:16.507 --> 00:49:17.626
you keep firing off.

2403
00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:18.786
You can create great

2404
00:49:18.867 --> 00:49:20.885
reusable agentic prompts. But

2405
00:49:20.885 --> 00:49:21.766
then when you keep

2406
00:49:21.766 --> 00:49:22.644
moving up the stack,

2407
00:49:22.644 --> 00:49:23.545
right, after you get

2408
00:49:23.565 --> 00:49:24.443
to your ADWs, running

2409
00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:26.523
specific agents, you can

2410
00:49:26.523 --> 00:49:27.623
then build your own

2411
00:49:27.623 --> 00:49:28.501
agent and give it

2412
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:30.780
a specific system prompt.
