2123
00:43:29.797 --> 00:43:32.056
complexity increases and the

2124
00:43:32.056 --> 00:43:34.036
level increases, these prompts

2125
00:43:34.036 --> 00:43:35.315
are also more rare,

2126
00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:37.275
right? It's unlikely that

2127
00:43:37.275 --> 00:43:38.114
you even have a

2128
00:43:38.114 --> 00:43:39.193
use case where you

2129
00:43:39.193 --> 00:43:40.034
could really dig into

2130
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:40.793
this and get value

2131
00:43:40.813 --> 00:43:41.313
out of this. But

2132
00:43:41.313 --> 00:43:41.672
if you do and

2133
00:43:41.672 --> 00:43:42.612
when you do, these

2134
00:43:42.612 --> 00:43:44.731
prompts are absolutely insane.

2135
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:46.710
We're basically updating the

2136
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.911
context inside of our

2137
00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:49.110
prompts in a live

2138
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.331
way. There are many

2139
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:51.771
ways to dig into

2140
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:52.769
this and extend this,

2141
00:43:52.769 --> 00:43:53.809
but this is the

2142
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:54.949
beginning of this, right?

2143
00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:56.960
You have self-updating prompts,

2144
00:43:57.161 --> 00:43:58.440
okay? So very important,

2145
00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.139
let's go ahead and

2146
00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:00.480
place this, self-improving, we're
