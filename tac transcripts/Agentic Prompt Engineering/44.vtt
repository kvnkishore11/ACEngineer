1076
00:21:59.391 --> 00:22:00.351
can imagine this getting

1077
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:01.789
a lot more complex.

1078
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:03.349
The most popular extension

1079
00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:04.209
of this will be

1080
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:06.147
of course conditionals and

1081
00:22:06.147 --> 00:22:07.188
loops. Let's open up

1082
00:22:07.188 --> 00:22:08.467
the create image prompt

1083
00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:09.307
here. We're creating an

1084
00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:09.787
image. We're going to

1085
00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.046
run that exact same

1086
00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:12.964
understanding workflow, right? We

1087
00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:14.384
collapse everything on level

1088
00:22:14.384 --> 00:22:15.183
two and we just

1089
00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:16.243
analyze the prompt top

1090
00:22:16.243 --> 00:22:17.002
to bottom, right? We

1091
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.403
have the metadata section.

1092
00:22:18.502 --> 00:22:19.221
We have the title.

1093
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:20.142
We have a kind

1094
00:22:20.142 --> 00:22:21.601
of a bad tone

1095
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:23.000
of voice purpose, but

1096
00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:23.779
it's fine. This will

1097
00:22:23.779 --> 00:22:24.599
get through. We're saying

1098
00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:26.098
this command generates images.

1099
00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:27.038
Really you want that

1100
00:22:27.038 --> 00:22:28.718
direct tone of voice.

1101
00:22:28.778 --> 00:22:29.377
You'd say something like

1102
00:22:29.377 --> 00:22:30.837
this, generate images based
