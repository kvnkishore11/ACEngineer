2485
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.050
dynamic variables coming in

2486
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.110
to your sub agents

2487
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.349
other than the prompt

2488
00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:03.509
that your primary agent

2489
00:51:03.509 --> 00:51:04.427
passes in. This is

2490
00:51:04.427 --> 00:51:05.487
the system prompt for

2491
00:51:05.487 --> 00:51:06.148
sub agent. And then

2492
00:51:06.148 --> 00:51:07.047
we have a workflow

2493
00:51:07.047 --> 00:51:07.746
for this, all right?

2494
00:51:07.987 --> 00:51:08.905
So the workflow step

2495
00:51:08.925 --> 00:51:11.117
is useful. the report

2496
00:51:11.117 --> 00:51:12.637
and response step can

2497
00:51:12.637 --> 00:51:13.615
be useful, but you

2498
00:51:13.615 --> 00:51:14.295
also don't wanna be

2499
00:51:14.295 --> 00:51:15.954
too prescriptive with those

2500
00:51:15.954 --> 00:51:17.994
steps, okay? Usually, you

2501
00:51:17.994 --> 00:51:18.974
don't wanna be over

2502
00:51:18.974 --> 00:51:20.213
prescriptive with your system

2503
00:51:20.213 --> 00:51:21.811
prompt, okay? So for

2504
00:51:21.811 --> 00:51:22.851
sub-agents, I think having

2505
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:23.971
a workflow is good

2506
00:51:23.971 --> 00:51:24.610
because you want your

2507
00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:25.210
sub-agents to do a

2508
00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.909
specific thing, but for

2509
00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:28.927
entire primary agent system

2510
00:51:28.927 --> 00:51:30.407
prompts, you usually don't
