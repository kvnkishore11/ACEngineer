492
00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:30.381
get to variables, everything

493
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:31.101
else is the same.

494
00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:32.312
right? We have the

495
00:10:32.312 --> 00:10:33.072
title, we have the

496
00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:34.532
purpose. In our purpose

497
00:10:34.532 --> 00:10:34.912
here, we're being a

498
00:10:34.912 --> 00:10:36.272
bit more prescriptive about

499
00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:37.311
what to do exactly.

500
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:37.811
And then we have

501
00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:38.889
our workflow and our

502
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:40.690
report section. Variables is

503
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.808
very, very important, right?

504
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.489
This is where your

505
00:10:42.489 --> 00:10:44.488
prompts become massively more

506
00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:45.547
valuable. A lot of

507
00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:46.466
the work we do

508
00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.086
is repeat work that

509
00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:50.004
runs in step sequences

510
00:10:50.004 --> 00:10:51.044
of steps, right? This

511
00:10:51.044 --> 00:10:52.264
is what the agentic

512
00:10:52.264 --> 00:10:53.903
workflows right now are

513
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:54.982
solving for us. And

514
00:10:55.202 --> 00:10:56.522
you can throw agentic

515
00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.341
workflows right into one

516
00:10:58.341 --> 00:10:59.701
of these workflow prompts,

517
00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:00.561
right? You can also
