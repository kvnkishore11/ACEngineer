1470
00:29:58.955 --> 00:30:00.674
expectations, okay? We're really

1471
00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:01.454
kind of building out

1472
00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:03.252
that input workflow output

1473
00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:05.092
three-step structure for our

1474
00:30:05.092 --> 00:30:06.310
primary agent to pass

1475
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.030
into all of our

1476
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.490
sub-agents. This prompt is

1477
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.709
very powerful. We're spinning

1478
00:30:09.709 --> 00:30:10.887
up more compute that

1479
00:30:10.887 --> 00:30:12.426
in itself can build

1480
00:30:12.426 --> 00:30:13.446
out, you know, entire

1481
00:30:13.446 --> 00:30:15.477
prompts and agents. So

1482
00:30:15.477 --> 00:30:15.957
this is a very

1483
00:30:15.957 --> 00:30:17.435
powerful concept. This is

1484
00:30:17.435 --> 00:30:19.174
the future of engineering.

1485
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:19.874
Once you build up

1486
00:30:19.894 --> 00:30:21.233
great agents that perform

1487
00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:21.752
for you and get

1488
00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:23.112
work done, the next

1489
00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:24.412
question is how many

1490
00:30:24.412 --> 00:30:25.191
agents can you spin

1491
00:30:25.191 --> 00:30:25.990
up? How much work

1492
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.809
can you do? How

1493
00:30:26.809 --> 00:30:27.549
much compute can you

1494
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:28.888
use? Right? And of

1495
00:30:28.888 --> 00:30:30.107
course, that's what TAC
