2643
00:54:29.206 --> 00:54:30.226
about your agents. It's

2644
00:54:30.226 --> 00:54:31.806
not just about you.

2645
00:54:32.034 --> 00:54:32.793
It's not just about

2646
00:54:32.793 --> 00:54:33.873
your team. You need

2647
00:54:33.873 --> 00:54:35.353
to hit the trifecta,

2648
00:54:35.353 --> 00:54:37.192
all right? The stakeholder

2649
00:54:37.192 --> 00:54:39.010
trifecta for the age

2650
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.990
of agents. There's a

2651
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:41.190
new user, there's a

2652
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.389
new profile, there's a

2653
00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:44.248
new type of consumer

2654
00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:44.889
of the work that

2655
00:54:44.889 --> 00:54:45.907
you're doing. It's your

2656
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:46.728
agent. So we need

2657
00:54:46.728 --> 00:54:47.648
to be thinking about

2658
00:54:47.648 --> 00:54:49.246
this trifecta as we're

2659
00:54:49.246 --> 00:54:51.005
writing great agentic prompts.

2660
00:54:51.045 --> 00:54:52.664
Consistency is king when

2661
00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:53.625
it comes to writing

2662
00:54:53.704 --> 00:54:55.443
great agentic prompts. You

2663
00:54:55.443 --> 00:54:56.384
know, there are other

2664
00:54:56.384 --> 00:54:57.583
sections that we didn't

2665
00:54:57.583 --> 00:54:58.922
work through. There are

2666
00:54:59.143 --> 00:55:00.922
other ways to express
