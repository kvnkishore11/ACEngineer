2005
00:40:58.963 --> 00:41:00.402
prompt has many of

2006
00:41:00.402 --> 00:41:01.862
the formats we've discussed,

2007
00:41:01.922 --> 00:41:03.440
right? Including this code

2008
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.139
base structure, right? Because

2009
00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:05.958
we want to let

2010
00:41:05.958 --> 00:41:07.358
our agent know exactly

2011
00:41:07.489 --> 00:41:08.570
what things are, where

2012
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.449
they should go, right?

2013
00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:10.349
What the structure looks

2014
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:11.268
like. This prompt would

2015
00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:12.688
absolutely run without the

2016
00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:14.047
section, but it can

2017
00:41:14.047 --> 00:41:15.146
help in small ways

2018
00:41:15.146 --> 00:41:16.166
by speeding things up.

2019
00:41:16.166 --> 00:41:16.585
You can see we

2020
00:41:16.585 --> 00:41:18.264
have that template section,

2021
00:41:18.324 --> 00:41:19.945
right? The plan format,

2022
00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:21.664
we're detailing exactly how

2023
00:41:21.664 --> 00:41:22.324
we want the plan

2024
00:41:22.324 --> 00:41:23.103
to look like. And

2025
00:41:23.103 --> 00:41:23.943
then of course at

2026
00:41:23.943 --> 00:41:24.902
the bottom, we have

2027
00:41:24.902 --> 00:41:25.802
a report and we're

2028
00:41:25.802 --> 00:41:26.762
just saying, give me

2029
00:41:26.762 --> 00:41:28.181
just the path to

2030
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:29.061
the plan you just

2031
00:41:29.061 --> 00:41:30.360
created. A very powerful
