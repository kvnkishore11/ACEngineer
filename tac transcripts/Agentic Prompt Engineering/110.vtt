00:54:59.143 --> 00:55:00.922
other ways to express

2667
00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:02.521
these sections, that's not

2668
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:03.641
what's important here, okay?

2669
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.860
The key idea here

2670
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.400
is that you have

2671
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.320
swappable Lego blocks that

2672
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.980
are the sections of

2673
00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.458
your agentic prompts that

2674
00:55:10.458 --> 00:55:12.699
each have distinct uses

2675
00:55:12.699 --> 00:55:14.018
and capabilities that you

2676
00:55:14.018 --> 00:55:15.998
can use for repeat

2677
00:55:16.097 --> 00:55:17.996
success in your agentic

2678
00:55:18.076 --> 00:55:19.954
engineering, okay? The prompt

2679
00:55:19.994 --> 00:55:21.512
is the fundamental unit

2680
00:55:21.512 --> 00:55:22.750
of engineering. Invest in

2681
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.188
your prompts for the

2682
00:55:24.188 --> 00:55:26.405
trifecta to achieve asymmetric

2683
00:55:26.405 --> 00:55:27.903
engineering in the age

2684
00:55:28.023 --> 00:55:29.862
of agents, okay? Context

2685
00:55:29.862 --> 00:55:31.699
engineering is very important,
