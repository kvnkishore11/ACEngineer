2462
00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:30.503
four system prompts in

2463
00:50:30.503 --> 00:50:31.322
this entire codebase.

2464
00:50:31.322 --> 00:50:32.161
We have it right

2465
00:50:32.202 --> 00:50:33.342
here, right? We're only

2466
00:50:33.342 --> 00:50:34.880
modifying the system prompt

2467
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.740
here in this background

2468
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.139
agent delegation prompt. And

2469
00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:38.579
then we have a

2470
00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:39.920
couple of Claude Code

2471
00:50:40.239 --> 00:50:42.918
which these themselves are

2472
00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:44.378
system prompts. So this

2473
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:45.396
is an example of

2474
00:50:45.456 --> 00:50:46.336
a system prompt where

2475
00:50:46.336 --> 00:50:47.335
we're just saying, read

2476
00:50:47.335 --> 00:50:48.315
this and use this

2477
00:50:48.315 --> 00:50:49.175
as your system prompt.

2478
00:50:49.215 --> 00:50:50.175
But typically you'll have

2479
00:50:50.175 --> 00:50:51.094
something like this, right?

2480
00:50:51.094 --> 00:50:52.414
So our doc scraper

2481
00:50:52.414 --> 00:50:53.273
agent that kicked up

2482
00:50:53.293 --> 00:50:55.132
has purpose. It has

2483
00:50:55.132 --> 00:50:57.371
a static output directory.

2484
00:50:57.371 --> 00:50:58.311
Remember there are no

2485
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.050
dynamic variables coming in
