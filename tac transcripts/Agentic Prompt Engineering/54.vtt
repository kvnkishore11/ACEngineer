1326
00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:01.038
ability to work through

1327
00:27:01.058 --> 00:27:02.398
more engineering work and

1328
00:27:02.398 --> 00:27:03.338
to generate value where

1329
00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:03.798
you want to be

1330
00:27:03.798 --> 00:27:04.759
thinking less about the

1331
00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.637
stuff that can be

1332
00:27:05.637 --> 00:27:08.840
solved with consistency. Consistency

1333
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.621
is the greatest weapon

1334
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:12.400
against confusion for both

1335
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.159
you and your agent.

1336
00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:15.199
This is a key

1337
00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:16.617
idea in both our

1338
00:27:16.617 --> 00:27:18.836
extended elite context engineering

1339
00:27:18.957 --> 00:27:20.155
lesson and in this

1340
00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:22.095
lesson. We're clearly communicating.

1341
00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:22.934
We want to reduce

1342
00:27:22.934 --> 00:27:24.233
confusion to the very

1343
00:27:24.233 --> 00:27:25.054
minimum. You want to

1344
00:27:25.094 --> 00:27:25.874
be thinking as you're

1345
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:26.813
writing these prompts, you

1346
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:27.692
want to be thinking,

1347
00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:28.751
if I handed this

1348
00:27:28.751 --> 00:27:29.951
to a coworker, could

1349
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:30.790
they complete this work
