1005
00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.246
great reusable agentic prompts

1006
00:20:30.445 --> 00:20:33.184
consistently, input, workflow, output.

1007
00:20:33.224 --> 00:20:33.765
Let's move on to

1008
00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:34.864
level three of our

1009
00:20:34.864 --> 00:20:39.021
agentic prompt format. At

1010
00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:40.001
the next level, we

1011
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:41.820
continue building off our

1012
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.440
existing sections. Let's open

1013
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.779
up build.md. You know,

1014
00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:45.578
this prompt is going

1015
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.058
to come up over

1016
00:20:46.058 --> 00:20:46.499
and over. It's a

1017
00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:47.857
very powerful, very simple

1018
00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:48.718
prompt, but you can

1019
00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:49.856
see there's something going

1020
00:20:49.856 --> 00:20:50.817
on here on line

1021
00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.695
17. We have flow

1022
00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:54.295
control, okay? So level

1023
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.953
three is the control

1024
00:20:55.953 --> 00:20:57.909
flow So we're building

1025
00:20:57.929 --> 00:20:58.928
up on our workflow

1026
00:20:58.928 --> 00:20:59.967
section and we're adding

1027
00:20:59.987 --> 00:21:01.865
this new capability. Remember,
