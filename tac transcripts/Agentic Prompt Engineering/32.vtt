765
00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:00.154
ultra difficult to use,

766
00:16:00.215 --> 00:16:01.852
but oftentimes you don't

767
00:16:01.852 --> 00:16:03.392
need the instructions. You

768
00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:04.291
can just use a

769
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:05.730
workflow. All right, but

770
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.249
I wanted to call

771
00:16:06.249 --> 00:16:06.908
this out. These are

772
00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:08.807
two distinct patterns. And

773
00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:09.587
especially when we start

774
00:16:09.607 --> 00:16:11.047
talking about system prompts

775
00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:12.466
versus user prompts, you're

776
00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:13.086
going to see that

777
00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:14.225
the instructions are going

778
00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:14.686
to be a lot

779
00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:15.605
more valuable for your

780
00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:16.923
system prompt versus your

781
00:16:16.923 --> 00:16:18.224
workflow. When you're writing

782
00:16:18.224 --> 00:16:20.062
these reusable agentic prompts,

783
00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:20.623
this of course is

784
00:16:20.623 --> 00:16:21.003
going to be a

785
00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:22.282
lot more useful for

786
00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.541
the actual play by

787
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:24.201
play that you want

788
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:25.100
your agent to run

789
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.399
in a repeat fashion.

790
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.279
We have the prime

791
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.339
tier list. Okay. And

792
00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:28.818
I just want to

793
00:16:28.818 --> 00:16:29.458
show this off. We

794
00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:30.457
have one additional section
