2335
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.750
prompt. The system prompt

2336
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.121
is your AI's personality

2337
00:48:03.141 --> 00:48:04.239
and the rule book,

2338
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.798
okay? So I'm not

2339
00:48:05.798 --> 00:48:07.077
actually a huge fan

2340
00:48:07.077 --> 00:48:08.217
of the role play.

2341
00:48:08.398 --> 00:48:09.157
More importantly though, you

2342
00:48:09.157 --> 00:48:09.996
wanna go into more

2343
00:48:09.996 --> 00:48:10.795
detail, right? You wanna

2344
00:48:10.795 --> 00:48:11.456
say what your AI

2345
00:48:11.456 --> 00:48:12.375
should do, what it

2346
00:48:12.375 --> 00:48:13.333
can't do, right? You're

2347
00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:14.293
setting up rules, you're

2348
00:48:14.293 --> 00:48:15.532
setting up the guideline,

2349
00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:16.112
you're setting up the

2350
00:48:16.112 --> 00:48:17.911
universe for your agent

2351
00:48:17.931 --> 00:48:18.871
to operate in. The

2352
00:48:18.871 --> 00:48:20.110
big deal here, right,

2353
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.528
the key difference, let's

2354
00:48:21.528 --> 00:48:21.929
just go to the

2355
00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:22.807
differences, right? The key

2356
00:48:22.807 --> 00:48:23.748
differences is that your

2357
00:48:23.748 --> 00:48:24.586
system prompts us the

2358
00:48:24.586 --> 00:48:26.206
rules for every conversation

2359
00:48:26.338 --> 00:48:27.217
You can't change this

2360
00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:28.615
mid conversation. It needs

2361
00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:30.295
to handle many scenarios.
