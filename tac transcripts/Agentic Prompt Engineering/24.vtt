565
00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:01.202
in contrast to a

566
00:12:01.202 --> 00:12:02.542
static variable. Let's go

567
00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:03.361
ahead and grade this,

568
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:04.640
right? How powerful are

569
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.821
variables? How useful are

570
00:12:05.821 --> 00:12:06.940
they? These of course

571
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.359
are very useful this

572
00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:08.999
is gonna be a

573
00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.517
tier usefulness and we're

574
00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:11.136
gonna put this in

575
00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:12.995
B tier difficulty right

576
00:12:13.034 --> 00:12:14.712
B tier skill requirement

577
00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:16.152
because now we're referencing

578
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.149
variables both static and

579
00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:20.427
dynamic across your prompt

580
00:12:20.587 --> 00:12:21.407
okay and you can

581
00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:21.947
see here this is

582
00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:23.206
just a simple 23

583
00:12:23.206 --> 00:12:24.384
line prompt this is

584
00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:25.104
gonna scale up in

585
00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:26.082
difficulty right let's go

586
00:12:26.082 --> 00:12:26.503
ahead and look at

587
00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:27.734
a bigger prompt Let's

588
00:12:27.734 --> 00:12:28.572
look at quick plan.

589
00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:29.452
So when I'm working

590
00:12:29.452 --> 00:12:30.052
with prompts, I like
