2101
00:42:59.612 --> 00:43:01.291
our prompts update our

2102
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:03.170
prompts. Okay. And so

2103
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.789
the best pattern I've

2104
00:43:04.789 --> 00:43:05.728
found for this is

2105
00:43:05.728 --> 00:43:07.909
with a dynamic expertise

2106
00:43:07.909 --> 00:43:09.228
section. So this prompt

2107
00:43:09.248 --> 00:43:10.646
grows, it becomes more

2108
00:43:10.646 --> 00:43:12.365
proficient, it gets updated

2109
00:43:12.445 --> 00:43:14.045
on a specific area

2110
00:43:14.186 --> 00:43:15.025
in your codebase

2111
00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.425
in a specific way

2112
00:43:16.445 --> 00:43:17.543
and a specific fashion.

2113
00:43:17.563 --> 00:43:18.463
You can see here

2114
00:43:18.463 --> 00:43:20.063
with the hook expert

2115
00:43:20.063 --> 00:43:21.402
planner, you can see

2116
00:43:21.402 --> 00:43:22.342
exactly what this does,

2117
00:43:22.342 --> 00:43:23.360
right? The trick here

2118
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.440
is in how do

2119
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.119
you update this expertise

2120
00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:27.398
properly, all right? So

2121
00:43:27.398 --> 00:43:28.259
this is a very

2122
00:43:28.259 --> 00:43:29.797
advanced pattern. As the

2123
00:43:29.797 --> 00:43:32.056
complexity increases and the
