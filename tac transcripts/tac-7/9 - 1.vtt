190
00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.456
create random data based

191
00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:31.636
on the existing schema

192
00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:32.555
in our table. So

193
00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:33.014
I wanna be able

194
00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:33.834
to click on a

195
00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.213
table and have it

196
00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:36.514
generate some additional random

197
00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:37.132
data for us to

198
00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:38.033
work with, all right?

199
00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:39.132
So this is another

200
00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:40.312
feature that you might

201
00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:41.252
get requested from your

202
00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.430
PM or something you

203
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.951
wanna build into your

204
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:43.670
product. And now you

205
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.310
can have your agents

206
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.889
do this and multiple

207
00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.509
other features at scale

208
00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:48.567
in parallel. We have

209
00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.086
a more mid-level prompt

210
00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:50.726
here. You can see

211
00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:51.406
there's a lot more

212
00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:52.185
detail. Feel free to

213
00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:53.485
pause and understand what's

214
00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:54.165
going on, but it's

215
00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:55.084
as you would expect,

216
00:04:55.084 --> 00:04:56.264
right? We want synthetic

217
00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:57.584
data based on the

218
00:04:57.584 --> 00:04:59.502
existing table patterns and

219
00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:00.923
schemas. We want support
