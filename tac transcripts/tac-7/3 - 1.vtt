56
00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:30.525
third level of agentic

57
00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:32.057
coding on the agentic

58
00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:34.215
engineering velocity scale. There

59
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.174
are three levels in

60
00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:37.433
loop out loop and

61
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.171
one additional level that

62
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:39.751
we're going to break

63
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:40.870
down in this lesson.

64
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.549
Most engineers are operating

65
00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.528
in the loop throughout

66
00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.528
tack. You've learned how

67
00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:46.087
to construct powerful out

68
00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.387
loop systems that you're

69
00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:48.365
going to see in

70
00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.265
this lesson that clearly

71
00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:51.644
outperform out of the

72
00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.362
box agentic coding tools

73
00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:55.221
because they contain your

74
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.260
engineering practices and your

75
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.900
engineering workflows. But there's

76
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.578
a level beyond Outloop
