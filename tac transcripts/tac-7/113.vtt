2746
00:56:28.416 --> 00:56:31.034
workflows in dangerous mode,

2747
00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:31.795
where we ship all

2748
00:56:31.795 --> 00:56:33.273
the way to production.

2749
00:56:33.273 --> 00:56:33.914
We're gonna showcase exactly

2750
00:56:33.914 --> 00:56:34.672
what that looks like

2751
00:56:34.672 --> 00:56:36.213
and how and when

2752
00:56:36.213 --> 00:56:36.753
we would use this,

2753
00:56:36.753 --> 00:56:37.771
because if you're on

2754
00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:38.192
the edge of this

2755
00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:38.791
stuff, I think you

2756
00:56:38.791 --> 00:56:39.811
can start to see

2757
00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:40.471
how and when we

2758
00:56:40.471 --> 00:56:41.389
could use this, not

2759
00:56:41.389 --> 00:56:42.809
for big features, right?

2760
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.768
Not for serious work

2761
00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:44.748
like that, but for

2762
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:45.768
maybe some bugs, maybe

2763
00:56:45.768 --> 00:56:46.867
some chores, we can

2764
00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:48.427
start to run entire

2765
00:56:48.427 --> 00:56:49.565
workflows in yellow mode

2766
00:56:49.565 --> 00:56:50.505
but i'll see you

2767
00:56:50.666 --> 00:56:52.364
in lesson seven where

2768
00:56:52.364 --> 00:56:53.144
we dive in to

2769
00:56:53.144 --> 00:56:54.903
the secret of Tactical

2770
00:56:54.923 --> 00:56:56.443
Agentic Coding the secret

2771
00:56:56.443 --> 00:56:57.882
of Agentic Coding great

2772
00:56:57.882 --> 00:56:59.181
work here do not

2773
00:56:59.181 --> 00:57:00.360
wait to start putting
