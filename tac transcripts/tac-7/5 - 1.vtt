96
00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.286
prompt and while our

97
00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:31.686
agents cook, let's review

98
00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:32.884
the codebase and

99
00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:34.104
then review their work.

100
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:34.764
As we work through

101
00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:36.643
these, we'll address shortcomings,

102
00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.402
trade-offs and improvements we

103
00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:39.262
can make to this

104
00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:40.980
version of this Outloop

105
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.260
system. And we'll discuss

106
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.139
how you can move

107
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.159
toward the next scale

108
00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.359
of Agentic coding. We

109
00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.798
are approaching the edge.

110
00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:48.837
These are the advanced

111
00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:50.637
lessons to the ideas

112
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.656
here haven't arrived yet.

113
00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:53.135
but I wanna give

114
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:54.276
you the greatest edge

115
00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.694
I possibly can. So

116
00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:56.854
let's get started and

117
00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:57.854
hand off more work

118
00:02:57.854 --> 00:02:58.854
than ever with the

119
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.133
new agentic layer of
