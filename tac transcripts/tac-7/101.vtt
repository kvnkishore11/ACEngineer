WEBVTT

2555
00:50:28.856 --> 00:50:31.215
you organize AI developer

2556
00:50:31.235 --> 00:50:33.094
workflows, ADWs. You'll want

2557
00:50:33.114 --> 00:50:34.173
to resist this and

2558
00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:35.313
you'll doubt that Outloop

2559
00:50:35.373 --> 00:50:36.572
and ZTE are the

2560
00:50:36.572 --> 00:50:37.672
future of engineering, but

2561
00:50:37.672 --> 00:50:39.012
this is the crux

2562
00:50:39.112 --> 00:50:40.731
of tactical agent decoding.

2563
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.771
This is the real

2564
00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:42.769
challenge I have for

2565
00:50:42.769 --> 00:50:43.730
you in this course.

2566
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:44.548
It's not about the

2567
00:50:44.548 --> 00:50:45.789
code. The ideas are

2568
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:47.007
powerful, but the most

2569
00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:48.007
important thing is that

2570
00:50:48.007 --> 00:50:49.188
you must update your

2571
00:50:49.188 --> 00:50:50.367
beliefs. This is a

2572
00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:51.945
belief change that you

2573
00:50:51.945 --> 00:50:53.405
must make for 10

2574
00:50:53.505 --> 00:50:55.965
to 100x scaled engineering

2575
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:57.184
with agents. And once

2576
00:50:57.184 --> 00:50:57.664
you do this for

2577
00:50:57.664 --> 00:50:59.083
yourself, something incredible will

2578
00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:00.362
happen. Once you truly
