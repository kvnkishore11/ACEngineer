00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:00.472
As you close the

2675
00:53:00.472 --> 00:53:01.751
loop on this course,

2676
00:53:01.751 --> 00:53:02.331
as you close the

2677
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:03.510
loop on tactical agentic

2678
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.431
coding, you have to

2679
00:53:04.471 --> 00:53:05.670
answer this question. Are

2680
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:06.391
you running away from

2681
00:53:06.391 --> 00:53:07.291
the future? Are you

2682
00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:08.490
standing still? Are you

2683
00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:09.391
moving toward it? Or

2684
00:53:09.391 --> 00:53:10.050
are you gonna join

2685
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.610
me and sprint toward

2686
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.871
the future with these

2687
00:53:12.871 --> 00:53:14.989
tactics of agentic coding?

2688
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:16.489
Great work here. Thanks

2689
00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:17.289
for following me through

2690
00:53:17.289 --> 00:53:18.409
this. I hope everything

2691
00:53:18.409 --> 00:53:19.150
makes sense to you.

2692
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.989
I'll see you at

2693
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:21.260
the edge in lesson

2694
00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.630
eight.
