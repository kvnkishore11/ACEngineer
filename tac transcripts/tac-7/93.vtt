2367
00:46:29.873 --> 00:46:30.693
It's something that we

2368
00:46:30.693 --> 00:46:31.931
bet big on, but

2369
00:46:31.931 --> 00:46:32.891
there's no doubt in

2370
00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:33.811
my mind, it is

2371
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:34.851
not the optimal way

2372
00:46:34.851 --> 00:46:36.010
to run software with

2373
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:36.971
agents. This is a

2374
00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:38.590
new paradigm of building

2375
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:40.768
arbitrary AI developer workflows

2376
00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:42.467
that can and will

2377
00:46:42.507 --> 00:46:44.347
outperform the software developer

2378
00:46:44.347 --> 00:46:45.865
lifecycle. It's all about

2379
00:46:45.865 --> 00:46:47.164
the composable pieces that

2380
00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:48.423
you put together. It's

2381
00:46:48.423 --> 00:46:48.983
going to look a

2382
00:46:48.983 --> 00:46:50.422
bit different for every

2383
00:46:50.422 --> 00:46:51.862
single organization and every

2384
00:46:51.862 --> 00:46:53.280
single engineer. And yes,

2385
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.920
likely your AI developer

2386
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.219
workflows, right? Your end-to-end

2387
00:46:56.219 --> 00:46:57.797
system will contain similar

2388
00:46:57.797 --> 00:46:59.237
steps. Right, plan, build,

2389
00:46:59.237 --> 00:47:00.576
test, review, document. But
