00:27:59.105 --> 00:28:00.445
vibe code this stuff.

1420
00:28:00.586 --> 00:28:02.045
Your agent is operating

1421
00:28:02.164 --> 00:28:03.144
as you would. You've

1422
00:28:03.144 --> 00:28:04.523
templated your engineering. You

1423
00:28:04.523 --> 00:28:05.502
stay out the loop.

1424
00:28:05.623 --> 00:28:06.603
You have one agent,

1425
00:28:06.682 --> 00:28:08.041
one prompt, one purpose.

1426
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:09.122
All of these tactics

1427
00:28:09.142 --> 00:28:10.141
stack up to give

1428
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:12.400
you some incredible result

1429
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.259
like this, right? Look

1430
00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:15.859
at screenshot four, our

1431
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:17.298
agent is validating work,

1432
00:28:17.298 --> 00:28:18.699
it's running prompts. This

1433
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:19.838
agent has taken over

1434
00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:21.078
this device, it's taken

1435
00:28:21.219 --> 00:28:22.439
over this engineering work.

1436
00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:23.179
Why is that? It's

1437
00:28:23.199 --> 00:28:25.138
because we invested in

1438
00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:26.338
the agentic layer, okay?

1439
00:28:26.557 --> 00:28:27.857
This is Agentic Engineering.

1440
00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:28.877
We're building the system

1441
00:28:29.117 --> 00:28:30.577
that builds the system,
