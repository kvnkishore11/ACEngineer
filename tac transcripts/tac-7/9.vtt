00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.050
Agentic Coding potholes and

173
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.009
problems the tactic is

174
00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:33.970
one agent one prompt

175
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.076
one purpose This unlocks

176
00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:38.495
massive Agentic Coding capabilities

177
00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:40.214
throughout the new agentic

178
00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:40.994
layer of your code

179
00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:42.552
base. Why is that?

180
00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:44.552
Isn't more specific context

181
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.810
better for your agent,

182
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.850
the more it knows

183
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.930
the better it performs?

184
00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.069
This is not true.

185
00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.007
Massive context windows often

186
00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:52.807
leads to a distracted,

187
00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:54.896
confused, agent. This is

188
00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.317
context pollution. This is

189
00:04:56.317 --> 00:04:58.016
context overloading. This is

190
00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.834
toxic context, wherever you

191
00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:00.473
want to call it.
