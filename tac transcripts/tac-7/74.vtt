1870
00:36:58.438 --> 00:37:00.077
time, okay? We're in

1871
00:37:00.077 --> 00:37:01.056
the age of agents.

1872
00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:02.056
This is phase two.

1873
00:37:02.135 --> 00:37:03.155
So let's act like

1874
00:37:03.155 --> 00:37:04.755
it. Prepare for agentic

1875
00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.534
coding capabilities to go

1876
00:37:06.534 --> 00:37:08.373
parabolic, okay? How do

1877
00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:09.172
we do this? We

1878
00:37:09.172 --> 00:37:10.652
build the agentic layer

1879
00:37:10.652 --> 00:37:11.731
into your codebase.

1880
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:12.550
Here's a really, really

1881
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.289
important question to ask

1882
00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:15.590
yourself. As models continue

1883
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.349
to improve, as tools

1884
00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:18.768
continue to progress and

1885
00:37:18.768 --> 00:37:20.168
become more capable, who

1886
00:37:20.168 --> 00:37:21.086
knows what the next

1887
00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:22.925
cloud code like leap

1888
00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:23.766
is going to be?

1889
00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:25.005
If you don't invest

1890
00:37:25.144 --> 00:37:26.525
into the agentic layer

1891
00:37:26.525 --> 00:37:27.824
of your codebase,

1892
00:37:27.844 --> 00:37:28.802
you know when agents

1893
00:37:28.802 --> 00:37:29.842
can solve your problem

1894
00:37:29.842 --> 00:37:31.141
class that you're working
