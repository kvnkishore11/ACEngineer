2412
00:47:29.318 --> 00:47:31.695
of ADWs is completely

2413
00:47:31.695 --> 00:47:33.016
arbitrary. There is no

2414
00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:33.914
one way to do

2415
00:47:33.914 --> 00:47:35.175
this. The one way

2416
00:47:35.175 --> 00:47:35.773
is the way that

2417
00:47:35.773 --> 00:47:36.773
ships in your code

2418
00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:37.494
base. This is just

2419
00:47:37.494 --> 00:47:38.532
a starting point, right?

2420
00:47:38.572 --> 00:47:39.813
This is a package

2421
00:47:39.813 --> 00:47:40.532
for me to deliver

2422
00:47:40.532 --> 00:47:41.592
a message to you.

2423
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:42.311
It's about how you

2424
00:47:42.391 --> 00:47:43.652
organize your codebase.

2425
00:47:43.891 --> 00:47:45.652
It's about always having

2426
00:47:45.931 --> 00:47:47.731
feedback loops. Okay. We're

2427
00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:48.891
not coding anymore, right?

2428
00:47:48.931 --> 00:47:50.431
We've stopped coding because

2429
00:47:50.431 --> 00:47:51.811
we've templated our engineering

2430
00:47:51.811 --> 00:47:52.731
and our agents can

2431
00:47:52.731 --> 00:47:53.831
ship on our behalf.

2432
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:54.911
When we ship, we

2433
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:56.809
adopt their perspective. And

2434
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:57.730
of course, when you

2435
00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:58.429
put all this together,

2436
00:47:58.429 --> 00:47:59.590
you can stay out

2437
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:00.670
the loop because you
