33
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.636
build, and test autonomously,

34
00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:01.456
your agents will be

35
00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:02.515
able to review their

36
00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:03.994
work to make sure

37
00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:05.375
what they've done is

38
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.034
exactly what you've asked.

39
00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:08.134
If the work doesn't

40
00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.272
align with your plan,

41
00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:10.992
they'll agentically fix the

42
00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:12.332
issue. If it does,

43
00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:12.873
they'll give you a

44
00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.531
concise summary of the

45
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.212
work just like you

46
00:01:16.212 --> 00:01:17.052
or a team member

47
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:19.331
would to concretely communicate

48
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:20.352
what's been done and

49
00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:21.570
how it works. I've

50
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450
distinguished this step in

51
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.251
the software developer lifecycle

52
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.891
for this reason. For

53
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:28.430
Agentic Coding, this is

54
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.930
massively important for increasing
