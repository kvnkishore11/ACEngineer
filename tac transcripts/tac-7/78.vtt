1974
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:00.594
old way go in

1975
00:39:00.594 --> 00:39:01.235
the loop stay in

1976
00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:02.193
the loop fine you

1977
00:39:02.193 --> 00:39:03.434
can stand still let

1978
00:39:03.434 --> 00:39:04.114
the future come to

1979
00:39:04.114 --> 00:39:05.373
you this is faster

1980
00:39:05.373 --> 00:39:06.253
than running away right

1981
00:39:06.253 --> 00:39:07.193
you don't disagree with

1982
00:39:07.193 --> 00:39:07.952
the future but you're

1983
00:39:07.952 --> 00:39:09.072
not doing anything about

1984
00:39:09.072 --> 00:39:10.333
it fine obviously that's

1985
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:11.411
not us right then

1986
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:12.492
you can move toward

1987
00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:13.572
the future as it's

1988
00:39:13.572 --> 00:39:14.351
coming toward you you

1989
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.130
move toward the future

1990
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:16.150
this is powerful this

1991
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.570
is where you want

1992
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.411
to be or you

1993
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:18.411
can take everything we've

1994
00:39:18.411 --> 00:39:19.630
done here and sprint

1995
00:39:19.769 --> 00:39:21.949
sprint toward the future

1996
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.568
of engineering. Beat everyone

1997
00:39:23.568 --> 00:39:24.849
else there. Get this

1998
00:39:24.849 --> 00:39:25.547
agent declare in your

1999
00:39:25.547 --> 00:39:26.588
codebase. Get this

2000
00:39:26.588 --> 00:39:27.646
up and running. Have

2001
00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:28.606
agents building for you.

2002
00:39:28.887 --> 00:39:29.646
Build a system that

2003
00:39:29.646 --> 00:39:30.766
builds a system. This
