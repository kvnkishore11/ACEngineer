2626
00:51:59.293 --> 00:52:01.713
to revisit the atoms

2627
00:52:01.753 --> 00:52:02.952
of agentic coding, the

2628
00:52:02.952 --> 00:52:05.010
new fundamental primitives of

2629
00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:05.851
agentic coding that you

2630
00:52:05.851 --> 00:52:06.750
can use. And then

2631
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:07.550
we're gonna look at

2632
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:08.889
compositions of them. We're

2633
00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:09.768
going to scale up

2634
00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:10.208
and we're going to

2635
00:52:10.208 --> 00:52:10.927
look at different code

2636
00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:11.925
base types with their

2637
00:52:11.925 --> 00:52:13.644
own agentic layers, solving

2638
00:52:13.644 --> 00:52:14.963
their own unique problems

2639
00:52:15.023 --> 00:52:15.963
that you likely have

2640
00:52:15.963 --> 00:52:17.501
encountered in your engineering.

2641
00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:18.280
Okay. I'm going to

2642
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.380
give you many code

2643
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.079
bases you can use

2644
00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:22.237
to explore, understand, and

2645
00:52:22.237 --> 00:52:23.976
quick start your agentic

2646
00:52:23.976 --> 00:52:25.893
coding of your agentic

2647
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:27.246
layer. Okay, you'll see

2648
00:52:27.246 --> 00:52:28.244
how these primitives compose

2649
00:52:28.244 --> 00:52:29.425
differently for web app,

2650
00:52:29.684 --> 00:52:31.324
CLI tools, notebooks. Most
