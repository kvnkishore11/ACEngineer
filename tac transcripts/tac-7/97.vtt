2457
00:48:28.514 --> 00:48:30.329
it has been deployed

2458
00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:31.648
to production, okay? The

2459
00:48:31.648 --> 00:48:32.666
issue is closed. All

2460
00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:33.766
I did was write

2461
00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:34.625
this prompt. Update the

2462
00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:35.822
background color. Of course,

2463
00:48:35.822 --> 00:48:36.561
yes, it's like we've

2464
00:48:36.561 --> 00:48:37.501
talked about. This is

2465
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:38.800
just a starting point.

2466
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:40.717
Agents can push more

2467
00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.735
than this. They can

2468
00:48:41.735 --> 00:48:42.715
do more than this,

2469
00:48:42.735 --> 00:48:43.574
but it's all about

2470
00:48:43.713 --> 00:48:44.632
progression, think in the

2471
00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:46.472
gray and don't reject

2472
00:48:46.652 --> 00:48:47.590
the ideas of the

2473
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.530
future. Target zero touch

2474
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.469
engineering. This is the

2475
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:51.728
tactic of lesson seven.

2476
00:48:51.748 --> 00:48:52.788
This is your North

2477
00:48:52.788 --> 00:48:54.007
Star when you are

2478
00:48:54.007 --> 00:48:55.146
building out the agentic

2479
00:48:55.146 --> 00:48:55.686
layer of your code

2480
00:48:55.686 --> 00:48:56.644
base. In the back

2481
00:48:56.644 --> 00:48:57.384
of your head, you

2482
00:48:57.384 --> 00:48:58.463
wanna think, how can

2483
00:48:58.463 --> 00:48:59.322
I build this so

2484
00:48:59.322 --> 00:48:59.902
that I can gain

2485
00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:01.302
confidence to one day
