1653
00:32:59.817 --> 00:33:00.778
time on one agentic

1654
00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.497
workflow and ship features

1655
00:33:02.497 --> 00:33:03.455
to production, right? That's

1656
00:33:03.455 --> 00:33:04.056
not what I'm saying

1657
00:33:04.056 --> 00:33:05.155
here. Progress happens one

1658
00:33:05.155 --> 00:33:05.714
step at a time,

1659
00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:06.115
one day at a

1660
00:33:06.115 --> 00:33:07.513
time. First, go after

1661
00:33:07.513 --> 00:33:08.634
chores, then go after

1662
00:33:08.634 --> 00:33:09.693
bugs, then go after

1663
00:33:09.693 --> 00:33:11.573
features, right? Scale it

1664
00:33:11.613 --> 00:33:13.251
up, solve these stupid,

1665
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:14.951
simple problems that waste

1666
00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:15.750
your time. You know

1667
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.650
what they are. You've

1668
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.549
already thought of them

1669
00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.429
as you're working throughout

1670
00:33:18.449 --> 00:33:19.249
tech. You've already thought

1671
00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:19.848
of things you want

1672
00:33:19.868 --> 00:33:20.968
to augment and automate,

1673
00:33:21.008 --> 00:33:21.788
then scale scale it

1674
00:33:21.807 --> 00:33:22.528
up one step at

1675
00:33:22.528 --> 00:33:23.646
a time, okay? This

1676
00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:24.846
is ultra important. We'll

1677
00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:25.625
fire one of these

1678
00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:26.465
off in just a

1679
00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:27.506
moment. If I open

1680
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:28.884
up the codebase,

1681
00:33:28.944 --> 00:33:29.525
let's get back to

1682
00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:30.084
main. So I'm gonna
