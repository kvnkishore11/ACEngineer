drastically scaled up when

680
00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:02.346
you put your effort

681
00:14:02.346 --> 00:14:03.985
into your agentic layer,

682
00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:04.764
right? And that top

683
00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:06.104
layer, the top surface

684
00:14:06.104 --> 00:14:06.764
layer of that is

685
00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:07.523
of course your AI

686
00:14:07.523 --> 00:14:08.903
developer workflows. And then

687
00:14:08.903 --> 00:14:09.981
once you work down,

688
00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:11.149
the lower levels you

689
00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:12.129
get to your individual

690
00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.629
prompts and the details

691
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:15.229
of you know your

692
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.328
agentic prompts and how

693
00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:17.629
they work and how

694
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:19.528
things compose back up

695
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.489
to your ai developer

696
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:21.807
workflow level that's super

697
00:14:21.807 --> 00:14:22.788
key really important to

698
00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:23.307
be able to dive

699
00:14:23.307 --> 00:14:24.868
into an environment that's

700
00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:25.607
git work trees that's

701
00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:26.248
how we're using them

702
00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.408
here to parallelize our

703
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.886
workflows it's also important

704
00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:29.606
to mention that the

705
00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:30.687
lesson six tactic has
