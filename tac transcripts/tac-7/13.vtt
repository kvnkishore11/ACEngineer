297
00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.475
issue live with the

298
00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:31.394
events coming in. So

299
00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:32.713
let's continue. Let's scale

300
00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:33.353
up what we can

301
00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:34.533
do, right? We've templated

302
00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:35.992
our engineering. We've digitized

303
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:37.132
our engineering into our

304
00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:38.211
agentic layer. Move to

305
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.569
the next task. We'll

306
00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:40.949
fire this off. And

307
00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:41.668
the same thing will

308
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:42.389
happen here, right? If

309
00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.987
we just wait for

310
00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:43.427
a second, we're going

311
00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:43.887
to get a nice

312
00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:45.187
response. There it is

313
00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:46.406
classified and the work

314
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.524
is beginning. Let's go

315
00:06:47.524 --> 00:06:48.264
ahead, move to our

316
00:06:48.264 --> 00:06:49.723
big feature. You'll notice

317
00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.242
something important here. This

318
00:06:51.242 --> 00:06:52.281
is going to run

319
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.100
SDLC, but we're using

320
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.319
model set heavy. I'll

321
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.800
break this down in

322
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.718
a moment. Let's kick

323
00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:56.399
this off. Let's wait

324
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.197
for our workflow here

325
00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:58.177
to respond. This should

326
00:06:58.177 --> 00:06:58.776
just take a couple

327
00:06:58.776 --> 00:06:59.557
of seconds. There we

328
00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:01.096
go. High level breakdown.
