to conceive of letting

2165
00:42:30.063 --> 00:42:30.702
you go. It'll be

2166
00:42:30.702 --> 00:42:31.942
the opposite, right? They'll

2167
00:42:31.942 --> 00:42:32.882
be scrambling to try

2168
00:42:32.882 --> 00:42:33.840
to keep you around

2169
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.840
and try to spread

2170
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.018
your principles of AI

2171
00:42:36.018 --> 00:42:37.039
coding and spread your

2172
00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:38.838
tactics of Agentic coding

2173
00:42:38.876 --> 00:42:40.056
to your team. Not

2174
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:41.554
only is this extremely

2175
00:42:41.554 --> 00:42:42.494
great, right? Moving up

2176
00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:43.574
the stack, wielding more

2177
00:42:43.574 --> 00:42:45.293
compute in parallel. Not

2178
00:42:45.293 --> 00:42:45.851
only is this great

2179
00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:47.012

2180
00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:48.471
defensibility and, you know,

2181
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:50.027
advancement, but you're going

2182
00:42:50.027 --> 00:42:50.885
to send your engineering

2183
00:42:50.885 --> 00:42:51.704
team to the next

2184
00:42:51.704 --> 00:42:53.141
level and therefore your

2185
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.496
company, right? The tech

2186
00:42:54.496 --> 00:42:56.869
industry, VCs, talking heads,

2187
00:42:56.929 --> 00:42:57.989
they're all wondering where

2188
00:42:57.989 --> 00:42:59.407
the big AI gains

2189
00:42:59.427 --> 00:43:00.307
will come from. They're
