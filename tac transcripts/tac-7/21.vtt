498
00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:30.044
own, but this is

499
00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:31.403
an incredible starting point

500
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:32.423
for the agentic layer

501
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.403
of our codebase.

502
00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:34.243
Now let's just focus

503
00:10:34.243 --> 00:10:35.023
on the key pieces

504
00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:36.261
here. We have several

505
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.341
flags and ideas embedded,

506
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:39.061
but what we want

507
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:40.399
to focus on here

508
00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:41.479
So if I just

509
00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:42.798
search this plus that

510
00:10:42.798 --> 00:10:44.616
Python, let's enable regex.

511
00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:45.437
You can see we're

512
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.475
just kicking off lower

513
00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:48.355
level compositional pieces, right?

514
00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:49.134
This is not new.

515
00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:50.033
We start by planning,

516
00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:51.393
we then build, we

517
00:10:51.393 --> 00:10:52.133
then test. You can

518
00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:53.091
see we're skipping end

519
00:10:53.091 --> 00:10:53.850
to end here just

520
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.910
to save some time.

521
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.629
Then we review our

522
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:57.629
work. And then of

523
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:59.008
course we document the

524
00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:00.307
work done. This is
