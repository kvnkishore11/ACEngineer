445
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.470
to end and that's

446
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.581
fine. The point is

447
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:32.441
that we're leaning toward

448
00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:33.659
the future. We're working

449
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.399
toward that future where

450
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.298
we are operating out

451
00:09:36.298 --> 00:09:37.118
the loop more and

452
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.097
more and more. Okay,

453
00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:38.817
this isn't black and

454
00:09:38.817 --> 00:09:39.697
white. It's not in

455
00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:40.855
loop versus out loop.

456
00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.155
It's in loop moving

457
00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:44.053
toward out loop. Okay,

458
00:09:44.274 --> 00:09:44.793
one day at a

459
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.692
time, improving your workflows,

460
00:09:46.692 --> 00:09:47.951
improving your AI developer

461
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:48.991
workflows down to the

462
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:50.410
prompt level. Okay, you

463
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.769
can imagine what this

464
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:52.477
does. This is the

465
00:09:52.477 --> 00:09:54.197
complete software developer lifecycle,

466
00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:55.196
right? And it runs

467
00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:56.975
in isolation. Plan, build,

468
00:09:56.975 --> 00:09:58.754
test, review, document. We

469
00:09:58.754 --> 00:09:59.673
have this entire workflow

470
00:09:59.673 --> 00:10:00.173
and this is what
