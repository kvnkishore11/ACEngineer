112
00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:00.013
is key for increasing

113
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.551
your review velocity you

114
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.472
may have already run

115
00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:04.390
into the constraints of

116
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.129
Agentic Coding planning and

117
00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.528
reviewing here in TAC

118
00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.468
six we're going to

119
00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.027
improve on the review

120
00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:11.706
constraint you'll see exactly

121
00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:12.447
what that looks like

122
00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:13.445
in a moment these

123
00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:14.870
two final steps can

124
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.669
drastically increase your agent

125
00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:18.127
to coding KPIs. We

126
00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:19.866
want attempts down, streak

127
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.784
up, size up, presence

128
00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.123
down. So after we

129
00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:25.022
know our application works,

130
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:26.282
thanks to our testing

131
00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:27.860
AI developer workflow, we

132
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.680
covered in our previous

133
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.900
lesson, lesson five, and

134
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.058
we know the application
