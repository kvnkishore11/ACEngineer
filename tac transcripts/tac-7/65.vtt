1627
00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:30.555
we only needed two,

1628
00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.134
right? Prompt and review.

1629
00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:33.791
In the future, you'll

1630
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:35.530
realize that you're wasting

1631
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.169
time Reviewing. I know

1632
00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:38.527
you're probably O-faced right

1633
00:32:38.527 --> 00:32:39.365
now or thinking the

1634
00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:41.064
O-face or maybe right

1635
00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:41.922
away you just went,

1636
00:32:42.082 --> 00:32:43.240
Dan, absolutely no way,

1637
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.298
that's crazy. This isn't

1638
00:32:44.298 --> 00:32:45.538
a real production application.

1639
00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:46.576
What you're doing is

1640
00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:47.076
you're operating on a

1641
00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:48.473
toy app, you're pushing

1642
00:32:48.554 --> 00:32:49.511
way too far. This

1643
00:32:49.531 --> 00:32:50.431
is a pie in

1644
00:32:50.431 --> 00:32:51.622
the sky dream. I

1645
00:32:51.622 --> 00:32:52.661
get that. I understand.

1646
00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:53.480
Let's slow it down

1647
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.300
a little bit. Okay.

1648
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.059
You don't start by

1649
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.278
shipping a full feature,

1650
00:32:57.298 --> 00:32:57.959
right? I'm not saying

1651
00:32:57.959 --> 00:32:59.137
go into your production

1652
00:32:59.137 --> 00:32:59.817
application, spend all your

1653
00:32:59.817 --> 00:33:00.778
time on one agentic
