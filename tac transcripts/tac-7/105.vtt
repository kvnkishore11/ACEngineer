00:52:29.684 --> 00:52:31.324
CLI tools, notebooks. Most

2651
00:52:31.324 --> 00:52:32.782
importantly, you'll understand how

2652
00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:34.101
to jumpstart the process

2653
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:35.422
of building your agentic

2654
00:52:35.422 --> 00:52:36.481
layer for your code

2655
00:52:36.481 --> 00:52:37.360
base and your domain

2656
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.480
problem. And finally, we're

2657
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.199
gonna look beyond the

2658
00:52:39.199 --> 00:52:39.980
edge right at the

2659
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:40.778
end of lesson eight.

2660
00:52:40.778 --> 00:52:41.898
Just like in principled

2661
00:52:41.898 --> 00:52:42.938
ad coding, we're gonna

2662
00:52:42.938 --> 00:52:43.518
look at how we

2663
00:52:43.518 --> 00:52:45.137
can best position ourselves

2664
00:52:45.137 --> 00:52:46.677
to win today's engineering

2665
00:52:46.677 --> 00:52:48.615
and tomorrow's engineering. Full

2666
00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:50.335
recap, you've reached zero

2667
00:52:50.335 --> 00:52:51.494
touch engineering. You now

2668
00:52:51.494 --> 00:52:53.253
understand where this all

2669
00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:54.612
goes from in loop

2670
00:52:54.612 --> 00:52:55.293
to out loop to

2671
00:52:55.293 --> 00:52:56.911
zero touch engineering you've

2672
00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:58.211
discovered the secret, you

2673
00:52:58.211 --> 00:52:59.771
have the full picture.

2674
00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:00.472
As you close the
