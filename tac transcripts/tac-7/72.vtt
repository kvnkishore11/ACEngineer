1814
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:00.400
more. And then let's

1815
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.239
talk about the secret

1816
00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:02.278
of tactical, logistic coding.

1817
00:36:02.278 --> 00:36:02.978
What has this all

1818
00:36:02.978 --> 00:36:03.737
been leading up to?

1819
00:36:03.818 --> 00:36:04.418
You can see here,

1820
00:36:04.418 --> 00:36:04.996
we've built up to

1821
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.496
these incredible Outloop systems.

1822
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:08.956
Our codebase is

1823
00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:10.135
running itself and we're

1824
00:36:10.135 --> 00:36:10.914
coming in to make

1825
00:36:10.914 --> 00:36:11.755
sure things look good.

1826
00:36:11.873 --> 00:36:12.893
We're spending our time,

1827
00:36:12.994 --> 00:36:13.893
building the system that

1828
00:36:13.893 --> 00:36:15.052
builds a system. And

1829
00:36:15.052 --> 00:36:15.771
I know a lot

1830
00:36:15.771 --> 00:36:16.831
of engineers, when you

1831
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:17.989
look at the zero

1832
00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:19.409
touch engineering scale of

1833
00:36:19.409 --> 00:36:20.289
agent decoding, you might

1834
00:36:20.289 --> 00:36:20.867
think that this is

1835
00:36:20.867 --> 00:36:22.166
impossible. There's no way

1836
00:36:22.206 --> 00:36:23.346
you're letting agents ship

1837
00:36:23.346 --> 00:36:24.784
to production in your

1838
00:36:24.804 --> 00:36:26.443
real production application, right?

1839
00:36:26.443 --> 00:36:27.762
Yes, I completely agree

1840
00:36:27.762 --> 00:36:28.922
with you. We're operating

1841
00:36:28.922 --> 00:36:29.920
on a simple toy

1842
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.320
application. There's no real
