2531
00:49:59.588 --> 00:50:00.708
and document is just

2532
00:50:00.807 --> 00:50:02.467
one way to compose

2533
00:50:02.507 --> 00:50:04.266
agentic primitives. The software

2534
00:50:04.266 --> 00:50:05.286
developer lifecycle we've been

2535
00:50:05.286 --> 00:50:06.804
using is powerful. It

2536
00:50:06.804 --> 00:50:08.125
works, but it's a

2537
00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:09.503
package for me to

2538
00:50:09.503 --> 00:50:10.583
deliver a message to

2539
00:50:10.583 --> 00:50:11.762
you. The real secret

2540
00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:12.222
is that it's about

2541
00:50:12.222 --> 00:50:13.601
the composable units, the

2542
00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:15.121
agentic primitives, all the

2543
00:50:15.121 --> 00:50:15.601
way down to the

2544
00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:16.581
prompt level, all the

2545
00:50:16.581 --> 00:50:17.541
way down to cloud

2546
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:18.440
code, all the way

2547
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.079
up to how you

2548
00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:20.119
organize your codebase,

2549
00:50:20.199 --> 00:50:21.159
how you add tests,

2550
00:50:21.199 --> 00:50:22.559
documentation, how you add

2551
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:23.557
types, and how you

2552
00:50:23.557 --> 00:50:25.637
build up prompts, specs,

2553
00:50:25.657 --> 00:50:27.617
plans, templates, and at

2554
00:50:27.617 --> 00:50:28.856
the highest level, how

2555
00:50:28.856 --> 00:50:31.215
you organize AI developer
