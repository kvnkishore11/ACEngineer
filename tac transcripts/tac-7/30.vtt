727
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.899
this truly frees your

728
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.899
agent to do one

729
00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:03.899
thing extraordinarily well with

730
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:04.599
all the context it

731
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:05.619
needs and it lets

732
00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:06.999
you jump in and

733
00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:08.518
replay what that agent

734
00:15:08.518 --> 00:15:09.669
has done. Right? So

735
00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:10.470
this is super, super

736
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.849
important. So let's hop

737
00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:12.369
back up to the

738
00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:13.688
top level. Let's see

739
00:15:13.688 --> 00:15:14.927
how our agents are

740
00:15:14.988 --> 00:15:16.467
doing. Our add JSON

741
00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:17.427
export agent, if we

742
00:15:17.427 --> 00:15:18.106
scroll to the bottom

743
00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:18.647
here, it looks like

744
00:15:18.647 --> 00:15:19.486
we're in the review

745
00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:20.567
phase and you can

746
00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:21.567
always just scroll up

747
00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:22.566
and see the current

748
00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:24.926
state object tracking everything

749
00:15:24.926 --> 00:15:25.504
that we need to

750
00:15:25.504 --> 00:15:26.605
see at a, you

751
00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:28.065
know, review level. That's

752
00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:29.744
looking great there. What

753
00:15:29.744 --> 00:15:30.644
about our drag and
