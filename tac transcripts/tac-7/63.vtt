1583
00:31:29.457 --> 00:31:30.557
This is the next

1584
00:31:30.636 --> 00:31:31.615
step. Let me just

1585
00:31:31.615 --> 00:31:32.316
be super clear about

1586
00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:33.174
what this is. This

1587
00:31:33.174 --> 00:31:34.534
is YOLO mode for

1588
00:31:34.534 --> 00:31:36.094
your AI developer workflows.

1589
00:31:36.094 --> 00:31:37.333
This is high confidence

1590
00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.991
mode for agenting engineering.

1591
00:31:39.051 --> 00:31:41.050
It's maximum confidence mode

1592
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.690
for agenting engineering. No

1593
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.367
review, right? Just like

1594
00:31:45.367 --> 00:31:46.428
you've stopped coding, you'll

1595
00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:47.987
stop reviewing. This is

1596
00:31:47.987 --> 00:31:49.885
the lesson seven tactic.

1597
00:31:50.082 --> 00:31:52.362
Target zero touch engineering.

1598
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:53.641
This is the ultimate

1599
00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:55.520
agentic coding Northstar. This

1600
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.800
is what your agentic

1601
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.941
coding KPIs lead you

1602
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:59.400
toward. Attempts at one,

1603
00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:01.539
size constantly scaling up,
