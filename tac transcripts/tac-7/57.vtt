1441
00:28:29.117 --> 00:28:30.577
that builds the system,

1442
00:28:30.577 --> 00:28:32.198
right? This is game

1443
00:28:32.198 --> 00:28:32.998
changing and it all

1444
00:28:32.998 --> 00:28:34.477
starts when you stop

1445
00:28:34.477 --> 00:28:35.656
coding. This is not

1446
00:28:35.656 --> 00:28:36.957
our domain anymore, okay?

1447
00:28:36.957 --> 00:28:38.017
Coding, it's not our

1448
00:28:38.017 --> 00:28:39.217
domain anymore. Agents are

1449
00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.457
better at this than

1450
00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:41.996
us. So leverage the

1451
00:28:41.996 --> 00:28:43.776
agents, okay? We're continuing

1452
00:28:43.776 --> 00:28:44.816
on the trend of

1453
00:28:44.816 --> 00:28:46.435
just scaling our compute

1454
00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:47.455
to the next level

1455
00:28:47.715 --> 00:28:48.175
so that we can

1456
00:28:48.175 --> 00:28:49.734
become commanders of compute.

1457
00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:50.835
I can't stress this

1458
00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:52.174
enough how important it

1459
00:28:52.174 --> 00:28:53.134
is to invest in

1460
00:28:53.134 --> 00:28:54.755
your agentic layer, okay?

1461
00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:55.295
This is what the

1462
00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:56.594
winners are doing. I

1463
00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:59.173
parallelized myself across five

1464
00:28:59.193 --> 00:29:01.133
features, right? We're shipping,
