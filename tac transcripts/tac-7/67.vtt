1682
00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:30.084
main. So I'm gonna

1683
00:33:30.084 --> 00:33:31.683
run slash and loop

1684
00:33:31.864 --> 00:33:32.583
and let's go back

1685
00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:33.403
to main. In the

1686
00:33:33.403 --> 00:33:34.163
beginning, I mentioned we

1687
00:33:34.163 --> 00:33:35.281
have this new workflow,

1688
00:33:35.342 --> 00:33:37.501
ZTE. All ZTE does,

1689
00:33:37.501 --> 00:33:38.040
this will run the

1690
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.460
exact same workflow as

1691
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.460
SDLC and then it

1692
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.599
adds one more thing

1693
00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:43.239
and you know what's

1694
00:33:43.239 --> 00:33:44.398
coming, right? We've hinted

1695
00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:45.397
at this already. It

1696
00:33:45.397 --> 00:33:46.157
is going to run

1697
00:33:46.498 --> 00:33:48.395
ship, approve and merge

1698
00:33:48.435 --> 00:33:50.035
the PR agentically. If

1699
00:33:50.055 --> 00:33:51.433
nothing fails here, if

1700
00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:52.633
your agents get through

1701
00:33:52.692 --> 00:33:54.530
your engineering pipeline and

1702
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:55.431
they've proven to you,

1703
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:56.450
great review with great

1704
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.469
tests, that the feature

1705
00:33:57.469 --> 00:33:58.367
is working and you've

1706
00:33:58.367 --> 00:33:59.287
run this over and

1707
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.207
over and over, the
