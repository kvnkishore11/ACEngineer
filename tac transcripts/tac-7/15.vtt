00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:30.976
right? By our AI

348
00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:32.237
developer workflows. This is

349
00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:33.637
all happening in parallel.

350
00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:35.076
We have encoded our

351
00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.235
engineering, right? We've templated

352
00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:37.716
our engineering into the

353
00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:38.475
agentic layer of our

354
00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:39.776
codebase. So now

355
00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:41.235
it operates for us.

356
00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:42.115
The next best thing

357
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:42.795
we can do, right?

358
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:43.154
There's gonna be a

359
00:07:43.154 --> 00:07:44.475
lot of background, right?

360
00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:45.134
A lot of waiting,

361
00:07:45.134 --> 00:07:45.994
a lot of reviewing.

362
00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:47.093
Let's understand the key

363
00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:48.254
changes that were made

364
00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:49.406
to our natural language

365
00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:50.146
codebase here. And

366
00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:51.266
let's break down the

367
00:07:51.286 --> 00:07:52.464
agentic layer, right? This

368
00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:53.524
is the important piece.

369
00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:54.084
As you can see

370
00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:55.024
here, we're operating on

371
00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:56.384
the simple application, but

372
00:07:56.384 --> 00:07:57.305
that's not what this

373
00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:58.845
is about. These ideas,

374
00:07:58.884 --> 00:07:59.783
everything we've talked about,

375
00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:00.824
every single tactic, it
