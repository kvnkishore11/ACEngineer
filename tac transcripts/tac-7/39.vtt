961
00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:30.105
software developer lifecycle. We

962
00:19:30.105 --> 00:19:31.003
can see it all.

963
00:19:31.023 --> 00:19:32.243
We can understand what

964
00:19:32.263 --> 00:19:33.262
our agent was looking

965
00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:34.343
at when it created

966
00:19:34.343 --> 00:19:35.122
some things. And then

967
00:19:35.122 --> 00:19:36.201
we also have our

968
00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:37.500
spec file, of course,

969
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.601
which details out this

970
00:19:38.601 --> 00:19:40.359
chore, relevant files. New

971
00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.436
files, step-by-step, breakdown, blah,

972
00:19:42.436 --> 00:19:43.175
blah, blah, blah, blah.

973
00:19:43.195 --> 00:19:44.255
We've covered all this.

974
00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:45.413
We know how planning,

975
00:19:45.614 --> 00:19:46.692
building, testing, reviewing, and

976
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.869
documenting works, right? The

977
00:19:48.869 --> 00:19:50.088
great part is, is

978
00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:50.807
that we're seeing it

979
00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:52.445
working all together now.

980
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.269
right? Digitized our engineering,

981
00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:54.929
just like we can

982
00:19:54.929 --> 00:19:55.528
copy and paste a

983
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:56.867
file, we can copy

984
00:19:56.867 --> 00:19:58.146
and paste our engineering

985
00:19:58.207 --> 00:19:59.846
across agents. This is

986
00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:00.645
the power of the
