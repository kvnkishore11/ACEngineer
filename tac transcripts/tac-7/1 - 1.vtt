13
00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.407
engineers dismiss as impossible,

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.667
a codebase that

15
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.829
nearly runs itself. This

16
00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.668
lesson is going to

17
00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.828
flow differently from the

18
00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.286
rest. First, we're gonna

19
00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:39.744
hand off five net

20
00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:41.103
new pieces of work

21
00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.402
to our agentic layer

22
00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:43.941
that now ships end

23
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.878
to end. Plan, build,

24
00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:48.040
test, review, document. You'll

25
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.979
see the order of

26
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.939
magnitude improvement in your

27
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.856
engineering velocity. You'll see

28
00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:53.436
what it looks like

29
00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:54.975
to fully invest in

30
00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.673
your agentic layer. We'll

31
00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:57.453
work through a couple

32
00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:58.531
of additions that helps

33
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:59.790
us increase our engineering

34
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.289
velocity with our agents.
