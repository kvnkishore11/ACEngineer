1537
00:30:28.492 --> 00:30:30.051
time you shipped a

1538
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:31.071
chore or bug or

1539
00:30:31.071 --> 00:30:32.192
even a feature end

1540
00:30:32.192 --> 00:30:33.771
to end. What happens

1541
00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:34.791
next, right? When you

1542
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:35.811
get so good, when

1543
00:30:35.811 --> 00:30:36.990
you template your engineering

1544
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.631
so well in your

1545
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:38.830
codebase, something will

1546
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.931
happen. Okay. I want

1547
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.631
to zero in on

1548
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:41.550
this idea here. Something

1549
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.269
is going to happen

1550
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:44.210
once you become proficient

1551
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:46.213
at Outloop agentic coding.

1552
00:30:46.373 --> 00:30:48.011
You'll realize something incredible.

1553
00:30:48.051 --> 00:30:49.132
This human in the

1554
00:30:49.132 --> 00:30:50.191
loop model is a

1555
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:51.569
bottleneck. I'm not catching

1556
00:30:51.569 --> 00:30:52.608
any bugs anymore. I'm

1557
00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:53.848
not adding any value

1558
00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:55.048
outside of the agentic

1559
00:30:55.048 --> 00:30:56.067
layer. I'm going to

1560
00:30:56.067 --> 00:30:57.486
remove the human in

1561
00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:59.204
the loop review process

1562
00:30:59.244 --> 00:31:00.384
for this class of
