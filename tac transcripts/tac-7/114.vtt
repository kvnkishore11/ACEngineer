this stuff in your

2775
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.579
codebase set up

2776
00:57:02.699 --> 00:57:04.818
basic adws set up

2777
00:57:04.898 --> 00:57:06.318
basic agentic prompts get

2778
00:57:06.318 --> 00:57:07.918
your advantage start rolling

2779
00:57:07.918 --> 00:57:09.396
this into your code

2780
00:57:09.396 --> 00:57:10.657
bases the value here

2781
00:57:10.657 --> 00:57:11.916
is immense i'll see

2782

00:57:12.936 --> 00:57:13.815
we're going to reveal

2784
00:57:13.815 --> 00:57:15.373
the secret of agentic
