778
00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:00.337
understand what model set

779
00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:01.197
is. We're adding a

780
00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:03.115
knob to our capabilities,

781
00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:04.154
right? You can encode

782
00:16:04.215 --> 00:16:05.754
any information dense keyword

783
00:16:05.754 --> 00:16:06.692
that you want. You

784
00:16:06.692 --> 00:16:07.192
just have to make

785
00:16:07.192 --> 00:16:07.971
sure that your prompts

786
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:08.991
recognize it and pick

787
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:09.551
it up. What do

788
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:10.051
I mean by that?

789
00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:10.950
Of course, you know

790
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.989
that an IDK is

791
00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:13.528
an information dense keyword.

792
00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:14.527
These are keywords that

793
00:16:14.527 --> 00:16:16.326
affect your agents, right?

794
00:16:16.326 --> 00:16:17.725
They affect your prompts.

795
00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:18.864
We've encoded this into

796
00:16:18.864 --> 00:16:19.962
our prompts into our

797
00:16:19.962 --> 00:16:21.481
ADW. So What does

798
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.061
this model set have

799
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:22.620
you do? We know

800
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.480
that we can specify

801
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.080
features, chores, bugs, and

802
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.438
we can select our

803
00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:28.038
AI developer workflow. But

804
00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:29.018
of course, you're going

805
00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:29.756
to want to pass

806
00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:30.976
in more information into
