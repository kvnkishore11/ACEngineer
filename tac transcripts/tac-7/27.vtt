650
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.210
and more work to

651
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.428
our agents. All right.

652
00:13:31.469 --> 00:13:32.168
So things are going

653
00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:32.748
to go wrong. We're

654
00:13:32.748 --> 00:13:33.206
going to need to

655
00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:33.986
hop in the environment,

656
00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:34.885
understand what went wrong

657
00:13:34.885 --> 00:13:35.885
with our agents so

658
00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:37.004
that we can not

659
00:13:37.004 --> 00:13:38.524
fix the issue directly,

660
00:13:38.524 --> 00:13:39.024
but so that we

661
00:13:39.024 --> 00:13:40.102
can hop up to

662
00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:41.501
our top level and

663
00:13:41.557 --> 00:13:43.797
improve the agentic layer

664
00:13:43.817 --> 00:13:44.855
of our codebase.

665
00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:45.336
I hope you can

666
00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.475
see the theme here.

667
00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:47.653
We're building the system

668
00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:48.653
that builds the system.

669
00:13:48.653 --> 00:13:49.972
We're not solving the

670
00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:51.631
problem directly anymore. Of

671
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:52.192
course, we will be

672
00:13:52.192 --> 00:13:52.892
doing that, right? Your

673
00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:54.370
domain specific problem is

674
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.610
everything, but the impact

675
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.309
you can have, the

676
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.188
rate in which you

677
00:13:57.188 --> 00:13:58.308
can solve your specific

678
00:13:58.308 --> 00:13:59.168
problem can now be

679
00:13:59.168 --> 00:14:01.267
drastically scaled up when
