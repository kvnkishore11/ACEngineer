623
00:12:58.337 --> 00:13:00.378
can say code trees,

624
00:13:00.457 --> 00:13:01.636
8F. Let's actually use

625
00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:02.496
a real, let's use

626
00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:03.376
a real ID. So

627
00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:04.515
we have this agent

628
00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:05.936
operating here and this

629
00:13:05.936 --> 00:13:07.215
agent just implemented its

630
00:13:07.235 --> 00:13:08.534
solution. So if we

631
00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:09.813
copy this ID here,

632
00:13:09.813 --> 00:13:11.254
we can open up

633
00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:12.600
this agent environment right

634
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.421
now. And we can

635
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:14.519
just watch what's going

636
00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:15.198
on. So we open

637
00:13:15.198 --> 00:13:15.979
up this, we have

638
00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:16.739
a brand new instance,

639
00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:17.857
we're in the dedicated

640
00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:18.996
environment that this agent

641
00:13:18.996 --> 00:13:19.735
is operating in. Check

642
00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:20.255
this out. You can

643
00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:20.975
see the branch down

644
00:13:20.975 --> 00:13:22.514
there, right? Chore task

645
00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:24.254
issue 39, there's the

646
00:13:24.254 --> 00:13:25.293
ADWID. Okay. Think in

647
00:13:25.293 --> 00:13:26.231
the gray, we're not

648
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:27.850
jumping to Outloop. We're

649
00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:29.350
progressively handing off more

650
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.210
and more work to
