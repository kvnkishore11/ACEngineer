806
00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:30.976
in more information into

807
00:16:30.976 --> 00:16:32.336
your workflows. You're gonna

808
00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:33.096
wanna tweak some of

809
00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:35.153
the agentic variables, and

810
00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:35.634
this is one of

811
00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:36.433
them. So what does

812
00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:37.452
this do? Our model

813
00:16:37.452 --> 00:16:39.032
set changes the set

814
00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.032
of models that runs

815
00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.010
against our workflow. This

816
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.831
is very simple. If

817
00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:43.389
we open up agents.py,

818
00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:44.837
we're gonna get to

819
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.057
our agents file and

820
00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:46.596
you can see exactly

821
00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:47.336
what this does, right?

822
00:16:47.336 --> 00:16:48.035
We have a map

823
00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:49.696
between our custom slash

824
00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:51.195
commands, right? Our prompts

825
00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:52.774
that run our agents

826
00:16:52.793 --> 00:16:53.514
and every one of

827
00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:54.812
them maps to either

828
00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:56.332
a base model or

829
00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:57.392
a heavy model, right?

830
00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:58.131
And you can see

831
00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:58.850
here in some of

832
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.850
our heavy models, right?

833
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.830
Heavy forward opus, we
