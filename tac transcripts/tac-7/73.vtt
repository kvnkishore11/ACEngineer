1842
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.320
application. There's no real

1843
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.659
risk here, but that's

1844
00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:33.818
all missing the point,

1845
00:36:33.818 --> 00:36:34.777
right? I get that

1846
00:36:34.797 --> 00:36:35.617
real code basis have

1847
00:36:35.617 --> 00:36:36.597
a lot more complexity,

1848
00:36:36.597 --> 00:36:37.056
a lot more code,

1849
00:36:37.056 --> 00:36:38.215
a lot more wear

1850
00:36:38.215 --> 00:36:39.635
and tear legacy code,

1851
00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:40.514
code debt, blah, blah,

1852
00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:41.594
blah. Okay. I get

1853
00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:42.054
it. I've been doing

1854
00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:42.534
this for over a

1855
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:43.333
decade and a half.

1856
00:36:43.353 --> 00:36:44.472
Okay. I know how

1857
00:36:44.472 --> 00:36:45.231
these systems look. I

1858
00:36:45.231 --> 00:36:45.791
know how they work.

1859
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:46.711
Let me just provide

1860
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:47.510
you with a concrete

1861
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.130
counter narrative for you

1862
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.789
to help you push

1863
00:36:50.789 --> 00:36:51.768
into the future and

1864
00:36:51.768 --> 00:36:53.188
not stick with the

1865
00:36:53.208 --> 00:36:54.786
current narrative. This doesn't

1866
00:36:54.786 --> 00:36:55.726
happen all at once,

1867
00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:56.766
right? Like I mentioned,

1868
00:36:56.865 --> 00:36:57.726
we build this out.

1869
00:36:57.878 --> 00:36:58.438
one piece at a

1870
00:36:58.438 --> 00:37:00.077
time, okay? We're in
