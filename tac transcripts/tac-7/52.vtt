1314
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:00.020
are images and you

1315
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.681
can of course take

1316
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.660
this a step further.

1317
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.599
You can build any

1318
00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.279
media review system that

1319
00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:05.038
you need to for

1320
00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:05.878
your agents to prove

1321
00:26:05.878 --> 00:26:06.259
to you that the

1322
00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:06.939
work is done, right?

1323
00:26:06.939 --> 00:26:08.057
The next most obvious

1324
00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:08.778
one to build out

1325
00:26:08.778 --> 00:26:10.594
is video. Right? Have

1326
00:26:10.594 --> 00:26:11.813
your agents take video,

1327
00:26:11.992 --> 00:26:12.573
upload it to a

1328
00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:13.971
cloud bucket, and then

1329
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:15.391
post the URLs right

1330
00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:16.829
here on GitHub issues

1331
00:26:16.829 --> 00:26:17.890
or whatever review system

1332
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:18.648
you want to use.

1333
00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:20.128
Remember the Peter framework

1334
00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:21.548
and get a great

1335
00:26:21.548 --> 00:26:23.487
review, right? It's very

1336
00:26:23.487 --> 00:26:24.425
clear that, you know,

1337
00:26:24.425 --> 00:26:25.766
planning is important. Building

1338
00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:26.744
is important. Testing is

1339
00:26:26.744 --> 00:26:28.443
important. Review is especially

1340
00:26:28.443 --> 00:26:29.983
important, right? It's proof
