1736
00:34:29.766 --> 00:34:31.485
with Tactical Agentic Coding.

1737
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:32.346
Start small, solve a

1738
00:34:32.346 --> 00:34:33.905
small problem set, and

1739
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:34.605
then scale it up,

1740
00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:36.364
okay? Especially for zero-touch

1741
00:34:36.364 --> 00:34:37.222
engineering. So let's say

1742
00:34:37.222 --> 00:34:38.222
that you need to

1743
00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:39.641
update the background color

1744
00:34:39.641 --> 00:34:40.461
of your website or

1745
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:41.840
update some styles, right?

1746
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.420
Something simple, right? Frontend

1747
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.159
is a great example

1748
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.119
because frontend is simple.

1749
00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:46.759
If you build it

1750
00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:47.478
right, it should be

1751
00:34:47.478 --> 00:34:50.177
simple. Styles, components, APIs.

1752
00:34:50.217 --> 00:34:50.836
This is just, of

1753
00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:52.135
course, a micro example.

1754
00:34:52.135 --> 00:34:52.615
I just want to

1755
00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:53.175
stress the point in

1756
00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:55.193
your background color, update,

1757
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:58.547
Torque, ADW, SDLC, ZTE,

1758
00:34:58.568 --> 00:35:00.804
Zero Touch Engineering, ISO,
