1786
00:35:29.916 --> 00:35:30.896
workflow. And you can

1787
00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:31.637
see here, right? We

1788
00:35:31.637 --> 00:35:32.976
get this important message

1789
00:35:32.976 --> 00:35:34.235
here this workflow does

1790
00:35:34.235 --> 00:35:34.954
all of this for

1791
00:35:34.954 --> 00:35:35.454
us, right? And this

1792
00:35:35.454 --> 00:35:36.333
is the key, plan,

1793
00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:37.853
build, test, review, generate,

1794
00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:39.112
ship. This is where

1795
00:35:39.112 --> 00:35:40.012
it all ends up.

1796
00:35:40.132 --> 00:35:41.452
And yes, we're looking

1797
00:35:41.452 --> 00:35:42.411
at primitive versions of

1798
00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:43.630
this. Yes, it's a

1799
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.590
simple thing to do,

1800
00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:46.286
but yes, this is

1801
00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:48.025
still critically important. ZTE,

1802
00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:50.143
zero touch engineering. We're

1803
00:35:50.143 --> 00:35:50.664
starting out with the

1804
00:35:50.664 --> 00:35:51.762
plan phase. It'll run

1805
00:35:51.762 --> 00:35:52.503
a little bit faster

1806
00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:53.302
because this is just

1807
00:35:53.302 --> 00:35:54.061
a chore running our

1808
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:54.942
base model set, but

1809
00:35:54.942 --> 00:35:55.601
you get the idea,

1810
00:35:55.702 --> 00:35:56.501
right? So this is

1811
00:35:56.501 --> 00:35:57.501
not worth watching. Let

1812
00:35:57.501 --> 00:35:58.400
me just talk about

1813
00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.659
this idea a bit

1814
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:00.400
more. And then let's
