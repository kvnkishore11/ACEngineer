00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:30.687
lesson six tactic has

706
00:14:30.687 --> 00:14:31.787
not been broken this

707
00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:33.226
is really important for

708
00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:34.407
scaling we have one

709
00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.086
agent running one prompt

710
00:14:36.265 --> 00:14:37.885
with a single purpose

711
00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:39.086
now In order to

712
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.004
combat some of the

713
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.743
state management issues that

714
00:14:41.743 --> 00:14:42.442
you're going to run

715
00:14:42.442 --> 00:14:44.139
into, we do have

716
00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:46.836
this state.json object, and

717
00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:47.495
we're starting to track

718
00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:48.575
more and more information

719
00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:49.294
here, kind of meta

720
00:14:49.294 --> 00:14:51.092
information to pass through

721
00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:52.311
to your ADWs and

722
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:53.629
to your individual agents.

723
00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:54.922
expect to have to

724
00:14:54.922 --> 00:14:55.701
add some type of

725
00:14:55.721 --> 00:14:57.640
state object inside your

726
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.301
dedicated agent environments, but

727
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.899
