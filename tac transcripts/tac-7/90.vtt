2291
00:44:58.927 --> 00:45:00.485
velocity scale. This is

2292
00:45:00.485 --> 00:45:02.184
an advanced edge next

2293
00:45:02.184 --> 00:45:03.083
level concept, but this

2294
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:03.724
is something you wanna

2295
00:45:03.724 --> 00:45:04.722
be working toward. This

2296
00:45:04.722 --> 00:45:05.902
is the tactic of

2297
00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:07.644
lesson seven. Target zero

2298
00:45:07.644 --> 00:45:09.003
touch engineering. In the

2299
00:45:09.003 --> 00:45:09.762
end, you want no

2300
00:45:09.782 --> 00:45:11.481
overview, no oversight because

2301
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:12.621
it's been embedded into

2302
00:45:12.621 --> 00:45:13.760
your agents, right? Your

2303
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.579
agents have gotten so

2304
00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:15.677
good and your templates

2305
00:45:15.677 --> 00:45:16.617
have gotten so great

2306
00:45:16.617 --> 00:45:17.876
that your agents know

2307
00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:18.635
how you would do

2308
00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:19.853
the work. And you

2309
00:45:19.853 --> 00:45:20.414
know, how is this

2310
00:45:20.414 --> 00:45:21.692
possible? It's only possible

2311
00:45:21.692 --> 00:45:22.751
because you've encoded your

2312
00:45:22.751 --> 00:45:24.090
engineering. You've told your

2313
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.188
agents, you've instructed your

2314
00:45:25.188 --> 00:45:26.427
system, you've trained your

2315
00:45:26.427 --> 00:45:27.527
system to know when

2316
00:45:27.527 --> 00:45:28.106
things are ready for

2317
00:45:28.106 --> 00:45:29.349
production. Right, maybe you

2318
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:30.606
add another step on
