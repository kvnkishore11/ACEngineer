2261
00:44:29.005 --> 00:44:30.125
this, right? There is

2262
00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:30.844
no value in me

2263
00:44:30.844 --> 00:44:32.043
reviewing this. So there

2264
00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:32.463
we go. We just

2265
00:44:32.463 --> 00:44:34.023
got the documentation phase.

2266
00:44:34.043 --> 00:44:34.702
And in a moment

2267
00:44:34.702 --> 00:44:35.521
here, this is going

2268
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:36.202
to ship all the

2269
00:44:36.202 --> 00:44:36.922
way out to prod.

2270
00:44:36.942 --> 00:44:37.860
In our case, prod

2271
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.860
is just pushing to

2272
00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.900
the main branch. There's

2273
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.719
nothing very easy to

2274
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:41.599
see here, but for

2275
00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.079
you, this will be

2276
00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.237
your deploy, go to

2277
00:44:43.237 --> 00:44:44.777
staging, go to production,

2278
00:44:44.777 --> 00:44:46.016
however your engineering is

2279
00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.014
configured. How are we

2280
00:44:47.014 --> 00:44:47.775
going to round out

2281
00:44:48.034 --> 00:44:49.574
tactical agent decoding, right?

2282
00:44:49.594 --> 00:44:50.652
What has this all

2283
00:44:50.652 --> 00:44:52.012
been about? Obviously here,

2284
00:44:52.012 --> 00:44:52.431
you can see the

2285
00:44:52.431 --> 00:44:53.311
trend. It's about the

2286
00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:54.869
agentic layer, but let

2287
00:44:54.869 --> 00:44:55.429
me just share the

2288
00:44:55.429 --> 00:44:56.648
secret with you. Zero

2289
00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:57.768
touch engineering is the

2290
00:44:57.768 --> 00:44:58.927
next stage in the

2291
00:44:58.927 --> 00:45:00.485
velocity scale. This is
