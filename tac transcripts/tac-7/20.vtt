470
00:09:59.673 --> 00:10:00.173
and this is what

471
00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:01.631
we fired off on

472
00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:02.431
most of our runs

473
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:04.169
here, right? ADW, SDLC,

474
00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:07.727
SDLC, SDLC, SDLC here.

475
00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:08.706
And then here is

476
00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:09.226
the only one where

477
00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:10.206
we did in patch.

478
00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:10.874
All right, just a

479
00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:11.952
simple cleanup, right? It's

480
00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:12.913
just text. We don't

481
00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:13.672
need to go all

482
00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:15.111
into the SDLC to

483
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:16.250
solve this problem. Although

484
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.010
if you wanted to,

485
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.791
you could. This is

486
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:18.269
the SDLC. This is

487
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.109
the software developer lifecycle

488
00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:20.788
end to end. This

489
00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:21.568
is what we've been

490
00:10:21.568 --> 00:10:22.288
building up to, all

491
00:10:22.327 --> 00:10:23.368
right? This is full

492
00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:24.807
automation across the software

493
00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:25.986
developer lifecycle. There are

494
00:10:25.986 --> 00:10:26.905
many different flavors of

495
00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:27.645
this. You're going to

496
00:10:27.645 --> 00:10:28.265
want to tweak it

497
00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:28.985
and make it your

498
00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:30.044
own, but this is
