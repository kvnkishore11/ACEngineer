00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:32.428
agent-based containerization frameworks. Whatever

600
00:12:32.428 --> 00:12:33.847
you use doesn't matter.

601
00:12:33.888 --> 00:12:34.567
Don't get caught on

602
00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:35.586
that. Get caught on

603
00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:37.006
scaling up the agentic

604
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:37.846
layer so that you

605
00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:40.524
can multiply your agents.

606
00:12:40.664 --> 00:12:41.563
You want agents operating

607
00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:42.703
in parallel, in dedicated

608
00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:45.923
isolated, safe environments. Okay.

609
00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:46.702
And then you want

610
00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:47.081
to be able to

611
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.282
quickly plug in to

612
00:12:48.282 --> 00:12:48.782
any one of these

613
00:12:48.782 --> 00:12:50.421
environments, right? At any

614
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:51.441
moment in time, I

615
00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:52.799
can come into one

616
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:53.580
of these work trees,

617
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.059
right? So say I

618
00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:55.418
wanted to, I can

619
00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:56.259
do something like this,

620
00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.119
right? At any moment

621
00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:57.719
in time, I can

622
00:12:57.719 --> 00:12:58.337
come in and I

623
00:12:58.337 --> 00:13:00.378
can say code trees,
