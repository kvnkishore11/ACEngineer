WEBVTT

247
00:05:28.747 --> 00:05:30.826
products CSV export looks

248
00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:31.745
like this. We have

249
00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:32.964
the chart icon and

250
00:05:32.964 --> 00:05:34.004
then CSV, but if

251
00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:35.983
we select a product,

252
00:05:36.543 --> 00:05:38.141
you'll see something here

253
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.916
We have mismatched text.

254
00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:40.495
Okay, so this is

255
00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:41.735
just a small, simple

256
00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:42.514
bug. So we wanna

257
00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:43.553
align this. This is

258
00:05:43.553 --> 00:05:44.173
gonna be a simple

259
00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:45.293
high level prompt. And

260
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:45.892
here we're not even

261
00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.331
gonna use the full

262
00:05:47.372 --> 00:05:48.990
SDLC workflow, which I'll

263
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.449
break down in a

264
00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.788
moment. We're going to

265
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.427
use a simple patch

266
00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:54.346
workflow. Okay, so check

267
00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:55.526
this out, five issues.

268
00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:56.065
We're gonna fire them

269
00:05:56.185 --> 00:05:57.425
all off back to

270
00:05:57.425 --> 00:05:58.903
back. Our Outloop agentic

271
00:05:58.903 --> 00:05:59.723
system is gonna pick

272
00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:00.641
up all these events
