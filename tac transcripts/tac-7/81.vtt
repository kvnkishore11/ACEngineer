2059
00:40:29.545 --> 00:40:30.405
you sit, you wait,

2060
00:40:30.445 --> 00:40:31.943
you iterate, you retest,

2061
00:40:32.043 --> 00:40:33.003
and you do all

2062
00:40:33.003 --> 00:40:34.483
this stupid stuff that

2063
00:40:34.483 --> 00:40:34.983
you can have your

2064
00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:36.282
agents do. Okay, tell

2065
00:40:36.282 --> 00:40:37.501
me who wins this.

2066
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:38.601
Tell me who makes

2067
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:39.641
their business more money.

2068
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:40.641
Tell me which engineer

2069
00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:41.219
is better. Okay. I'm

2070
00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:42.840
getting like getting super

2071
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.498
into this because it's

2072
00:40:43.518 --> 00:40:44.478
so important. This is

2073
00:40:44.478 --> 00:40:45.557
it guys. This is,

2074
00:40:45.617 --> 00:40:46.378
this is the peak.

2075
00:40:46.378 --> 00:40:47.038
This is the pinnacle.

2076
00:40:47.038 --> 00:40:48.036
This is the change

2077
00:40:48.036 --> 00:40:49.056
that you have to

2078
00:40:49.056 --> 00:40:50.755
make, right? There's the

2079
00:40:50.755 --> 00:40:52.195
code. There's the ADWs,

2080
00:40:52.195 --> 00:40:52.635
right? We're going to

2081
00:40:52.635 --> 00:40:53.574
break things down. We're

2082
00:40:53.594 --> 00:40:54.074
going to go from

2083
00:40:54.074 --> 00:40:55.333
the compositional level up

2084
00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:56.913
to concrete examples in

2085
00:40:56.913 --> 00:40:57.652
lesson eight, but we're

2086
00:40:57.652 --> 00:40:58.431
going to round things

2087
00:40:58.431 --> 00:40:59.311
out in a fantastic

2088
00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:00.610
fashion. But the real
