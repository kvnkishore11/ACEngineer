2485
00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:01.302
confidence to one day

2486
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.800
run one prompt and

2487
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.518
have everything shipped to

2488
00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:05.697
production. Don't run toward

2489
00:49:05.697 --> 00:49:06.418
the future, don't walk

2490
00:49:06.418 --> 00:49:07.777
toward it, sprint into

2491
00:49:07.777 --> 00:49:08.615
the future. This is

2492
00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:09.894
live, let's go ahead.

2493
00:49:09.894 --> 00:49:11.175
You can see here's

2494
00:49:11.175 --> 00:49:12.574
the blue color. I'm

2495
00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:14.152
going to open a

2496
00:49:14.152 --> 00:49:16.233
code, git pool, origin

2497
00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:19.092
main, and look at

2498
00:49:19.092 --> 00:49:21.271
that. Our agents shifted

2499
00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:21.990
end to end. It's

2500
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.010
in production. This is

2501
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.130
zero touch engineering. This

2502
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:24.731
is the future of

2503
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:25.809
engineering. This is what

2504
00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:27.230
happens when you use

2505
00:49:27.269 --> 00:49:28.648
the tactics of agentic

2506
00:49:28.648 --> 00:49:30.028
coding. All right, so
