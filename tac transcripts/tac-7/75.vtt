1894
00:37:29.842 --> 00:37:31.141
class that you're working

1895
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:32.481
on end to end

1896
00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:33.880
with no oversight? How

1897
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.878
else will you know

1898
00:37:34.978 --> 00:37:35.878
unless you're trying to

1899
00:37:35.878 --> 00:37:37.217
do this? Okay. I

1900
00:37:37.217 --> 00:37:38.137
can guarantee you right

1901
00:37:38.137 --> 00:37:39.235
now, you are doing

1902
00:37:39.235 --> 00:37:40.635
engineering work you do

1903
00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:41.655
not have to do.

1904
00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:42.474
I can tell you

1905
00:37:42.474 --> 00:37:43.594
that as a fact.

1906
00:37:43.793 --> 00:37:44.932
Okay. Unless you're one

1907
00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:46.072
of the one fractions

1908
00:37:46.072 --> 00:37:46.632
of a percent of

1909
00:37:46.632 --> 00:37:48.190
engineer that likely have

1910
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.889
already been following a

1911
00:37:48.889 --> 00:37:49.610
lot of my work,

1912
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.469
there is work that

1913
00:37:50.469 --> 00:37:51.289
you are just doing

1914
00:37:51.289 --> 00:37:51.807
that you do not

1915
00:37:51.807 --> 00:37:52.588
need to do. Everything

1916
00:37:52.588 --> 00:37:53.547
starts small and then

1917
00:37:53.547 --> 00:37:54.646
it compounds. Your first

1918
00:37:54.646 --> 00:37:56.137
agent should ship a

1919
00:37:56.137 --> 00:37:57.396
class of chores that

1920
00:37:57.396 --> 00:37:58.516
you know you can

1921
00:37:58.516 --> 00:37:59.576
ship over and over,

1922
00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:00.476
right? Simple stuff like
