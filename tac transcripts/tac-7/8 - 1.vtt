168
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.519
run like various levels

169
00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.998
of difficulty. So here

170
00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:04.699
I want increase drag

171
00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:05.998
and drop surface area.

172
00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:07.239
Paste all this in,

173
00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.138
feature, software developer lifecycle,

174
00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:10.397
isolated. We'll break this

175
00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:11.098
all down in just

176
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:12.322
a moment here. And

177
00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:12.641
you can see the

178
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.741
prompt. We want to

179
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.241
increase the drop zone

180
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.201
of the surface area

181
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:16.740
so that we can

182
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.000
drag and drop over

183
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.779
any element. Feature two,

184
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.119
I want JSON export.

185
00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:23.379
There's the prompt. You

186
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.879
can see nice, simple,

187
00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.298
high-level prompt. Our agents

188
00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:27.538
handle the rest. I

189
00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:28.456
want the ability to

190
00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.456
create random data based
