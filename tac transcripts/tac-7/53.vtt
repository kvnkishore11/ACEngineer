1341
00:26:30.042 --> 00:26:31.182
of value. Like we

1342
00:26:31.182 --> 00:26:32.061
talked about in our

1343
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:33.241
previous lesson, It lets

1344
00:26:33.241 --> 00:26:34.421
your agents communicate to

1345
00:26:34.421 --> 00:26:35.440
you is what was

1346
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.759
asked for what was

1347
00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.798
built. Okay. And then

1348
00:26:37.798 --> 00:26:39.316
we of course document

1349
00:26:39.316 --> 00:26:39.996
it. We're going to

1350
00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:41.453
have some documentation here.

1351
00:26:41.453 --> 00:26:42.173
We can just quickly

1352
00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:43.153
search that since we're

1353
00:26:43.153 --> 00:26:43.991
on the branch or

1354
00:26:43.991 --> 00:26:45.270
agent created that's app

1355
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.588
docs enhance drop zone.

1356
00:26:47.608 --> 00:26:48.508
And now we have

1357
00:26:48.508 --> 00:26:50.166
this documentation. It references

1358
00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:51.424
the original spec, right?

1359
00:26:51.424 --> 00:26:52.604
Our codebase is

1360
00:26:52.683 --> 00:26:54.182
operating itself, right? It's

1361
00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:56.006
documenting. It's referring to

1362
00:26:56.006 --> 00:26:57.085
the original spec. The

1363
00:26:57.085 --> 00:26:58.025
reason why we planned

1364
00:26:58.025 --> 00:26:58.943
is much more than

1365
00:26:58.943 --> 00:26:59.943
just to ship code,

1366
00:26:59.943 --> 00:27:01.403
right? We have artifacts,
