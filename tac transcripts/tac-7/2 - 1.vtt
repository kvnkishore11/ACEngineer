34
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.289
velocity with our agents.

35
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.149
Next, we'll break down

36
00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.506
how we've parallelized our

37
00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.525
AI developer workflows using

38
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.084
Git work trees. This

39
00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:09.123
enables multiple agent pipelines

40
00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.141
to execute simultaneously in

41
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:12.519
isolated environments on a

42
00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.399
single device. Of course,

43
00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.257
you can tweak this

44
00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:15.977
and make it your

45
00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:16.677
own. You can set

46
00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:17.936
up your own containers.

47
00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:18.954
You can use Docker.

48
00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:19.953
We're keeping it simple

49
00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:20.793
and we're focusing on

50
00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:21.893
the key idea of

51
00:01:21.893 --> 00:01:24.430
scaling beyond what in-loop

52
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.909
agentic coding can offer.

53
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.808
Then midway through the

54
00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:27.548
lesson, I want to

55
00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:28.727
introduce you to the

56
00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:30.525
third level of agentic
