1228
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.125
that new branch. And

1229
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:30.726
we should get the

1230
00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:31.684
browser open up pretty

1231
00:24:31.684 --> 00:24:32.505
soon. You can see

1232
00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:33.443
we have open here,

1233
00:24:33.443 --> 00:24:34.223
fire it up for

1234
00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:35.103
us on our local

1235
00:24:35.103 --> 00:24:36.502
host on this device,

1236
00:24:36.502 --> 00:24:38.122
right? My machine here.

1237
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:39.740
I'm using my resources

1238
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.300
to validate my agent's

1239
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.720
work. Stop apps, reset

1240
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.179
database, start in the

1241
00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:44.999
background. And now we're

1242
00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:45.499
gonna open up the

1243
00:24:45.499 --> 00:24:46.877
browser. Don't do this

1244
00:24:46.877 --> 00:24:48.517
hands-on manual engineering work.

1245
00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:49.396
Teach your agent how

1246
00:24:49.396 --> 00:24:50.556
to do it once

1247
00:24:50.556 --> 00:24:51.355
and then run it

1248
00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:52.135
over and over and

1249
00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:53.394
over again and scale

1250
00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:54.154
it across your team.

1251
00:24:54.314 --> 00:24:55.013
Okay, there it is.

1252
00:24:55.013 --> 00:24:57.073
This has popped open

1253
00:24:57.073 --> 00:24:58.093
for us now. And

1254
00:24:58.093 --> 00:24:59.511
remember we're testing our

1255
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.332
drag and drop feature.
