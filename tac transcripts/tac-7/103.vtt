2603
00:51:29.684 --> 00:51:30.344
if you do this

2604
00:51:30.344 --> 00:51:32.003
right, it will change

2605
00:51:32.123 --> 00:51:33.204
everything. What we're gonna

2606
00:51:33.204 --> 00:51:34.463
do next in lesson

2607
00:51:34.463 --> 00:51:35.284
eight, we're gonna blow

2608
00:51:35.284 --> 00:51:36.182
this idea wide open,

2609
00:51:36.182 --> 00:51:37.902
okay? The primitives are

2610
00:51:37.922 --> 00:51:39.443
the atoms of agentic

2611
00:51:39.443 --> 00:51:40.902
engineering. Master them and

2612
00:51:40.902 --> 00:51:41.722
you can build any

2613
00:51:41.722 --> 00:51:43.561
molecular structure you need.

2614
00:51:43.641 --> 00:51:44.262
Think about what this

2615
00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:45.762
means. Every codebase

2616
00:51:45.762 --> 00:51:47.061
has unique problems. Every

2617
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:48.440
team has unique workflows.

2618
00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:49.699
Every domain has unique

2619
00:51:49.699 --> 00:51:51.978
challenges, but primitives remain

2620
00:51:51.978 --> 00:51:54.056
constant and composable. In

2621
00:51:54.056 --> 00:51:55.217
lesson eight, your final

2622
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:56.235
lesson, we're going to

2623
00:51:56.235 --> 00:51:57.474
focus in on this.

2624
00:51:57.655 --> 00:51:58.135
We're going to do

2625
00:51:58.135 --> 00:51:59.293
two things. We're going

2626
00:51:59.293 --> 00:52:01.713
to revisit the atoms
