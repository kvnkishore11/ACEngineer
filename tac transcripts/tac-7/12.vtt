272
00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:00.641
up all these events

273
00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:01.461
and fire them off

274
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:02.081
and get to work

275
00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:03.240
for us one by

276
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.379
one. We've learned to

277
00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.899
stay out the loop.

278
00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:07.038
Let's kick this off.

279
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.629
and we'll make sure

280
00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:09.668
that our agent is

281
00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:10.826
picking up these events.

282
00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:11.326
So we'll hop over

283
00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:12.466
to the screen. If

284
00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:13.584
we open up code,

285
00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:14.603
you can see the

286
00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:15.982
events coming in, our

287
00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:17.701
agent, as full control

288
00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:19.201
over this device. And

289
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:19.959
we'll break down this

290
00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:21.339
work here in just

291
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.738
a moment. Okay. And

292
00:06:22.738 --> 00:06:23.617
of course we have

293
00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:24.697
high level logging coming

294
00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:25.956
into our review system

295
00:06:26.057 --> 00:06:27.216
where our agents are

296
00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:29.036
ADWs. They're updating this

297
00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.475
issue live with the
