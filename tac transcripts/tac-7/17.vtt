401
00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:30.887
Our agents do all

402
00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:31.627
of it for us.

403
00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:32.907
If there's something missing

404
00:08:32.907 --> 00:08:34.126
in your usual developer

405
00:08:34.126 --> 00:08:36.125
workflow, you embedded inside

406
00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:37.225
the agentic layer of

407
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.206
your codebase, all

408
00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:40.116
right? Let's recap the

409
00:08:40.116 --> 00:08:41.256
key pieces of our

410
00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:42.556
agentic layer. The top

411
00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.115
level, the highest compositional

412
00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:44.934
unit, the best place

413
00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:45.735
to start is ADWs.

414
00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:47.254
And so you notice

415
00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:48.712
here, we have several

416
00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:50.652
additional workflows. The most

417
00:08:50.652 --> 00:08:52.471
important one being this,

418
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.590
ADW SDLC ISO, Software

419
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.168
Developer Lifecycle Isolated. And

420
00:08:58.168 --> 00:08:59.528
just below this, we

421
00:08:59.528 --> 00:09:02.126
have SDLC ZTE ISO.
