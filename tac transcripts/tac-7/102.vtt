2578
00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:00.362
happen. Once you truly

2579
00:51:00.362 --> 00:51:01.141
get this and start

2580
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:02.101
building it out, once

2581
00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:03.420
you see the productivity

2582
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.201
gains, you're gonna have

2583
00:51:04.201 --> 00:51:06.019
several aha moments and

2584
00:51:06.099 --> 00:51:07.280
then you'll realize that

2585
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.139
you can unlock this

2586
00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:09.139
value for your team

2587
00:51:09.219 --> 00:51:09.998
and for your org.

2588
00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:11.498
In-loop agent decoding is

2589
00:51:11.498 --> 00:51:12.777
the lowest hanging fruit.

2590
00:51:12.777 --> 00:51:13.617
Do not remain here.

2591
00:51:13.617 --> 00:51:14.677
You are an engineer,

2592
00:51:14.777 --> 00:51:15.876
not a coder. Build

2593
00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:16.896
the system that builds

2594
00:51:16.896 --> 00:51:18.074
the system and you

2595
00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.213
will become an irreplaceable

2596
00:51:20.213 --> 00:51:21.666
engineer. Focus on the

2597
00:51:21.686 --> 00:51:23.206
agentic layer over everything

2598
00:51:23.226 --> 00:51:24.385
else. Clear your schedule,

2599
00:51:24.385 --> 00:51:25.525
tell your boss, tell

2600
00:51:25.525 --> 00:51:26.525
your lead, tell your

2601
00:51:26.525 --> 00:51:27.905
team, and most importantly,

2602
00:51:27.905 --> 00:51:29.684
tell yourself, okay? Because

2603
00:51:29.684 --> 00:51:30.344
if you do this
