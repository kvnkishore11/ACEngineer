1707
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.207
over and over, the

1708
00:34:00.207 --> 00:34:02.105
next step, is ZTE,

1709
00:34:02.105 --> 00:34:02.865
let them ship to

1710
00:34:02.865 --> 00:34:04.223
production. And ship does

1711
00:34:04.223 --> 00:34:04.843
exactly what you think

1712
00:34:04.843 --> 00:34:05.981
it does. It doesn't

1713
00:34:06.001 --> 00:34:06.821
really matter how you

1714
00:34:06.821 --> 00:34:07.740
do this. You can

1715
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.201
do it however you

1716
00:34:08.201 --> 00:34:09.679
want. Just to express

1717
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.559
the point here, our

1718
00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:11.797
ship command is just

1719
00:34:11.797 --> 00:34:12.976
gonna check out main

1720
00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:14.315
on the root repository

1721
00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:15.396
outside of the tree.

1722
00:34:15.396 --> 00:34:16.375
It's going to merge

1723
00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:17.233
in the feature branch

1724
00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:17.733
and then it's gonna

1725
00:34:17.733 --> 00:34:18.952
pose success. That's it.

1726
00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:19.751
So just close the

1727
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:20.851
PR, push the work

1728
00:34:20.851 --> 00:34:22.271
into production, deploy the

1729
00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:23.969
pipeline, ship. And the

1730
00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.509
whole point here is

1731
00:34:25.568 --> 00:34:26.048
we're going to do

1732
00:34:26.048 --> 00:34:26.827
something small, right? We're

1733
00:34:26.827 --> 00:34:27.668
going to start small

1734
00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:28.427
because this is the

1735
00:34:28.427 --> 00:34:29.726
best place to start

1736
00:34:29.766 --> 00:34:31.485
with Tactical Agentic Coding.
