00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:01.539
size constantly scaling up,

1604
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.900
streak constantly increasing as

1605
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.059
you solve and ship

1606
00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:06.259
problem classes back to

1607
00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:06.959
back to back with

1608
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:07.919
one attempt and you'll

1609
00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:09.058
drop your presence down

1610
00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:10.078
to one. You'll let

1611
00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:11.538
your agent ship end

1612
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:12.518
to end. When you

1613
00:32:12.518 --> 00:32:14.038
do this, you've achieved

1614
00:32:14.038 --> 00:32:16.269
zero touch. Engineering. The

1615
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:18.467
best Outloop agent decoders

1616
00:32:18.606 --> 00:32:19.286
have a presence of

1617
00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:20.144
two. You show up

1618
00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:21.023
at the prompt and

1619
00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:21.663
you show up at

1620
00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:22.462
the review, just like

1621
00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:23.582
we were here, right?

1622
00:32:23.582 --> 00:32:25.119
Our presence for this

1623
00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:26.039
drag and drop feature

1624
00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:27.298
was two. Okay. We

1625
00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:28.537
increased it by going

1626
00:32:28.537 --> 00:32:29.476
into the loop, but

1627
00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:30.555
we only needed two,
