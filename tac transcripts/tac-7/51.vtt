1284
00:25:28.915 --> 00:25:30.496
out. Nice, clean drag

1285
00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:31.375
and drop. Check that

1286
00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:32.536
out. And down here

1287
00:25:32.536 --> 00:25:33.236
as well, you can

1288
00:25:33.236 --> 00:25:33.894
see that's working on

1289
00:25:33.914 --> 00:25:35.174
both sections. Let's go

1290
00:25:35.174 --> 00:25:35.835
ahead and drop it

1291
00:25:35.835 --> 00:25:36.835
here. And look at

1292
00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:37.355
that. We have our

1293
00:25:37.355 --> 00:25:38.355
events table. I'll go

1294
00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:39.913
ahead and delete products

1295
00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:40.394
just so we can

1296
00:25:40.394 --> 00:25:41.334
get some more table

1297
00:25:41.334 --> 00:25:43.026
drops here. And let's

1298
00:25:43.026 --> 00:25:44.325
open this up and

1299
00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:45.065
we'll drag and drop

1300
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:46.005
products on the top.

1301
00:25:46.105 --> 00:25:47.065
That was added and

1302
00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:47.464
we don't have to

1303
00:25:47.464 --> 00:25:47.923
keep going on with

1304
00:25:47.923 --> 00:25:48.403
this, right? This is

1305
00:25:48.403 --> 00:25:49.683
simple application level stuff,

1306
00:25:49.884 --> 00:25:50.443
but you can see

1307
00:25:50.443 --> 00:25:52.083
that this feature was

1308
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.143
built into Ant, okay?

1309
00:25:53.143 --> 00:25:54.342
And not only did

1310
00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:55.541
our agent build this

1311
00:25:55.541 --> 00:25:56.741
for us, it proved

1312
00:25:56.741 --> 00:25:57.781
to us that the

1313
00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:58.601
work was done. Here

1314
00:25:58.601 --> 00:26:00.020
are images and you
