884
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.839
this JSON object. We

885
00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:02.059
wanna parse out the

886
00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:03.818
base model, ADWID, and

887
00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:04.877
of course our slash

888
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.876
command that we're going

889
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:06.557
to run. And this

890
00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:06.876
is one of the

891
00:18:06.876 --> 00:18:08.276
first things that runs

892
00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:09.355
in our workflows so

893
00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:10.734
that we can parse

894
00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:11.874
this information out, right?

895
00:18:12.134 --> 00:18:13.053
And so we've encoded

896
00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:14.012
this and you can

897
00:18:14.012 --> 00:18:14.991
see we just use

898
00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:16.111
base or heavy, right?

899
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.570
Super important idea here.

900
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.369
You can encode any

901
00:18:18.369 --> 00:18:19.648
information dense keyword you

902
00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:20.689
want that changes your

903
00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:22.307
workflows, right? And you're

904
00:18:22.307 --> 00:18:23.186
likely gonna wanna pass

905
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:23.866
those in at the

906
00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:25.566
top level to adjust

907
00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:27.217
how your agents operate

908
00:18:27.217 --> 00:18:28.257
a given task or

909
00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:30.076
feature. That's that. Let's
