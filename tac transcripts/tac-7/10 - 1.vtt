219
00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:00.923
schemas. We want support

220
00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:02.083
for better models for

221
00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.382
query generation, all right?

222
00:05:03.382 --> 00:05:03.961
This is a simple

223
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:04.721
one. This is gonna

224
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.161
be a chore and

225
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.242
we want to update

226
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:08.500
our model to use

227
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.940
04 mini, okay? So

228
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.560
we're just boosting our

229
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.521
model. I think currently

230
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:12.281
it's up to GPT

231
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.579
4.1. These are just

232
00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.660
random examples of work

233
00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:15.620
you might be doing

234
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.240
inside of your code

235
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.358
base that you don't

236
00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.278
need to do anymore.

237
00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.819
You can hand out

238
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.598
this work to your

239
00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:20.879
agents, all right? And

240
00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:21.858
last but not least,

241
00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.358
let's solve a bug.

242
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.528
We have a really

243
00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:26.209
simple issue here. If

244
00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:27.487
we open up this

245
00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:28.266
on the server, you

246
00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:28.747
can see here our

247
00:05:28.747 --> 00:05:30.826
