1922
00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:00.476
right? Simple stuff like

1923
00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:02.135
this, front-end changes, database

1924
00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:04.393
migrations, right? Simple, low

1925
00:38:04.393 --> 00:38:05.532
effort, easy to validate,

1926
00:38:05.532 --> 00:38:06.853
easy to test, encode

1927
00:38:06.853 --> 00:38:07.851
your engineering, template your

1928
00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:09.530
engineering, let your agentic

1929
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.190
system, let your ADWs

1930
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.449
prove to you that

1931
00:38:12.449 --> 00:38:12.989
they can do this

1932
00:38:12.989 --> 00:38:14.228
work, right? That's your

1933
00:38:14.248 --> 00:38:15.887
responsibility to encode that

1934
00:38:15.887 --> 00:38:17.148
into the agentic layer.

1935
00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:18.166
Everything starts small, think

1936
00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:19.367
in the gray, but

1937
00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:20.365
once you start down

1938
00:38:20.365 --> 00:38:21.365
this path, you realize

1939
00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.324
something very quickly, it

1940
00:38:22.324 --> 00:38:23.764
will compound. Your first

1941
00:38:23.764 --> 00:38:24.844
agent ships a chore,

1942
00:38:24.884 --> 00:38:25.603
your next agent Agentec

1943
00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.282
workflows, start shipping bugs,

1944
00:38:27.362 --> 00:38:28.402
then features, and then

1945
00:38:28.402 --> 00:38:29.143
they'll do it five

1946
00:38:29.143 --> 00:38:30.163
times and they'll do
