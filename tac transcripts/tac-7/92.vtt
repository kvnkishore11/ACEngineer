2345
00:45:58.704 --> 00:46:00.184
secret of tactical agentic

2346
00:46:00.184 --> 00:46:01.023
coding is that it's

2347
00:46:01.023 --> 00:46:02.244
not about the software

2348
00:46:02.244 --> 00:46:03.702
developer lifecycle at all.

2349
00:46:03.702 --> 00:46:05.822
It's about composable agentic

2350
00:46:05.822 --> 00:46:07.380
primitives you can use

2351
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.199
to solve any engineering

2352
00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.380
problem class. I'm just

2353
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.119
gonna say that again.

2354
00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:12.398
The secret of tactical

2355
00:46:12.398 --> 00:46:13.659
agentic coding is that

2356
00:46:13.659 --> 00:46:14.518
it's not about the

2357
00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:16.438
software developer lifecycle at

2358
00:46:16.438 --> 00:46:18.336
all. It's about composable

2359
00:46:18.416 --> 00:46:19.916
agentic primitives you can

2360
00:46:19.916 --> 00:46:21.755
use to solve any

2361
00:46:21.755 --> 00:46:23.594
engineering problem class. The

2362
00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:25.074
software developer lifecycle is

2363
00:46:25.074 --> 00:46:26.034
powerful, but it's a

2364
00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:27.313
remnant of the past.

2365
00:46:27.353 --> 00:46:28.373
It's been very powerful.

2366
00:46:28.393 --> 00:46:29.672
It's still very relevant.

2367
00:46:29.873 --> 00:46:30.693
It's something that we
