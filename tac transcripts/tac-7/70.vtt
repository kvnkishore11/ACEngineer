Zero Touch Engineering, ISO,

1759
00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:04.088
update, light green, Let's

1760
00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:05.148
just say your designer

1761
00:35:05.148 --> 00:35:05.969
is having a bad

1762
00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:06.887
day, whatever, they wanna

1763
00:35:06.907 --> 00:35:08.646
update some random styling.

1764
00:35:08.646 --> 00:35:10.447
They've decided that glass

1765
00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:11.206
is the new big

1766
00:35:11.226 --> 00:35:12.505
thing or whatever UI

1767
00:35:12.505 --> 00:35:13.144
is the next big

1768
00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:13.985
thing, right? This is

1769
00:35:13.985 --> 00:35:14.764
not something you should

1770
00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:15.864
ever spend your time

1771
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:16.603
on, right? This is

1772
00:35:16.603 --> 00:35:18.302
not engineering. So hand

1773
00:35:18.302 --> 00:35:18.663
it off to your

1774
00:35:18.663 --> 00:35:19.661
agents, right? This is

1775
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:20.742
low hanging fruit. Your

1776
00:35:20.742 --> 00:35:21.240
agent should be able

1777
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.021
to ship this end

1778
00:35:22.021 --> 00:35:22.501
to end. Let's kick

1779
00:35:22.541 --> 00:35:23.320
this off and let's

1780
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.219
get a ZTE execution.

1781
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:25.898
In a couple seconds

1782
00:35:25.898 --> 00:35:26.659
here, we're gonna get

1783
00:35:26.659 --> 00:35:27.838
our initiation. Just gonna

1784
00:35:27.838 --> 00:35:28.918
detect that this is

1785
00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:29.916
a zero touch engineering

1786
00:35:29.916 --> 00:35:30.896
workflow. And you can
