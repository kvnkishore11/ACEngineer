1486
00:29:29.493 --> 00:29:30.153
you want to be

1487
00:29:30.153 --> 00:29:31.093
ahead of this curve,

1488
00:29:31.093 --> 00:29:31.692
right? You want to

1489
00:29:31.692 --> 00:29:32.792
be pushing forward, lean

1490
00:29:32.792 --> 00:29:34.612
into this, okay? You

1491
00:29:34.612 --> 00:29:35.510
want to get these

1492
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.810
gains before anyone else

1493
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.589
does, right? This is

1494
00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:39.648
technology. It always gets

1495
00:29:39.648 --> 00:29:41.088
distributed, right? But you

1496
00:29:41.088 --> 00:29:41.587
want to be at

1497
00:29:41.587 --> 00:29:42.347
the edge so that

1498
00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:42.748
you can get the

1499
00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:43.727
gains as long as

1500
00:29:43.727 --> 00:29:44.987
possible, right? I'm giving

1501
00:29:44.987 --> 00:29:47.125
you an information arbitrage,

1502
00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:48.125
okay? You have an

1503
00:29:48.144 --> 00:29:49.325
information edge now. And

1504
00:29:49.325 --> 00:29:49.924
then the question is,

1505
00:29:49.924 --> 00:29:50.403
are you going to

1506
00:29:50.403 --> 00:29:51.743
use it? to invest

1507
00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:52.923
in the agentic layer,

1508
00:29:53.123 --> 00:29:53.782
right? This is what

1509
00:29:53.782 --> 00:29:54.782
it all comes down

1510
00:29:54.782 --> 00:29:55.942
to, okay? This is

1511
00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:57.382
ultra, ultra important stuff.

1512
00:29:57.481 --> 00:29:58.941
So the next natural

1513
00:29:58.941 --> 00:30:00.961
question is, right? It's
