524
00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:00.307
work done. This is

525
00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:01.826
just a full recap

526
00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:03.206
of everything we've done

527
00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:04.565
up to this lesson,

528
00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:06.663
right? Now, the interesting

529
00:11:06.663 --> 00:11:07.263
part here is how

530
00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:08.861
we've scaled this up.

531
00:11:08.994 --> 00:11:10.432
Before, as you'll remember,

532
00:11:10.432 --> 00:11:11.673
our agent box was

533
00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:14.351
limited to strictly operating

534
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:15.770
in the base directory,

535
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:16.850
but now we've used

536
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.690
Git work trees. And

537
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.389
it doesn't matter that

538
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.989
you use Git work

539
00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:21.568
trees. It doesn't matter

540
00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:22.067
if you want to

541
00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:24.506
use individual instances, individual

542
00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:26.427
VMs, Docker containers. I

543
00:11:26.427 --> 00:11:27.105
don't care how you

544
00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:28.409
scale up your agent

545
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:30.187
environments, it only matters
