00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:00.683
Some in loop review.

1147
00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:01.624
Okay. So this is

1148
00:23:01.624 --> 00:23:02.423
still going to happen.

1149
00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:03.163
As much as I'm

1150
00:23:03.303 --> 00:23:04.982
pushing and advising you

1151
00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:05.502
to go out the

1152
00:23:05.502 --> 00:23:06.221
loop, right? You want

1153
00:23:06.241 --> 00:23:07.021
to stay out the

1154
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:08.362
loop. I understand that

1155
00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:09.401
it's important to keep

1156
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:10.421
in mind. Engineering is

1157
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:11.181
not black and white.

1158
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.839
It's gray. You progress

1159
00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:13.700
toward the next thing,

1160
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.240
right? You progress toward

1161
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.878
Agentic Engineering. You progress

1162
00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:18.759
toward using tactics of

1163
00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:20.137
agentic coding one day

1164
00:23:20.137 --> 00:23:21.230
at a time. Right?

1165
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.829
It's not black and

1166
00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:22.589
white. Okay. It's not

1167
00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:23.170
that simple. It's not

1168
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.249
that stupid, right? What

1169
00:23:24.249 --> 00:23:24.828
we're doing here is

1170
00:23:24.828 --> 00:23:26.229
quite complex. And so

1171
00:23:26.229 --> 00:23:26.788
what we're going to

1172
00:23:26.788 --> 00:23:28.189
do here is go

1173
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:29.028
in the loop and

1174
00:23:29.028 --> 00:23:29.748
review this code. All

1175
00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:30.928
right. So our agents
