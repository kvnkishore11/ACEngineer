92
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:31.347
of course, document asks,

93
00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:32.506
how does it work?

94
00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.283
Notice testing answers the

95
00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:35.782
question, does it work?

96
00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:37.161
But review answers the

97
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.560
question, is what we

98
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.179
built what we asked

99
00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.717
for? So by reviewing,

100
00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:42.776
we're not talking about

101
00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:44.335
code quality or implementation

102
00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:45.693
details. We're handing all

103
00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:46.193
that off to our

104
00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:47.352
agents. We're asking a

105
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:49.310
specific set of agents

106
00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:51.616
trained to review this

107
00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.256
question is what was

108
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.695
built what we asked

109
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:56.275
for now prove it

110
00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:57.394
the question and the

111
00:02:57.394 --> 00:02:58.813
answer is essential this

112
00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:00.013
is key for increasing
