936
00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:00.378
And we of course

937
00:19:00.378 --> 00:19:01.398
have a PR so

938
00:19:01.398 --> 00:19:02.258
we can open this

939
00:19:02.258 --> 00:19:03.876
PR up here. 100

940
00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:04.817
lines change here. This

941
00:19:04.817 --> 00:19:06.016
is a simple change.

942
00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:06.895
Let's see what we

943
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.834
changed here. Our conditional

944
00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:10.534
docs, of course, agentically

945
00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:11.673
was updated. You can

946
00:19:11.673 --> 00:19:12.393
see there's that key

947
00:19:12.393 --> 00:19:15.011
change, LLM processor. Our

948
00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:15.911
model is getting bumped.

949
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.090
It's getting bumped there.

950
00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:17.789
So wherever we're calling

951
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:18.690
our OpenAI model, it's

952
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.989
getting bumped. Our tests

953
00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:21.068
have updated. So we

954
00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:22.028
have a nice set

955
00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:23.188
of documentation here. We're

956
00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:25.067
referencing the original plan,

957
00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:26.526
right? We have documentation

958
00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:26.885
and we have the

959
00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:27.526
plan. So we have

960
00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:28.785
both ends of the

961
00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:30.105
software developer lifecycle. We
