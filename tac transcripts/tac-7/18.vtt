WEBVTT

421
00:08:59.528 --> 00:09:02.126
have SDLC ZTE ISO.

422
00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:02.787
We're gonna break that

423
00:09:02.787 --> 00:09:03.765
down later on in

424
00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:04.826
this lesson. Let's focus

425
00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:05.745
on that last additional

426
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:06.705
piece. We have ADW

427
00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:08.464
Ship ISO. Let's focus

428
00:09:08.484 --> 00:09:09.763
in on the key

429
00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:10.523
piece here. We have

430
00:09:10.602 --> 00:09:12.442
end to end agents

431
00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:13.301
shipping work on our

432
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:14.679
behalf the way we

433
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.580
would. So let's open

434
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.318
this file up. And

435
00:09:16.318 --> 00:09:16.979
as you know, the

436
00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:18.097
ADW directory is a

437
00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:19.876
scripting layer that lets

438
00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:21.615
us construct pipelines of

439
00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:23.534
agents that solve specific

440
00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:25.432
classes of problems back

441
00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:26.513
to back to back.

442
00:09:26.773 --> 00:09:27.672
Okay. Not all of

443
00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:28.192
our workflows are going

444
00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.331
to work perfectly end

445
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.470
to end and that's
