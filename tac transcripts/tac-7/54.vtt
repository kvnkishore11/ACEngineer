WEBVTT

1366
00:26:59.943 --> 00:27:01.403
right? We have artifacts,

1367
00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:02.303
right? We have artifacts

1368
00:27:02.303 --> 00:27:03.942
for agents. Okay. When

1369
00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:04.662
you combine all of

1370
00:27:04.662 --> 00:27:06.060
this with the conditional

1371
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.740
docs, we of course

1372
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.640
have our brand new

1373
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.278
feature enhanced drop zone

1374
00:27:10.398 --> 00:27:11.998
updated in our conditional

1375
00:27:11.998 --> 00:27:13.238
documentation. So now when

1376
00:27:13.238 --> 00:27:14.436
our next agent runs,

1377
00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:15.856
it knows that when

1378
00:27:15.856 --> 00:27:16.875
it works with drag

1379
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:17.875
and drop implementing file

1380
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.535
upload, troubleshooting, blah, blah,

1381
00:27:19.535 --> 00:27:20.275
blah, right? It knows

1382
00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:20.874
that when it hits

1383
00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:21.854
one of these conditions,

1384
00:27:22.082 --> 00:27:23.201
Pull in this documentation.

1385
00:27:23.201 --> 00:27:24.119
This lets our agents

1386
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.239
scale with the size

1387
00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:26.057
of our codebase.

1388
00:27:26.117 --> 00:27:26.616
Pull in the right

1389
00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:27.576
documentation when it needs

1390
00:27:27.576 --> 00:27:28.615
to. Focus on building

1391
00:27:28.615 --> 00:27:29.375
the right thing when

1392
00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:30.074
it needs to. And
