909
00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:30.076
feature. That's that. Let's

910
00:18:30.096 --> 00:18:30.934
see how we're doing

911
00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:31.934
here now. Okay, so

912
00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:33.054
we're still implementing. This

913
00:18:33.054 --> 00:18:34.153
is a heavy feature

914
00:18:34.153 --> 00:18:34.853
and we are running

915
00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:36.112
heavy models, right? So

916
00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:36.771
this will take some

917
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:37.431
time. Looks like we're

918
00:18:37.431 --> 00:18:38.250
11 minutes in right

919
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.250
now. Let's continue to

920
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.470
our other features. See

921
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.788
how we're doing. SDLC,

922
00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:42.948
updating model. We wanna

923
00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:43.948
use that 04 many

924
00:18:43.948 --> 00:18:45.946
for our SQL natural

925
00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:47.945
language generation functionality. So

926
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:48.346
let's go over to

927
00:18:48.346 --> 00:18:49.424
the bottom here. Awesome,

928
00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:50.204
so check this out.

929
00:18:50.204 --> 00:18:51.324
Six minutes ago, this

930
00:18:51.324 --> 00:18:53.182
feature completed. Let's scroll

931
00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:53.942
up to our review.

932
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:55.201
This looks good. All

933
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.780
tests passed. We updated

934
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.500
from 4.1, 04 many,

935
00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.599
it looks great. Fantastic.

936
00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:00.378
And we of course
