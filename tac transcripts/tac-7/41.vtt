1016
00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:30.872
leave to know that

1017
00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:31.891
your agents have shipped

1018
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:32.651
the work end to

1019
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:33.750
end. Here, we're just

1020
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.809
using, you know, GitHub

1021
00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:35.970
issues. We're posting literally

1022
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.528
right back to the

1023
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:37.808
issue that kicked off

1024
00:20:37.828 --> 00:20:38.768
the workflow. A lot

1025
00:20:38.768 --> 00:20:39.347
of engineers, you know,

1026
00:20:39.347 --> 00:20:39.907
you're going to want

1027
00:20:39.928 --> 00:20:40.307
to look at the

1028
00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:41.467
pull request. You're going

1029
00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:42.247
to want to push

1030
00:20:42.247 --> 00:20:43.526
content information to the

1031
00:20:43.526 --> 00:20:44.625
pull request. I do

1032
00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:45.625
think that this is

1033
00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:47.324
an entire product category

1034
00:20:47.384 --> 00:20:48.104
that is important to

1035
00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:49.103
build out. Having a

1036
00:20:49.143 --> 00:20:50.742
comprehensive review system is

1037
00:20:50.742 --> 00:20:52.261
a massive, massive edge

1038
00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:53.622
for increasing your review

1039
00:20:53.622 --> 00:20:55.000
velocity. Right here, you

1040
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.601
can see, you know,

1041
00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:56.920
throughout tech, we're keeping

1042
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.259
it simple. We're showcasing

1043
00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:00.419
concepts, ideas, tactics, right?
