2112
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.760
what? You might be

2113
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.519
right, but it's not

2114
00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:32.418
about being right. It's

2115
00:41:32.418 --> 00:41:33.539
about being prepared to

2116
00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:35.097
win. It's about thinking

2117
00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:35.978
in the gray so

2118
00:41:35.978 --> 00:41:36.498
that you can get

2119
00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:37.777
the gains as soon

2120
00:41:37.777 --> 00:41:38.697
as they're available. This

2121
00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:39.255
is not a black

2122
00:41:39.255 --> 00:41:40.056
and white thing. It's

2123
00:41:40.056 --> 00:41:40.755
not on and off.

2124
00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:42.394
It's progression. It's improvement.

2125
00:41:42.394 --> 00:41:43.634
It's iteration. You know

2126
00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:44.713
this. You're an engineer.

2127
00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:46.132
So hopefully that monologue

2128
00:41:46.132 --> 00:41:47.012
was useful for you.

2129
00:41:47.193 --> 00:41:48.052
Let's come full circle

2130
00:41:48.052 --> 00:41:48.952
here. If you do

2131
00:41:48.952 --> 00:41:50.010
all this, if you

2132
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:50.971
ride this curve, if

2133
00:41:50.971 --> 00:41:51.969
you even get to

2134
00:41:51.989 --> 00:41:53.090
out loop, right? And

2135
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.929
you start progressing towards

2136
00:41:53.949 --> 00:41:54.708
zero touch engineering, I

2137
00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:55.449
promise you, if you

2138
00:41:55.449 --> 00:41:56.367
do this right, you

2139
00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:57.007
will be the engineer

2140
00:41:57.007 --> 00:41:58.567
engineer they can't replace.

2141
00:41:58.586 --> 00:41:59.487
Why is that? It's

2142
00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:00.945
because you understand and
