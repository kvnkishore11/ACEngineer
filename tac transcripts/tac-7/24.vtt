571
00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:00.568
see here in plan

572
00:12:00.668 --> 00:12:01.649
ISO, right? When we're

573
00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:02.687
planning our work, setting

574
00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:03.947
up the environment, we

575
00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:05.868
run slash install work

576
00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:06.447
tree. And then we're

577
00:12:06.447 --> 00:12:07.807
passing in our ports

578
00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:08.826
that were created and

579
00:12:08.826 --> 00:12:09.706
our work tree path.

580
00:12:09.706 --> 00:12:10.346
And then you can

581
00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:11.426
imagine what this does,

582
00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:13.317
the work tree, sets

583
00:12:13.317 --> 00:12:14.476
up every piece that

584
00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:15.697
we need to operate

585
00:12:15.697 --> 00:12:16.316
the codebase in

586
00:12:16.316 --> 00:12:17.615
a dedicated directory, right?

587
00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:18.735
So we're basically cloning

588
00:12:18.735 --> 00:12:20.034
in a new version.

589
00:12:20.034 --> 00:12:21.173
We're installing as if

590
00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:22.173
we, the engineer, were

591
00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:23.293
operating, right? This is

592
00:12:23.293 --> 00:12:24.273
critical. Some type of

593
00:12:24.273 --> 00:12:25.631
configuration format like this

594
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:26.072
is going to be

595
00:12:26.072 --> 00:12:27.150
really important. A lot

596
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.931
of engineers, you're going

597
00:12:27.931 --> 00:12:28.730
to lean on tools

598
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.929
like Docker, some new
