1202
00:23:59.407 --> 00:24:01.126
gonna stop that. And

1203
00:24:01.307 --> 00:24:01.906
now I'm gonna run

1204
00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:03.125
a new prompt in

1205
00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:04.605
loop review. All we

1206
00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:05.744
do here is pass

1207
00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:07.644
in our branch, pop

1208
00:24:07.644 --> 00:24:08.963
the branch name, pass

1209
00:24:08.963 --> 00:24:10.022
this in and our

1210
00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:10.623
in loop review. Of

1211
00:24:10.623 --> 00:24:11.442
course, you can always

1212
00:24:11.442 --> 00:24:12.201
just look at what

1213
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.182
the prompt is doing.

1214
00:24:13.346 --> 00:24:14.164
and the preview, you

1215
00:24:14.164 --> 00:24:14.605
can see here, it's

1216
00:24:14.605 --> 00:24:15.604
nice and simple, right?

1217
00:24:16.084 --> 00:24:17.123
Pull the branch, grab

1218
00:24:17.123 --> 00:24:18.942
the changes, reset our

1219
00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:20.800
database, restart the application,

1220
00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:22.239
let's review, right? So

1221
00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:23.118
this is super simple.

1222
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:23.938
We can even, you

1223
00:24:23.938 --> 00:24:24.837
know, check out back

1224
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:26.455
to main and reset

1225
00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:27.256
when we're done here,

1226
00:24:27.276 --> 00:24:27.974
right? So you can

1227
00:24:27.974 --> 00:24:28.694
see we are on

1228
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.125
that new branch. And
