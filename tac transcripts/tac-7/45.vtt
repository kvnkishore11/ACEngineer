1119
00:22:29.117 --> 00:22:30.596
our random data is

1120
00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:31.955
still implementing. This is

1121
00:22:31.955 --> 00:22:33.056
a big feature, it's

1122
00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:34.154
running Opus. This is

1123
00:22:34.154 --> 00:22:34.875
gonna be the ones

1124
00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:35.794
where we might have

1125
00:22:35.794 --> 00:22:36.753
to jump in, right?

1126
00:22:36.753 --> 00:22:37.853
Go from Outloop to

1127
00:22:37.853 --> 00:22:38.732
Endloop to kind of

1128
00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:39.932
round out the implementation

1129
00:22:39.932 --> 00:22:40.852
or understand what's going

1130
00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:42.490
on. Our increase drop

1131
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.631
zone surface area has

1132
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:45.849
completed. This is fantastic.

1133
00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:46.788
So all the work

1134
00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:48.308
here is done and

1135
00:22:48.328 --> 00:22:49.127
that means that we

1136
00:22:49.127 --> 00:22:49.827
can check out the

1137
00:22:49.827 --> 00:22:50.787
PR. So let's go

1138
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:51.467
ahead and open up

1139
00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:52.406
this PR. I'm going

1140
00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:53.826
to copy the branch

1141
00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:54.566
Looks like we have

1142
00:22:54.566 --> 00:22:55.726
400 lines here. That's

1143
00:22:55.726 --> 00:22:56.884
great. And now we're

1144
00:22:56.884 --> 00:22:58.065
going to do some

1145
00:22:58.065 --> 00:22:59.163
hands on review, right?

1146
00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:00.683
Some in loop review.
