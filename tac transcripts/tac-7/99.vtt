2506
00:49:28.648 --> 00:49:30.028
coding. All right, so

2507
00:49:30.048 --> 00:49:31.967
what happens next? Take

2508
00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:32.628
a moment to just

2509
00:49:32.628 --> 00:49:33.608
appreciate what we've done

2510
00:49:33.608 --> 00:49:35.268
here. We have seen

2511
00:49:35.268 --> 00:49:36.367
the future of where

2512
00:49:36.367 --> 00:49:37.027
this is all going,

2513
00:49:37.027 --> 00:49:38.367
right? We've transcended the

2514
00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:40.465
traditional engineering velocity scale

2515
00:49:40.505 --> 00:49:42.077
in loop, Outloop zero

2516
00:49:42.077 --> 00:49:43.336
touch coding. You understand

2517
00:49:43.336 --> 00:49:44.677
that the agent layer

2518
00:49:44.677 --> 00:49:46.097
is the highest leverage

2519
00:49:46.097 --> 00:49:46.815
point in your code

2520
00:49:46.815 --> 00:49:47.396
base. This is the

2521
00:49:47.396 --> 00:49:48.556
place where one X

2522
00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:49.894
input becomes 10 X

2523
00:49:49.894 --> 00:49:50.954
output and 10 X

2524
00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.614
input becomes 100 X

2525
00:49:52.655 --> 00:49:53.793
if you invest in

2526
00:49:53.793 --> 00:49:55.329
this layer, okay? everything

2527
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:56.349
I've shown you, everything

2528
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:57.268
we've worked through in

2529
00:49:57.268 --> 00:49:58.188
TAC so far, the

2530
00:49:58.188 --> 00:49:59.588
plan, build, test, review,

2531
00:49:59.588 --> 00:50:00.708
and document is just
