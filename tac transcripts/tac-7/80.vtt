00:39:58.914 --> 00:40:00.014
hit enter and ship

2031
00:40:00.014 --> 00:40:01.592
into production. Zero touch

2032
00:40:01.592 --> 00:40:02.753
engineering. 90% of the

2033
00:40:02.753 --> 00:40:03.793
time, there's no issues.

2034
00:40:03.793 --> 00:40:04.733
And that number keeps

2035
00:40:04.733 --> 00:40:06.132
going up. Every tool

2036
00:40:06.132 --> 00:40:07.612
release, every model release,

2037
00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:08.811
every time they improve

2038
00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:10.090
their organic layer. Okay.

2039
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.110
Now imagine the other

2040
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.469
scenario. Let's say you're

2041
00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:13.409
standing still or you're

2042
00:40:13.409 --> 00:40:14.590
moving away, right? Say

2043
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.489
you're running away. You

2044
00:40:15.489 --> 00:40:16.349
open up the terminal,

2045
00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:17.309
you look at JIRA,

2046
00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:17.989
right? You look at

2047
00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:19.369
your task management tool,

2048
00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:20.088
you pull it up

2049
00:40:20.088 --> 00:40:21.967
in your in-loop IDE.

2050
00:40:22.027 --> 00:40:23.108
Hopefully you're using cloud

2051
00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:23.806
code, but if you're

2052
00:40:23.806 --> 00:40:24.327
not on board with

2053
00:40:24.327 --> 00:40:24.867
some of these ideas,

2054
00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:26.206
you're probably maybe not

2055
00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:27.246
even using it, right?

2056
00:40:27.246 --> 00:40:27.806
Maybe you don't use

2057
00:40:27.806 --> 00:40:28.724
an agent at all.

2058
00:40:28.784 --> 00:40:29.545
You write the prompt,

2059
00:40:29.545 --> 00:40:30.405
you sit, you wait,
