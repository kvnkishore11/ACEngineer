986
00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:00.645
the power of the

987
00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:01.546
Outloop system. This is

988
00:20:01.546 --> 00:20:03.164
the power of investing

989
00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:04.903
in your agentic layer

990
00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:05.784
of your codebase.

991
00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.202
This is where scaled

992
00:20:07.303 --> 00:20:09.041
up agentic impact happens.

993
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.461
Now, many engineers are

994
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:11.141
going to gloss over

995
00:20:11.141 --> 00:20:11.941
this. They're not going

996
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.480
to pay attention to

997
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.220
this. They're going to

998
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.720
stay in the loop

999
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.200
and they're going to

1000
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.878
waste a bunch of

1001
00:20:14.878 --> 00:20:15.919
time. Not you and

1002
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:17.317
I. CSV text doesn't

1003
00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:18.298
match. This is a

1004
00:20:18.298 --> 00:20:19.217
simple patch workflow. It

1005
00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:20.017
looks like this completed

1006
00:20:20.017 --> 00:20:21.276
a while ago. Great.

1007
00:20:21.296 --> 00:20:21.955
So you do want

1008
00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:22.796
to stay on the

1009
00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:23.835
review system as much

1010
00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:24.595
as possible, right? You

1011
00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:25.075
want to build up

1012
00:20:25.075 --> 00:20:26.034
your review system to

1013
00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:27.633
be intricate, to be

1014
00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:28.913
detailed so that basically

1015
00:20:28.913 --> 00:20:29.653
you don't have to

1016
00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:30.872
leave to know that
