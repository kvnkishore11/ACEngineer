1175
00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:30.928
right. So our agents

1176
00:23:30.928 --> 00:23:32.067
have proved to us

1177
00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:33.008
that this feature is

1178
00:23:33.008 --> 00:23:34.188
built. The review step

1179
00:23:34.188 --> 00:23:35.107
is super, super critical

1180
00:23:35.107 --> 00:23:36.127
for this. Remember we

1181
00:23:36.127 --> 00:23:37.467
have this concrete review.

1182
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:38.067
So our agents have

1183
00:23:38.067 --> 00:23:38.987
proven to us that

1184
00:23:38.987 --> 00:23:40.106
this works, but you

1185
00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:40.987
know, we're engineers, we're

1186
00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:42.546
skeptical. We're getting used

1187
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.425
to this. Our installation

1188
00:23:44.425 --> 00:23:45.794
has worked. We do

1189
00:23:45.794 --> 00:23:47.232
need to reset the

1190
00:23:47.232 --> 00:23:48.093
origin. So of course

1191
00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:48.673
I'm gonna do that

1192
00:23:48.673 --> 00:23:50.132
real quick here. Set

1193
00:23:50.152 --> 00:23:51.651
origin back to tag

1194
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:53.050
seven. Of course, you

1195
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:53.650
will create a new

1196
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.250
codebase so that

1197
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.230
you have access to

1198
00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:56.989
a full GitHub repository

1199
00:23:56.989 --> 00:23:57.689
codebase, but I'm

1200
00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:58.208
just gonna do this

1201
00:23:58.208 --> 00:23:59.407
here. Fantastic. Now I'm

1202
00:23:59.407 --> 00:24:01.126
gonna stop that. And
