2236
00:43:59.851 --> 00:44:01.449
of Tactical Agentic Coding,

2237
00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:02.509
let's just review our

2238
00:44:02.509 --> 00:44:03.827
Zero Touch Engineering workflow

2239
00:44:03.827 --> 00:44:05.186
here. It should almost

2240
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:06.025
be shipped by now.

2241
00:44:06.025 --> 00:44:06.744
This is a simple

2242
00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:07.844
feature. We're on the

2243
00:44:07.844 --> 00:44:09.483
documentation step, so we're

2244
00:44:09.483 --> 00:44:10.653
almost there. You can

2245
00:44:10.653 --> 00:44:11.913
see here, once again,

2246
00:44:12.012 --> 00:44:12.873
our engineering has been

2247
00:44:12.873 --> 00:44:14.492
encoded. We have screenshots

2248
00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:15.670
in our review phase,

2249
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:16.490
in our review step.

2250
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.731
Background is green, right?

2251
00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:19.050
Super, super simple, right?

2252
00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:20.648
There's the validation one

2253
00:44:20.648 --> 00:44:21.728
minute ago. Our agents

2254
00:44:21.728 --> 00:44:22.648
are working for us.

2255
00:44:22.648 --> 00:44:23.668
They're validating their work.

2256
00:44:23.688 --> 00:44:24.467
This is a great

2257
00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:25.427
example of something you

2258
00:44:25.427 --> 00:44:26.347
can just ship to

2259
00:44:26.347 --> 00:44:27.826
prod. There is no

2260
00:44:27.826 --> 00:44:29.005
value in me doing

2261
00:44:29.005 --> 00:44:30.125
this, right? There is
