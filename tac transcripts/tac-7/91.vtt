2318
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:30.606
add another step on

2319
00:45:30.606 --> 00:45:32.083
the software developer lifecycle.

2320
00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:33.161
Maybe you've add that

2321
00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:34.878
key deploy check step,

2322
00:45:34.878 --> 00:45:36.177
bunch of deterministic deploy

2323
00:45:36.177 --> 00:45:37.155
checks, whatever you want

2324
00:45:37.175 --> 00:45:37.793
to do. Maybe you

2325
00:45:37.793 --> 00:45:39.052
go super hard on

2326
00:45:39.052 --> 00:45:40.353
your review step. Maybe

2327
00:45:40.353 --> 00:45:41.193
you add video to

2328
00:45:41.193 --> 00:45:42.353
review. Maybe you add

2329
00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:43.811
double agent check, right?

2330
00:45:43.811 --> 00:45:45.291
Maybe you parallelize the

2331
00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:46.391
review step so that

2332
00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:47.251
three agents have to

2333
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:48.570
say, three pipelines of

2334
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.230
agents have to say,

2335
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.889
this is right. You

2336
00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:50.688
can run the fusion

2337
00:45:50.688 --> 00:45:52.068
chain on agents. Okay,

2338
00:45:52.068 --> 00:45:53.007
it doesn't matter, right?

2339
00:45:53.007 --> 00:45:53.708
It really doesn't matter.

2340
00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:54.586
And this leads us

2341
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:55.507
to the secret of

2342
00:45:55.507 --> 00:45:57.186
Tactical Agentic Coding. This

2343
00:45:57.186 --> 00:45:57.905
is what everything's been

2344
00:45:57.905 --> 00:45:58.704
building up to. The

2345
00:45:58.704 --> 00:46:00.184
secret of tactical agentic
