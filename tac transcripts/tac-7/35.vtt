858
00:17:28.992 --> 00:17:30.012
you know, all over.

859
00:17:30.393 --> 00:17:30.853
If we just do

860
00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:31.792
a search for this

861
00:17:31.813 --> 00:17:32.272
inside of all of

862
00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:33.192
our prompts, this is

863
00:17:33.192 --> 00:17:34.451
important for activating your

864
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.291
reasoning model. So we

865
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:36.751
are scaling our compute

866
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:37.551
there, but we have

867
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:38.832
an additional knob here

868
00:17:38.832 --> 00:17:39.711
to scale it again.

869
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:40.871
So if we pass

870
00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:41.951
in heavy and the

871
00:17:41.951 --> 00:17:42.971
workflow that detects this

872
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:43.631
is going to be

873
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:45.550
our classify ADW, right?

874
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.270
And again, if you're

875
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.411
ever wondering where this

876
00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:48.609
stuff runs, you can

877
00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:50.069
always just type slash

878
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.032
classify ADW. Okay, and

879
00:17:52.032 --> 00:17:52.892
so it runs right

880
00:17:52.892 --> 00:17:54.410
here, workflow operations, where

881
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.907
we classify the ADW

882
00:17:55.907 --> 00:17:56.967
at the beginning of

883
00:17:56.967 --> 00:17:59.080
the workflow. To obtain

884
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.839
this JSON object. We
