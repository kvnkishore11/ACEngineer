1094
00:21:59.628 --> 00:22:00.208
we asked for in

1095
00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:01.127
the prompt. Drag and

1096
00:22:01.147 --> 00:22:02.688
drop over any block

1097
00:22:02.948 --> 00:22:04.327
that exists, right? Drag

1098
00:22:04.327 --> 00:22:05.527
and drop feature has

1099
00:22:05.527 --> 00:22:06.686
almost been completed. So

1100
00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:07.487
remember, we fired this

1101
00:22:07.487 --> 00:22:08.826
off 27 minutes ago,

1102
00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:09.686
and I wonder how

1103
00:22:09.686 --> 00:22:10.426
much code we're gonna

1104
00:22:10.426 --> 00:22:11.486
get here generated for

1105
00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:12.326
us by our agents,

1106
00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:14.365
maybe two, 300 lines.

1107
00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:15.746
Yeah, nice, 300 lines.

1108
00:22:15.806 --> 00:22:16.924
Okay, fantastic. That looks

1109
00:22:16.924 --> 00:22:17.865
great. And so our

1110
00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:19.624
other agent here, add.json

1111
00:22:19.624 --> 00:22:20.584
export, looks like it's

1112
00:22:20.683 --> 00:22:22.503
working through the review.

1113
00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:23.363
Looks like it found

1114
00:22:23.363 --> 00:22:24.682
a blocking issue during

1115
00:22:24.682 --> 00:22:25.623
the review phase. So

1116
00:22:25.623 --> 00:22:26.362
now it's going to

1117
00:22:26.402 --> 00:22:27.162
try to fix this,

1118
00:22:27.182 --> 00:22:28.897
so that's great. And

1119
00:22:29.117 --> 00:22:30.596
our random data is
