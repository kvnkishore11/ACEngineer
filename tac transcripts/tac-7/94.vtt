2389
00:46:59.237 --> 00:47:00.576
test, review, document. But

2390
00:47:00.576 --> 00:47:01.795
my point here is,

2391
00:47:01.815 --> 00:47:02.713
it's not about these

2392
00:47:02.713 --> 00:47:03.893
steps. It's not about

2393
00:47:03.893 --> 00:47:05.192
the software developer lifecycle.

2394
00:47:05.192 --> 00:47:06.150
What we've done here

2395
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:07.608
is, throughout Tactical Agent

2396
00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:09.047
Decoding, the key has

2397
00:47:09.047 --> 00:47:10.186
been showing off how

2398
00:47:10.186 --> 00:47:11.385
you can use and

2399
00:47:11.385 --> 00:47:13.284
compose the new fundamental

2400
00:47:13.284 --> 00:47:14.405
units of engineering to

2401
00:47:14.405 --> 00:47:16.463
solve problem classes, right?

2402
00:47:16.463 --> 00:47:17.963
Sets of problems. We're

2403
00:47:17.963 --> 00:47:19.181
not solving one-off problems

2404
00:47:19.181 --> 00:47:20.161
anymore. All we've been

2405
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:21.860
doing is showcasing what

2406
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.119
this could look like

2407
00:47:23.179 --> 00:47:24.559
inside of the agentic

2408
00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:25.318
layer of your code

2409
00:47:25.318 --> 00:47:26.838
base, okay? Let me

2410
00:47:26.838 --> 00:47:27.918
be super clear. I'm

2411
00:47:27.918 --> 00:47:29.217
saying that this arrangement

2412
00:47:29.318 --> 00:47:31.695
of ADWs is completely
