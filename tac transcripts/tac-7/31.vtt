753
00:15:29.744 --> 00:15:30.644
about our drag and

754
00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.923
drop? Looks like we

755
00:15:31.923 --> 00:15:33.942
are isolated implementation phase

756
00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:35.222
complete. Nice tests have

757
00:15:35.222 --> 00:15:37.302
all passed. Fantastic. Final

758
00:15:37.302 --> 00:15:38.897
test. So we're probably

759
00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.135
reviewing now. Yep. Okay,

760
00:15:40.135 --> 00:15:41.875
great. Also reviewing here.

761
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.094
Here's our table random

762
00:15:43.094 --> 00:15:44.631
data generation feature and

763
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:46.150
more mid-level prompt here.

764
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:46.789
And we're using the

765
00:15:46.789 --> 00:15:47.769
heavy model set. This

766
00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:48.748
is important. Let's talk

767
00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:49.368
about the heavy model

768
00:15:49.368 --> 00:15:50.106
set for a second.

769
00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:50.926
If I scroll down

770
00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:52.044
here, it is okay.

771
00:15:52.044 --> 00:15:53.443
Implementing the solution. This

772
00:15:53.443 --> 00:15:54.222
is probably the largest

773
00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:55.062
feature that we're shipping

774
00:15:55.062 --> 00:15:56.182
right now or that

775
00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:57.221
our agents are shipping

776
00:15:57.221 --> 00:15:57.980
for us right now.

777
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.278
Let's go ahead and

778
00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:00.337
understand what model set
