2003
00:39:29.646 --> 00:39:30.766
builds a system. This

2004
00:39:30.766 --> 00:39:31.844
gets you to an

2005
00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:33.144
incredible place. And this

2006
00:39:33.144 --> 00:39:34.023
is like a simple,

2007
00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:35.684
simple comparison, right? Imagine

2008
00:39:35.684 --> 00:39:36.902
an engineer that runs

2009
00:39:36.902 --> 00:39:37.902
toward the future, right?

2010
00:39:37.902 --> 00:39:39.041
They set up agents

2011
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:39.581
in the codebase

2012
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:41.320
to solve problem classes.

2013
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:41.740
At the end of

2014
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.440
the day, a couple

2015
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.059
of weeks, maybe a

2016
00:39:43.059 --> 00:39:44.320
month of investment, right?

2017
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.378
Probably not. You probably

2018
00:39:45.378 --> 00:39:46.018
don't need that. But,

2019
00:39:46.018 --> 00:39:46.559
you know, let's say

2020
00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:47.478
a week to a

2021
00:39:47.478 --> 00:39:48.916
few weeks of investing

2022
00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:50.036
in your agent declare.

2023
00:39:50.077 --> 00:39:51.195
Over time, all of

2024
00:39:51.195 --> 00:39:52.016
a sudden, they have

2025
00:39:52.016 --> 00:39:53.795
90% confidence that a

2026
00:39:53.795 --> 00:39:55.215
whole class of chores

2027
00:39:55.215 --> 00:39:56.275
or bugs will ship

2028
00:39:56.315 --> 00:39:57.653
with minimal risk. They

2029
00:39:57.653 --> 00:39:58.753
write a single prompt,

2030
00:39:58.914 --> 00:40:00.014
hit enter and ship
