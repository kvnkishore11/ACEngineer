2088
00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:00.610
fashion. But the real

2089
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.369
thing, the real hurdle,

2090
00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:04.869
the challenge of tactical

2091
00:41:04.889 --> 00:41:06.349
agentic coding is about

2092
00:41:06.507 --> 00:41:08.188
your belief You have

2093
00:41:08.188 --> 00:41:09.447
to believe that the

2094
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.786
agentic layer is worth

2095
00:41:10.786 --> 00:41:11.806
investing into you. You

2096
00:41:11.806 --> 00:41:13.065
have to trust me.

2097
00:41:13.085 --> 00:41:14.146
You have to invest

2098
00:41:14.206 --> 00:41:15.565
into this, okay? If

2099
00:41:15.565 --> 00:41:16.405
you don't believe that

2100
00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:17.224
your agents can run

2101
00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:18.284
your codebase, you're

2102
00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:19.664
cooked, all right? I

2103
00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:20.563
can't be any more

2104
00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:21.304
blunt than I am

2105
00:41:21.364 --> 00:41:22.722
here. I'm trying to

2106
00:41:22.722 --> 00:41:23.922
give you everything you

2107
00:41:23.922 --> 00:41:25.222
need here, okay? If

2108
00:41:25.222 --> 00:41:26.161
you think that zero-touch

2109
00:41:26.161 --> 00:41:27.641
engineering is in the

2110
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.780
far future for you,

2111
00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:29.960
that's fine. You know

2112
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.760
what? You might be
