375
00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:00.824
every single tactic, it

376
00:08:00.824 --> 00:08:02.244
scales to your code

377
00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:03.803
base. You're wrapping your

378
00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:04.723
codebase in a

379
00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.043
new agentic layer that

380
00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:07.802
operates your codebase

381
00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.223
on your behalf, okay?

382
00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:10.382
As usual, we're going

383
00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:11.182
to open up the

384
00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:13.423
terminal and we're going

385
00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:14.223
to clone in the

386
00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:15.062
less than seven code

387
00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:16.942
base. Git clone, CD

388
00:08:16.942 --> 00:08:18.629
into text seven. And

389
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:19.350
I'll fire up code

390
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.089
right here. We're gonna

391
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:21.329
run our normal usual

392
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:22.048
workflow. So I'm gonna

393
00:08:22.048 --> 00:08:22.949
fire up Claude in

394
00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:23.608
yellow mode. I'm gonna

395
00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:25.028
run slash install. You

396
00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:25.829
know this workflow, we've

397
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:26.427
been doing it back

398
00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:27.108
to back to back.

399
00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:28.108
We don't do this

400
00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:29.848
hands-on simple work anymore.

401
00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:30.887
Our agents do all
