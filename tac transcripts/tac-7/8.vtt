154
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.729
can operate and then

155
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.768
update the documentation when

156
00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:03.587
the time is right.

157
00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:04.387
Great. So we know

158
00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:05.705
what we're doing, but

159
00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:07.724
what's the tactical advantage

160
00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:09.063
we're learning in this

161
00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:11.042
lesson. This lessons tactic,

162
00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.514
solves many issues engineers

163
00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:14.832
face when working with

164
00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:16.333
agents today this tactic

165
00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.233
drives great agentic development

166
00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:19.831
at scale because it

167
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.031
forces us to make

168
00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.812
a controversial decision and

169
00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:23.771
commit to it in

170
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.290
return we completely sidestep

171
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.071
a massive list of

172
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.050
Agentic Coding potholes and
