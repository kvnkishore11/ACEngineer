144
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.540
going to do here

145
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.039
is rapidly enhance this

146
00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.638
application. Okay, our agents

147
00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:34.277
know how to operate

148
00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:35.637
this codebase. Let's

149
00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:36.496
put them to work.

150
00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.634
So we have code

151
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.574
open here. We have

152
00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:39.673
our web hook ready

153
00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.292
to go. Remove focus,

154
00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:43.069
open up GitHub issues.

155
00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:44.301
because this is our

156
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:45.622
prompt source. Remember the

157
00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:46.741
Peter framework, you have

158
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:48.580
prompt input, your trigger

159
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.961
environment, and your review

160
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.221
system. Our prompt input

161
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.121
is of course, GitHub

162
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:52.700
issues. Let's go ahead

163
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.881
and fire up two,

164
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.900
three, four, five pieces

165
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.639
of work that will

166
00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.000
run end to end.

167
00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.580
Let's go ahead and

168
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.519
run like various levels
