WEBVTT

1255
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.332
drag and drop feature.

1256
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:00.730
So I'm just going

1257
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.250
to move this right

1258
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.209
here. Select five users.

1259
00:25:03.308 --> 00:25:03.909
We can fire that

1260
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:04.728
off. We'll of course

1261
00:25:04.728 --> 00:25:05.667
get five users. We

1262
00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:06.967
can hit upload. You

1263
00:25:06.967 --> 00:25:08.904
can see previous items

1264
00:25:08.904 --> 00:25:09.444
there. We can hit

1265
00:25:09.444 --> 00:25:11.262
our event analytics. That

1266
00:25:11.262 --> 00:25:12.342
events table got created.

1267
00:25:12.342 --> 00:25:12.922
Great. We can, of

1268
00:25:12.922 --> 00:25:14.421
course, delete it. Blah,

1269
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:16.119
blah, blah. Let's refresh.

1270
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.378
And now let's drag

1271
00:25:17.378 --> 00:25:18.778
and drop over this

1272
00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:19.738
UI, right? Cause that

1273
00:25:19.738 --> 00:25:20.438
was that net new

1274
00:25:20.438 --> 00:25:21.438
feature. We're just doing

1275
00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:22.537
simple human in the

1276
00:25:22.537 --> 00:25:23.717
loop testing here, drag

1277
00:25:23.717 --> 00:25:24.396
and drop. Let's go

1278
00:25:24.396 --> 00:25:25.717
and do that events.json.

1279
00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:26.477
And yeah, let me

1280
00:25:26.477 --> 00:25:27.017
move this a little

1281
00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:27.436
bit so you can

1282
00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:28.175
see this. That's not

1283
00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:28.915
JSON. So check this

1284
00:25:28.915 --> 00:25:30.496
out. Nice, clean drag
