833
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.830
Heavy forward opus, we

834
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.789
are running a beefed

835
00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:03.389
up model. So this

836
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:04.148
is all that this

837
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:04.749
does, right? It gives

838
00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:05.748
us a little knob

839
00:17:05.748 --> 00:17:07.428
to turn to increase

840
00:17:07.428 --> 00:17:08.646
the compute that our

841
00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:09.707
workflow uses, right? In

842
00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:11.007
this case, by compute,

843
00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:12.045
I specifically mean the

844
00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:13.144
model that we're using,

845
00:17:13.163 --> 00:17:14.143
all right? So exact

846
00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:15.602
same prompts, exact same

847
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:17.220
reasoning when it's called

848
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.239
out. Inside of our

849
00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:19.478
prompts, we of course

850
00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:20.955
have the, let's go

851
00:17:20.976 --> 00:17:23.173
to our chore.md, right?

852
00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:24.253
If you just search

853
00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:24.834
think, you can see

854
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:25.713
we have the encoded

855
00:17:25.773 --> 00:17:27.133
think hard information dense

856
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:28.292
keyword. This is fantastic.

857
00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:28.992
You can find this,

858
00:17:28.992 --> 00:17:30.012
you know, all over.
