76
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.578
a level beyond Outloop

77
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.418
Systems. We'll understand a

78
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:03.658
critical moment in the

79
00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:05.397
future where human in

80
00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:06.956
the loop review becomes

81
00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:08.336
a bottleneck, not a

82
00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.756
safety net. This tactic

83
00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:10.675
will lead us to

84
00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:12.413
the secret of tactical

85
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.413
agentic coding. Let's collect

86
00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:16.473
the incredible dividends from

87
00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:17.731
our complete end to

88
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.151
end Outloop agentic system.

89
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.151
I wanna showcase that

90
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:22.810
once you've invested in

91
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.188
your Outloop system. Once

92
00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:25.429
you've built the system

93
00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:26.647
that builds the system,

94
00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:27.647
it's going to pay

95
00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.206
you back massively. Let's

96
00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.286
prompt and while our
