WEBVTT

1392
00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:30.074
it needs to. And

1393
00:27:30.074 --> 00:27:30.732
our agent is doing

1394
00:27:30.853 --> 00:27:31.672
all this in its

1395
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:33.829
own isolated environment, in

1396
00:27:33.829 --> 00:27:34.648
its own Git work

1397
00:27:34.648 --> 00:27:35.489
tree, so that we

1398
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:37.106
can parallelize all this

1399
00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.346
work up. This is

1400
00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:39.025
big. Some of these

1401
00:27:39.025 --> 00:27:39.923
other features, let me

1402
00:27:39.923 --> 00:27:40.564
just take a quick

1403
00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:41.222
look at these other

1404
00:27:41.222 --> 00:27:44.053
features. JSON, there we

1405
00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:44.692
go, check this out.

1406
00:27:44.692 --> 00:27:45.613
We got our JSON

1407
00:27:45.633 --> 00:27:46.832
there. That looks great.

1408
00:27:46.892 --> 00:27:47.491
You know, we don't

1409
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:48.050
need to go through

1410
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.951
all these features, right?

1411
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.010
What I wanna communicate

1412
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.930
here as we start

1413
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.328
rounding out tactical agentic

1414
00:27:52.328 --> 00:27:53.709
coding is that investing

1415
00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:54.667
in the agentic layer

1416
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:55.548
of your codebase

1417
00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:57.426
provides you with asymmetric

1418
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:59.105
results, okay? You can't

1419
00:27:59.105 --> 00:28:00.445
vibe code this stuff.
