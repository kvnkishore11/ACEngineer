1068
00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:31.184
that the feature has

1069
00:21:31.184 --> 00:21:32.305
shipped. Check this out,

1070
00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:33.144
right? Drag and drop.

1071
00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:34.484
We now have this

1072
00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:35.684
overlay right here. We

1073
00:21:35.684 --> 00:21:36.463
have this overlay right

1074
00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:37.324
here, right? Drop to

1075
00:21:37.324 --> 00:21:38.443
create a table. And

1076
00:21:38.443 --> 00:21:39.683
our screenshot for its

1077
00:21:39.683 --> 00:21:40.763
regression testing, making sure

1078
00:21:40.763 --> 00:21:41.784
that everything looks good.

1079
00:21:41.784 --> 00:21:43.542
This is beautiful. Agents,

1080
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:44.823
they're operating like you

1081
00:21:44.823 --> 00:21:45.923
or I would, right?

1082
00:21:45.942 --> 00:21:46.462
This is what it

1083
00:21:46.462 --> 00:21:47.042
means to have a

1084
00:21:47.042 --> 00:21:48.842
powerful agentic layer, right?

1085
00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:51.029
They've uploaded screenshots. It's

1086
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:52.549
proof of value. Remember

1087
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:53.529
what the review step

1088
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:54.848
answers. It's not, does

1089
00:21:54.848 --> 00:21:56.068
it work? It's is

1090
00:21:56.068 --> 00:21:56.709
what we built, what

1091
00:21:56.709 --> 00:21:58.189
we asked for. And

1092
00:21:58.189 --> 00:21:58.808
you can see here,

1093
00:21:58.808 --> 00:21:59.628
this is exactly what

1094
00:21:59.628 --> 00:22:00.208
we asked for in
