1513
00:29:58.941 --> 00:30:00.961
question is, right? It's

1514
00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:02.440
not enough to push

1515
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.140
it to the edge.

1516
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.940
Let's go beyond the

1517
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.558
edge. What happens next,

1518
00:30:05.558 --> 00:30:06.519
right? What happens after

1519
00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:07.637
your agents are, look

1520
00:30:07.637 --> 00:30:08.258
at this, right? Your

1521
00:30:08.258 --> 00:30:09.637
agents are testing for

1522
00:30:09.637 --> 00:30:10.717
us, pie test, found

1523
00:30:10.717 --> 00:30:11.957
an issue, five failed

1524
00:30:11.957 --> 00:30:12.976
tests. Now it's going

1525
00:30:12.976 --> 00:30:14.056
to resolve these issues.

1526
00:30:14.056 --> 00:30:15.914
What happens when we

1527
00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:16.775
get so good at

1528
00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:18.414
this that just like

1529
00:30:18.414 --> 00:30:19.114
you saw here with

1530
00:30:19.114 --> 00:30:20.153
our drag and drop

1531
00:30:20.153 --> 00:30:21.074
feature, Your agent ships

1532
00:30:21.074 --> 00:30:21.993
end to end and

1533
00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:24.692
me reviewing obviously is

1534
00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:25.873
important here for us.

1535
00:30:25.873 --> 00:30:26.932
But imagine you do

1536
00:30:26.932 --> 00:30:28.492
this for the 10th

1537
00:30:28.492 --> 00:30:30.051
time you shipped a
