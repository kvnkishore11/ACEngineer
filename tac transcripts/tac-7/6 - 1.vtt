WEBVTT

119
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.133
new agentic layer of

120
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.234
our codebase. As

121
00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:01.973
you can see here,

122
00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.073
we have our dedicated

123
00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:04.513
agent environment up and

124
00:03:04.513 --> 00:03:06.331
running. The webhook trigger

125
00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:07.752
is ready for prompts

126
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:08.651
coming in from GitHub

127
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.631
issues, which is our

128
00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.050
prompt input from our

129
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.531
Peter framework. We've templated

130
00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:14.030
our engineering. We're operating

131
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.810
out the loop so

132
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.830
we can scale our

133
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.429
impact as easily as

134
00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.188
copying a file. Let

135
00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:20.429
me open up our

136
00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.388
agent environment. You can

137
00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:22.388
see this is a

138
00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:23.747
screen If I run

139
00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.066
Chrome, you can see

140
00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.305
refresh, refresh. You can

141
00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:27.123
see our codebase,

142
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.443
right? Classic natural language

143
00:03:28.443 --> 00:03:29.801
SQL interface. What we're

144
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.540
going to do here
