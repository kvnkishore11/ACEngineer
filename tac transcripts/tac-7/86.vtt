2189
00:42:59.427 --> 00:43:00.307
will come from. They're

2190
00:43:00.307 --> 00:43:01.606
wondering what's all the

2191
00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.967
capex spend for. I've

2192
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:04.106
known this answer from

2193
00:43:04.106 --> 00:43:05.106
the beginning. It's not

2194
00:43:05.126 --> 00:43:06.525
AGI, it's not ASI,

2195
00:43:06.525 --> 00:43:07.983
right? Since the beginning,

2196
00:43:08.204 --> 00:43:10.063
since GPT 3.5, when

2197
00:43:10.063 --> 00:43:11.182
I saw this technology

2198
00:43:11.182 --> 00:43:12.282
and started moving ahead

2199
00:43:12.282 --> 00:43:13.081
of the curve, I

2200
00:43:13.081 --> 00:43:13.882
knew the answer from

2201
00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:15.061
the beginning. It's you,

2202
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:16.320
the engineer with their

2203
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.239
boots on the ground,

2204
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.498
solving one problem at

2205
00:43:18.498 --> 00:43:20.179
a time, shipping real

2206
00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:22.378
value, using AI like

2207
00:43:22.378 --> 00:43:23.657
no one else can,

2208
00:43:23.677 --> 00:43:24.916
using compute like no

2209
00:43:24.916 --> 00:43:25.996
one else can, except

2210
00:43:25.996 --> 00:43:27.195
the The problem, and

2211
00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:27.815
this is the tricky

2212
00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:28.856
part, focusing on the

2213
00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:30.476
right problem is key.
