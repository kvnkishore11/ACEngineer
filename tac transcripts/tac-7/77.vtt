1946
00:38:29.143 --> 00:38:30.163
times and they'll do

1947
00:38:30.163 --> 00:38:31.282
it 20 times and

1948
00:38:31.282 --> 00:38:31.902
then they'll do it.

1949
00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:32.862
Here's the important part

1950
00:38:32.862 --> 00:38:33.541
five times in a

1951
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:35.240
row. And you'll realize

1952
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.420
that you add no

1953
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.840
value by reviewing. In

1954
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.340
fact, you slowed things

1955
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.300
down. And this is

1956
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.679
the key. Of course,

1957
00:38:41.679 --> 00:38:43.478
here in tactical Agentecoding,

1958
00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:44.478
you and I, we're

1959
00:38:44.478 --> 00:38:45.298
not focused on the

1960
00:38:45.298 --> 00:38:46.277
present. We're not focused

1961
00:38:46.277 --> 00:38:47.137
on the past. We

1962
00:38:47.137 --> 00:38:47.797
want to be on

1963
00:38:47.797 --> 00:38:48.577
that in that sweet

1964
00:38:48.577 --> 00:38:49.797
spot, leaning toward the

1965
00:38:49.797 --> 00:38:51.456
future. Here's a great

1966
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:52.277
visual for you. The

1967
00:38:52.277 --> 00:38:53.215
future is coming at

1968
00:38:53.215 --> 00:38:54.096
you at a constant

1969
00:38:54.096 --> 00:38:55.215
pace. You have three

1970
00:38:55.215 --> 00:38:56.976
options really four options

1971
00:38:56.976 --> 00:38:58.275
you can neglect the

1972
00:38:58.275 --> 00:38:59.135
change and just run

1973
00:38:59.135 --> 00:38:59.755
away do it the

1974
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:00.594
old way go in
