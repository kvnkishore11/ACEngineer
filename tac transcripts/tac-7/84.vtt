2142
00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:00.945
because you understand and

2143
00:42:00.945 --> 00:42:02.304
control the agentic layer

2144
00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:03.103
of your codebase.

2145
00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:04.023
This is the area

2146
00:42:04.204 --> 00:42:05.523
of highest leverage. I

2147
00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:06.322
don't think it's far-fetched

2148
00:42:06.382 --> 00:42:07.021
at all to say

2149
00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:09.061
you'll get exponential leverage

2150
00:42:09.121 --> 00:42:10.719
by allowing agents to

2151
00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:11.579
run your codebase

2152
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.918
and by templating your

2153
00:42:12.918 --> 00:42:14.177
engineering. Okay. I don't

2154
00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:15.018
think that's far-fetched at

2155
00:42:15.018 --> 00:42:15.817
all. And I mean

2156
00:42:15.817 --> 00:42:17.036
this from a brute

2157
00:42:17.175 --> 00:42:19.994
objective career defensibility standpoint,

2158
00:42:20.014 --> 00:42:21.989
from a tactical angle,

2159
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.967
you'll understand this technology

2160
00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:25.387
so well that it

2161
00:42:25.387 --> 00:42:26.726
would be crazy for

2162
00:42:26.726 --> 00:42:27.925
anyone in your organization,

2163
00:42:27.925 --> 00:42:28.864
anyone on your team

2164
00:42:28.864 --> 00:42:30.063
to conceive of letting
