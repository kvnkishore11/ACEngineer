By just using existing

1045
00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:03.438
technology, you can spin

1046
00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:04.356
this up and get

1047

it's important to note

1049
00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:07.276
that the review system

1050
00:21:07.316 --> 00:21:08.855
is critical for increasing

1051
00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:10.775
your agent engineering velocity

1052
00:21:10.835 --> 00:21:11.933
for the review step.

1053
00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:13.693
Concretely, We should have

1054
00:21:13.693 --> 00:21:14.613
a feature now that

1055
00:21:14.613 --> 00:21:15.173
here we go. That's

1056
00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.092
completed. It's it's review.

review. This is critical,

1061
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.648
right? Here's the review

1062
00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:22.929
summary enhance drag and

1063
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.067
drop feature for both

1064
00:21:24.228 --> 00:21:26.186
query and table selection.

1065
00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:26.866
So check this out.

1066
00:21:26.866 --> 00:21:28.806
Our agents. Took images

1067
00:21:28.846 --> 00:21:29.885
and gave us proof

1068
00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:31.184
that the feature has
