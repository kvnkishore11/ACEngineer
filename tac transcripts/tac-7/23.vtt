545
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:30.187
environments, it only matters

546
00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:31.048
that you can, all

547
00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:32.567
right? So we've adjusted

548
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.765
all of our workflows

549
00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:34.764
to create their own

550
00:11:34.764 --> 00:11:36.783
isolated trees. Check this

551
00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:37.863
out. In every tree,

552
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:38.542
right, in every one

553
00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:39.682
of these directories, the

554
00:11:39.682 --> 00:11:41.440
application exists for a

555
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.979
specific agent to build

556
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:43.458
in. This is the

557
00:11:43.458 --> 00:11:44.557
easiest way to parallelize

558
00:11:44.557 --> 00:11:45.657
your workflows and to

559
00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:47.056
scale up agents into

560
00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:47.676
your work. You can

561
00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:48.514
see we have all

562
00:11:48.514 --> 00:11:49.634
of our environment variables,

563
00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:51.293
our playwright configuration at

564
00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:51.913
the beginning of our

565
00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:52.772
workflow. And we can

566
00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:53.610
of course just search

567
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.591
this, right? Because we

568
00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:55.710
know how to navigate

569
00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:57.730
the agentic layer slash

570
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.349
install work. You can

571
00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:00.568
see here in plan
