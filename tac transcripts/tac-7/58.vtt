1464
00:28:59.193 --> 00:29:01.133
features, right? We're shipping,

1465
00:29:01.313 --> 00:29:02.113
we're shipping end to

1466
00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:02.612
end. Check out this

1467
00:29:02.612 --> 00:29:03.291
workflow. This is a

1468
00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:05.390
27 minute heavy model

1469
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.848
workflow that is building

1470
00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:08.407
out table random data

1471
00:29:08.407 --> 00:29:10.766
generation. This problem, this

1472
00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:11.865
engineering problem could be

1473
00:29:11.865 --> 00:29:13.324
anything. When we look

1474
00:29:13.324 --> 00:29:14.282
back at all this,

1475
00:29:14.643 --> 00:29:16.321
let me just pause

1476
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:16.901
here for a moment.

1477
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.380
Let's just talk about

1478
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.880
what we're doing here.

1479
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.958
When the agents arrived,

1480
00:29:21.057 --> 00:29:22.497
Something changed. We weren't

1481
00:29:22.497 --> 00:29:24.017
just AI coding anymore.

1482
00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:26.375
We started orchestrating intelligence.

1483
00:29:26.414 --> 00:29:27.154
We're going to look

1484
00:29:27.154 --> 00:29:27.954
back at this time

1485
00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.433
