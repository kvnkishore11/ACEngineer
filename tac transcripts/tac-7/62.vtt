1562
00:30:59.244 --> 00:31:00.384
for this class of

1563
00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:01.663
problems. Once you come

1564
00:31:01.663 --> 00:31:02.742
to this realization, and

1565
00:31:02.742 --> 00:31:03.781
trust me, if you

1566
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:05.080
bet big and invest

1567
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.180
in your agentic layer,

1568
00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.319
this will happen. You

1569
00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:08.278
will arrive at the

1570
00:31:08.278 --> 00:31:10.077
next order of magnitude

1571
00:31:10.298 --> 00:31:12.038
the Agentic Engineering velocity

1572
00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:13.537
scale first we're in

1573
00:31:13.537 --> 00:31:14.717
the loop next we're

1574
00:31:14.717 --> 00:31:15.537
out the loop and

1575
00:31:15.537 --> 00:31:16.996
then we're doing z

1576
00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:19.195
t e zero touch

1577
00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:21.355
engineering you'll drop yourself

1578
00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:22.575
off the end of

1579
00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:24.535
the Outloop Peter framework

1580
00:31:24.575 --> 00:31:26.074
and it becomes Pete

1581
00:31:26.193 --> 00:31:27.574
not Peter you'll drop

1582
00:31:27.574 --> 00:31:29.217
off the review, okay?

1583
00:31:29.457 --> 00:31:30.557
This is the next
