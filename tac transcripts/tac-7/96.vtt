2437
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:00.670
the loop because you

2438
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.210
have one agent, operating

2439
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.509
on one prompt with

2440
00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:04.807
a single purpose. You

2441
00:48:04.807 --> 00:48:05.927
have more precision while

2442
00:48:05.927 --> 00:48:06.706
other engineers are trying

2443
00:48:06.706 --> 00:48:07.827
to stack up into

2444
00:48:07.827 --> 00:48:09.286
one context window. You're

2445
00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:12.443
firing strongly defined specialized

2446
00:48:12.443 --> 00:48:14.262
agents that execute one

2447
00:48:14.262 --> 00:48:14.942
task at a time

2448
00:48:14.942 --> 00:48:15.702
and hand off their

2449
00:48:15.702 --> 00:48:17.380
work. You are composing,

2450
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:19.900
you are orchestrating intelligence.

2451
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.159
It's about the primitives.

2452
00:48:21.239 --> 00:48:22.297
This is the secret

2453
00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:23.817
of tactical agent decoding.

2454
00:48:24.757 --> 00:48:25.876
Let's check our Zero

2455
00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:27.655
Touch engineering workflow. And

2456
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:28.514
you can see here,

2457
00:48:28.514 --> 00:48:30.329
it has been deployed
