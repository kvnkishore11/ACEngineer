549
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:32.279
context window specifically for

550
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.399
the task type at

551
00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.500
hand. So with every

552
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.099
codebase, I always

553
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:38.217
set up Claude commands

554
00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:39.498
You can see here

555
00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:40.337
we have two prime

556
00:13:40.337 --> 00:13:41.398
commands in this code

557
00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:42.937
base. Priming is just

558
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:44.057
a reusable prompt. We

559
00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:44.537
can take a look

560
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:45.277
at this right here.

561
00:13:45.277 --> 00:13:46.596
It's very simple. It

562
00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:48.196
has a concise structure

563
00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:48.956
where we have the

564
00:13:48.956 --> 00:13:50.395
purpose, we have our

565
00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:51.196
run step, we have

566
00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:52.176
a read step and

567
00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:53.495
a report step. Okay,

568
00:13:53.676 --> 00:13:54.754
now our agent is

569
00:13:54.754 --> 00:13:55.934
ready to go. So

570
00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:56.534
it's read a couple

571
00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:57.615
files, it's read the

572
00:13:57.615 --> 00:13:59.034
readme, it understands the

573
00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:00.193
structure of the code
