2565
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.380
codebase. And here's

2566
00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.480
the kicker, you have

2567
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.018
them auto update their

2568
00:57:33.018 --> 00:57:34.577
own knowledge. This is

2569
00:57:34.577 --> 00:57:36.574
the agent experts technique.

2570
00:57:36.695 --> 00:57:37.054
Let me show you

2571
00:57:37.054 --> 00:57:38.434
exactly how. Inside of

2572
00:57:38.434 --> 00:57:40.353
our Claude commands directory

2573
00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:41.411
here, we have an

2574
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:43.192
experts directory. Right now

2575
00:57:43.192 --> 00:57:44.170
we have a single

2576
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:45.070
expert in this code

2577
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:45.989
base and you can

2578
00:57:45.989 --> 00:57:47.269
see this agent expert

2579
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:48.789
is focused on Claude

2580
00:57:48.889 --> 00:57:50.568
code hooks. Now, before

2581
00:57:50.568 --> 00:57:51.608
we move forward, let

2582
00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:52.487
me just kick off

2583
00:57:52.567 --> 00:57:53.706
this expert. So I'm

2584
00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:54.686
gonna run this prompt

2585
00:57:54.686 --> 00:57:55.266
and I'll just paste

2586
00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:56.186
this in for brevity.

2587
00:57:56.304 --> 00:57:58.324
I'll type slash experts.

2588
00:57:58.364 --> 00:57:58.824
And so now we

2589
00:57:58.824 --> 00:57:59.463
can just see all

2590
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:00.463
of our experts and
