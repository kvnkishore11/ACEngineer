416
00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.024
here just to showcase

417
00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:32.163
this idea, but I

418
00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:33.283
can almost guarantee you

419
00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:34.962
there's an engineer out

420
00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:35.861
there somewhere with a

421
00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:37.642
claw.md file that is,

422
00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.140
you know, 3,000 lines

423
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.081
long. And why is

424
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.221
that? It's because they

425
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:42.441
and their team, they've

426
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:45.100
just constantly added additional

427
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.080
items to their memory

428
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.219
over and over and

429
00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:48.458
over again until it's

430
00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.019
become what it is

431
00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:51.918
now. Okay, a massive

432
00:10:51.957 --> 00:10:53.697
glob of mess, okay?

433
00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:54.836
Even the claw code

434
00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:55.897
engineers built in a

435
00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:57.297
warning here for us.

436
00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:59.716
Large claw.md will impact

437
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:01.215
performance What they're really
