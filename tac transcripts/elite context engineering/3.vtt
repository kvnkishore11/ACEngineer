49
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.868
in-agent leverage point that

50
00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:32.489
determines how an agent

51
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:34.308
performs at any given

52
00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:35.489
task there's a sweet

53
00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:36.769
spot a range of

54
00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:38.328
context where your agent

55
00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:40.028
performs to its maximum

56
00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:41.968
possible capability for the

57
00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.207
task at hand as

58
00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:44.128
you scale up to

59
00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:45.427
hundreds and thousands of

60
00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:47.186
agent executions hitting this

61
00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.846
sweet spot consistently becomes

62
00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.326
even more important and

63
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.266
we do that with

64
00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:54.406
context engineering we obsessively

65
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.286
manage the context going

66
00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.816
in our agents. We

67
00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.394
adopt our agents perspective

68
00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.051
to gain an awareness
