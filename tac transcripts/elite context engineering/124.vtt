2777
01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:00.434
have one agent planning,

2778
01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:01.393
we have the other

2779
01:02:01.474 --> 01:02:02.552
building, and we have

2780
01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.831
the last self improving.

2781
01:02:04.831 --> 01:02:06.389
Whatever changes we make

2782
01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.688
to this system, our

2783
01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:09.788
improve expert, our sub

2784
01:02:09.847 --> 01:02:10.987
prompt, our sub agent

2785
01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:12.425
inside of this three

2786
01:02:12.425 --> 01:02:14.144
step expert is going

2787
01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:14.905
to look back at

2788
01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.422
the changes made and

2789
01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.862
update the plan and

2790
01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:19.240
the build to have

2791
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.619
the details of the

2792
01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:22.436
implementation. The planner thinks

2793
01:02:22.436 --> 01:02:22.876
about what needs to

2794
01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:23.753
be done and then

2795
01:02:23.753 --> 01:02:25.052
its context window is

2796
01:02:25.052 --> 01:02:25.911
gone, right? We don't

2797
01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:26.710
need it anymore. The

2798
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.088
builder takes the plan

2799
01:02:28.088 --> 01:02:29.858
and actually implements it,

2800
01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:30.737
right? This is a
