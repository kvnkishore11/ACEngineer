WEBVTT

1706
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.309
prime our Claude Code,

1707
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.047
right? So we're running

1708
00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:32.768
our prime command around

1709
00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:33.527
Claude Code and you

1710
00:38:33.527 --> 00:38:34.467
can see this context

1711
00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:35.907
bundle was generated, okay?

1712
00:38:36.027 --> 00:38:36.925
So there's the prompt

1713
00:38:37.045 --> 00:38:38.304
and let's just pay

1714
00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:39.065
attention to what this

1715
00:38:39.065 --> 00:38:40.065
does, all right? We

1716
00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:40.943
have read commands, we

1717
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.143
have search commands. Our

1718
00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:43.003
read commands are all

1719
00:38:43.003 --> 00:38:44.443
getting appended piece by

1720
00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:45.521
piece and what this

1721
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:46.521
does is it gives

1722
00:38:46.521 --> 00:38:48.661
us a solid understanding

1723
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.719
of 60, 70, percent

1724
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.840
of what our previous

1725
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.420
agents have done okay

1726
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.219
and so why is

1727
00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:55.039
this important this is

1728
00:38:55.039 --> 00:38:56.018
important because it tells

1729
00:38:56.018 --> 00:38:57.679
a fuller story for

1730
00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:59.278
subsequent agents to execute

1731
00:38:59.278 --> 00:38:59.818
there's a bunch of

1732
00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:01.878
additional read commands and
