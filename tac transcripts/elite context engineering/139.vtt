3125
01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:30.061
compact problem. Right next

3126
01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.060
to that and very,

3127
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.060
very closely related, we

3128
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060
are likely to see

3129
01:09:33.121 --> 01:09:34.539
better context windows coming

3130
01:09:34.539 --> 01:09:35.000
out of these big

3131
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.559
labs. Language models, they

3132
01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:37.938
tend to lose massive

3133
01:09:37.978 --> 01:09:39.737
capability as the context

3134
01:09:39.737 --> 01:09:41.056
size grows. This is

3135
01:09:41.056 --> 01:09:42.695
an attention mechanism problem

3136
01:09:42.815 --> 01:09:44.194
inside of modern agents.

3137
01:09:44.274 --> 01:09:45.234
You can plan and

3138
01:09:45.234 --> 01:09:46.394
bet on big labs

3139
01:09:46.394 --> 01:09:49.012
focusing on better effective

3140
01:09:49.012 --> 01:09:50.992
context windows. Okay, another

3141
01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:51.832
big idea Here is

3142
01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.810
hot swapped context windows,

3143
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:55.291
hot swapping tools, hot

3144
01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.010
swapping context in general,

3145
01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.390
right? Hot swapping the

3146
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.948
system prompt like cloud

3147
01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.088
codes, output styles enable
