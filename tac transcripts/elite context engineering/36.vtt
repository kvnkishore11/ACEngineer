748
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:00.553
talking to us. It's

749
00:18:00.553 --> 00:18:02.053
not interested in chewing

750
00:18:02.093 --> 00:18:03.472
up output tokens. Now

751
00:18:03.593 --> 00:18:04.212
here on the right

752
00:18:04.212 --> 00:18:04.811
side, if we type

753
00:18:04.872 --> 00:18:06.311
output styles, you can

754
00:18:06.311 --> 00:18:07.092
see we're running the

755
00:18:07.092 --> 00:18:08.092
default. And let me

756
00:18:08.092 --> 00:18:08.751
actually go ahead and

757
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:09.510
get this in YOLO

758
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.411
mode here as well,

759
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.550
running the Sonnet model.

760
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.830
Output styles here, we

761
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.650
have default. And if

762
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.390
we say hi here,

763
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.009
we're of course gonna

764
00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:17.000
get a normal response

765
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.641
coming out of cloud

766
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.778
code, okay? So right

767
00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:20.837
away with just a

768
00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:22.696
high, we are getting

769
00:18:22.696 --> 00:18:23.875
a massive difference in

770
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.414
output tokens, okay? And

771
00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:26.493
keep in mind, these

772
00:18:26.493 --> 00:18:28.212
are output tokens, right?

773
00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.172
Let's kick this up,

774
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:29.750
right? Let me show

775
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.990
you the scale in
