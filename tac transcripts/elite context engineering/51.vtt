WEBVTT

1117
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:30.261
a great use case

1118
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:31.681
for sub-agents. We have

1119
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:33.420
this workflow where Dock

1120
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.420
Scraper, You know, we

1121
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.598
have this system prompt

1122
00:25:35.598 --> 00:25:37.498
here that details exactly

1123
00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:38.817
how to web scrape

1124
00:25:38.938 --> 00:25:41.376
with Firecrawl or Webfetch,

1125
00:25:41.537 --> 00:25:42.796
right? Whatever web scraping

1126
00:25:42.816 --> 00:25:44.236
tool you wanna use,

1127
00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:45.315
it has it here.

1128
00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:45.734
This would be a

1129
00:25:45.734 --> 00:25:46.753
good example for us

1130
00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:47.753
to fire up and

1131
00:25:47.753 --> 00:25:50.272
load that one MCP

1132
00:25:50.272 --> 00:25:51.491
server. But now these

1133
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:52.692
agents are just going

1134
00:25:52.692 --> 00:25:53.711
to run the scrape,

1135
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.871
which will consume their

1136
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:55.970
context window. And then

1137
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.990
they're going to write

1138
00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:58.001
the output files, right?

1139
00:25:58.001 --> 00:25:58.560
So now we should

1140
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.401
