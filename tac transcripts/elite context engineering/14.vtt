262
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.000
with this swing of

263
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
your agent. And if

264
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.841
you boot up five

265
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.300
agents over an hour,

266
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:04.860
that's 25% of a

267
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.439
context window in total,

268
00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.480
completely wasted, okay? Unless

269
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.800
you're always using every

270
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.939
single MCP server, which

271
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.178
I highly doubt, okay?

272
00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:13.918
As you can see,

273
00:07:13.918 --> 00:07:14.838
these numbers will stack

274
00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:15.759
up against you very

275
00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.978
quickly. The first thing

276
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.338
I recommend doing is

277
00:07:18.478 --> 00:07:19.978
get rid of this.mcp.json.

278
00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:22.458
Just completely delete this

279
00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.069
thing. Okay, don't use

280
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.346
a default.mcp.json for your

281
00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.565
codebase. All right,

282
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:28.384
and why is that?

283
00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:29.485
It's because right away

284
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.923
clears up our context
