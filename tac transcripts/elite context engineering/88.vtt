1952
00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:00.128
prompt. This is how

1953
00:44:00.128 --> 00:44:01.487
you build your agents

1954
00:44:01.646 --> 00:44:03.365
and gain find tune

1955
00:44:03.385 --> 00:44:05.025
control over your agents

1956
00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:06.344
and therefore your context

1957
00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.264
window. There are two

1958
00:44:07.264 --> 00:44:08.922
flags in the Cloud

1959
00:44:08.922 --> 00:44:10.282
Code CLI and the

1960
00:44:10.282 --> 00:44:11.460
SDK. And I'll write

1961
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.561
the full prompt out

1962
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:13.179
here, right? So I

1963
00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:15.498
usually run CLDYS, right?

1964
00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:17.257
Cloud, dangerous, Let's go

1965
00:44:17.257 --> 00:44:18.378
ahead and just paste

1966
00:44:18.378 --> 00:44:19.257
this in here. Then

1967
00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:20.916
we'll run append system

1968
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:21.677
prompt. And then we'll

1969
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:23.436
pass in our specific

1970
00:44:23.516 --> 00:44:24.737
system prompt. When you

1971
00:44:24.737 --> 00:44:25.717
start modifying the system

1972
00:44:25.717 --> 00:44:26.956
prompt, you can't run

1973
00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:27.797
this in the loop,

1974
00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:28.655
okay? So you can't

1975
00:44:28.655 --> 00:44:29.655
open up an instance,

1976
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:30.315
at least not at
