00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.830
agent finishes, it's going

879
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.549
to just report Done.

880
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:33.729
It's not giving us

881
00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:35.846
any extraneous, extra detail,

882
00:20:35.846 --> 00:20:37.306
verbose information. We know

883
00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:38.424
exactly what we asked.

884
00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:39.483
Just tell us if

885
00:20:39.483 --> 00:20:40.442
it was successful or

886
00:20:40.442 --> 00:20:41.422
if it failed. Okay?

887
00:20:41.422 --> 00:20:42.561
And so, you know,

888
00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:43.101
this might seem like

889
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:43.800
a small thing. What

890
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.299
I want to do

891
00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:45.219
is just showcase this

892
00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:46.538
simple idea so that

893
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.916
you can understand at

894
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:49.915
scale how important this

895
00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:50.474
is. Okay? So we'll

896
00:20:50.474 --> 00:20:51.314
paste this in. And

897
00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:52.397
of course, we can

898
00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:54.115
monitor our token usage.

899
00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:54.675
We can see point

900
00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:56.433
blank, this one response

901
00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:57.032
coming out of cloud

902
00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:59.211
code consumed 150 output

903
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.650
tokens, okay? Not too
