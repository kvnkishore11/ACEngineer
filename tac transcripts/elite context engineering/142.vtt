01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.099
A prompt chain. What's

3194
01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:01.677
better than a prompt

3195
01:11:01.677 --> 01:11:03.457
chain? An agent. What's

3196
01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:04.296
better than an agent?

3197
01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:07.373
Many focused, specialized agents

3198
01:11:07.373 --> 01:11:09.252
that deliver value for

3199
01:11:09.252 --> 01:11:10.391
you, for your team,

3200
01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:11.412
and most importantly, for

3201
01:11:11.412 --> 01:11:12.631
your customers and users.

3202
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:13.630
Don't miss this trend.

3203
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:14.988
You now have everything

3204
01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:15.748
you need to win

3205
01:11:15.748 --> 01:11:17.686
and ship with focused,

3206
01:11:17.686 --> 01:11:20.997
single-purposed agents. So all

3207
01:11:20.997 --> 01:11:22.497
these techniques are us

3208
01:11:22.617 --> 01:11:23.775
battling with the fact

3209
01:11:23.775 --> 01:11:24.595
that there are key

3210
01:11:24.595 --> 01:11:26.435
scaling laws and algorithms

3211
01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:27.514
inside of these language

3212
01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:28.793
models, inside of generative

3213
01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.872
AI that decreases performance
