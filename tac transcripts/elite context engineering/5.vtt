87
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.030
agent is usually the

88
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.129
easy part. The real

89
00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.829
trick is finding the

90
00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.788
context agentically and then

91
00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.248
removing and delegating context

92
00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:37.989
so that it doesn't

93
00:02:38.068 --> 00:02:39.568
end up creating context

94
00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.367
rot and context bloat.

95
00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.187
Search and destroy is

96
00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:44.587
the real skill in

97
00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:46.187
context engineering, and we

98
00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.206
can do this better

99
00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:48.687
than anyone with the

100
00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:50.507
R&D framework. When you

101
00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:51.646
boil it down, there

102
00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:52.605
are only two ways

103
00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.686
to manage your context

104
00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:55.485
window, R and D.

105
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.768
reduce and delegate. Every

106
00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:59.127
technique we'll break down

107
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.626
right now fits into
