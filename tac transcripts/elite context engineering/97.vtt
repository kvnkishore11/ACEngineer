2163
00:48:29.217 --> 00:48:30.795
can build out specific

2164
00:48:30.795 --> 00:48:32.574
agents inside of your

2165
00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:34.012
codebases. This is

2166
00:48:34.012 --> 00:48:35.311
where everything is going.

2167
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:37.188
Specific agents with specialized

2168
00:48:37.188 --> 00:48:39.027
context windows solving your

2169
00:48:39.146 --> 00:48:44.179
problems extraordinarily well. The

2170
00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:45.858
focus should always be

2171
00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:47.521
better agents or more

2172
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:48.760
agents? When you're adding

2173
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.159
more agents, you're pushing

2174
00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:51.079
into the D, the

2175
00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:52.659
delegation and the R

2176
00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:53.737
and D framework. You're

2177
00:48:53.737 --> 00:48:54.478
pushing it to the

2178
00:48:54.478 --> 00:48:55.856
max. You're using one

2179
00:48:55.856 --> 00:48:57.197
agent for one purpose.

2180
00:48:57.197 --> 00:48:57.956
And when something goes

2181
00:48:57.956 --> 00:48:59.016
wrong, you fix that

2182
00:48:59.016 --> 00:49:00.775
piece of your workflow.
