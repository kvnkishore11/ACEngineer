00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.016
starting points for understanding

2420
00:54:00.016 --> 00:54:01.094
what you can do

2421
00:54:01.094 --> 00:54:03.393
to better manage the

2422
00:54:03.393 --> 00:54:04.773
context of your agents.

2423
00:54:04.813 --> 00:54:05.492
It's all about the

2424
00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:07.112
patterns. It's all about

2425
00:54:07.132 --> 00:54:08.492
taking control of your

2426
00:54:08.492 --> 00:54:10.271
agents context windows and

2427
00:54:10.271 --> 00:54:11.489
scaling it to the

2428
00:54:11.489 --> 00:54:12.710
moon. The more compute

2429
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:13.509
you can control, the

2430
00:54:13.509 --> 00:54:14.668
more compute you can

2431
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.007
orchestrate, right? The more

2432
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.827
agents you can orchestrate,

2433
00:54:17.827 --> 00:54:19.505
the more intelligence that

2434
00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:20.525
you can orchestrate, the

2435
00:54:20.525 --> 00:54:21.784
more you will be

2436
00:54:21.784 --> 00:54:22.664
able to do the

2437
00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:23.585
limits on what an

2438
00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:24.864
engineer can do right

2439
00:54:24.864 --> 00:54:27.382
now is absolutely unknown.

2440
00:54:27.583 --> 00:54:29.302
Anyone being pessimistic, ignore

2441
00:54:29.322 --> 00:54:31.442
them. Don't take my
