974
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.593
the future of context

975
00:22:30.593 --> 00:22:31.592
engineering at the end

976
00:22:31.592 --> 00:22:32.311
of this lesson, some

977
00:22:32.332 --> 00:22:34.090
potential future directions that

978
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.829
you can bet on.

979
00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:35.390
Let's go ahead and

980
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.689
close our agents and

981
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:37.348
move on to a

982
00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:39.067
big idea, a popular

983
00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.606
idea in the world

984
00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:41.965
of Claude Code. Let's

985
00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:46.864
talk about sub-agents. Now,

986
00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:47.623
it's not just about

987
00:22:47.623 --> 00:22:48.942
using sub-agents. This is

988
00:22:48.942 --> 00:22:51.074
about using sub-agents properly.

989
00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:52.673
When you use Cloud

990
00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:53.732
Code sub agents, you

991
00:22:53.732 --> 00:22:55.271
are effectively creating a

992
00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:57.550
partially forked context window.

993
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.431
Let's create a cloud

994
00:22:58.431 --> 00:22:59.371
instance here. If we

995
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.349
type context in an
