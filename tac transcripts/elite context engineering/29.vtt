594
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.047
different areas of focus

595
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.306
in our codebase.

596
00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:32.765
Okay, so imagine a

597
00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:34.565
you know, prime bug

598
00:14:34.764 --> 00:14:36.144
command, right? For bug

599
00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:37.764
smashing, imagine a prime

600
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.783
chore or prime feature,

601
00:14:39.863 --> 00:14:40.341
or like we have

602
00:14:40.383 --> 00:14:41.221
in this codebase,

603
00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:43.260
prime CC, okay? This

604
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.000
is a focused prompt.

605
00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:45.940
It's our hot loading

606
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.958
memory file for operating

607
00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.038
with Claude code and

608
00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:51.317
updating the Claude code

609
00:14:51.317 --> 00:14:52.336
files inside of this

610
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.836
codebase, okay? And

611
00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:54.275
so, you know, you

612
00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:55.196
can see it looks

613
00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:56.715
very similar. We're actually

614
00:14:56.715 --> 00:14:58.214
running the base prime

615
00:14:58.214 --> 00:14:59.832
command right from the

616
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.011
prime CC command to
