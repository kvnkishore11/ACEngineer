1186
00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:00.873
techniques to other primary

1187
00:27:00.873 --> 00:27:03.092
agents. CloudCo sub-agents have

1188
00:27:03.092 --> 00:27:04.711
limitations. Sub-agents sit at

1189
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.069
the intermediate level for

1190
00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:07.328
a reason because instead

1191
00:27:07.328 --> 00:27:08.048
of keeping track of

1192
00:27:08.048 --> 00:27:09.367
just one set of

1193
00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:11.227
context model prompting tools,

1194
00:27:11.247 --> 00:27:12.306
the core four, we

1195
00:27:12.306 --> 00:27:12.925
now have to keep

1196
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:14.365
track of as many

1197
00:27:14.365 --> 00:27:16.344
as you spawn sub-agents.

1198
00:27:16.364 --> 00:27:17.083
So it becomes super

1199
00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:18.961
important to isolate the

1200
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.094
work that your sub-agents

1201
00:27:20.094 --> 00:27:21.153
are doing into one

1202
00:27:21.153 --> 00:27:23.113
concise prompt to one

1203
00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:25.173
focused effort. Remember, a

1204
00:27:25.173 --> 00:27:26.632
focused agent is a

1205
00:27:26.632 --> 00:27:28.571
performant agent. Sub-agents are

1206
00:27:28.571 --> 00:27:29.852
also a little trickier

1207
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.010
because of the flow
