2182
00:48:59.016 --> 00:49:00.775
piece of your workflow.

2183
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:02.833
Now with primary multi-agent

2184
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.413
delegation, we're entering the

2185
00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:06.572
realm of multi-agent systems.

2186
00:49:06.612 --> 00:49:07.652
In TAC, with each

2187
00:49:07.652 --> 00:49:08.570
lesson, we built up

2188
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.550
variants of a multi-agent

2189
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.909
pipeline using this very

2190
00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:13.088
technique. And in lesson

2191
00:49:13.088 --> 00:49:14.469
eight, we showcase several

2192
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:16.268
different multi-agent workflows and

2193
00:49:16.268 --> 00:49:17.907
systems and uis right

2194
00:49:18.007 --> 00:49:19.266
there are many ways

2195
00:49:19.266 --> 00:49:20.306
to delegate work at

2196
00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:20.827
a high level but

2197
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:21.527
when you get down

2198
00:49:21.527 --> 00:49:21.987
to it if you

2199
00:49:21.987 --> 00:49:23.027
want to create an

2200
00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:25.266
on-the-fly primary agent you

2201
00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:26.367
have two options you

2202
00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:27.505
have the cli and

2203
00:49:27.505 --> 00:49:28.846
you have sdks at

2204
00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:29.626
the mid and high

2205
00:49:29.626 --> 00:49:30.985
level we can kick
