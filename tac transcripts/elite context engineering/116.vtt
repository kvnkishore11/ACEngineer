2590
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:00.463
of our experts and

2591
00:58:00.463 --> 00:58:01.802
I want our planning

2592
00:58:02.003 --> 00:58:03.402
Claude code hook expert.

2593
00:58:03.402 --> 00:58:04.121
And now we'll paste

2594
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:04.840
in a prompt. Okay,

2595
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.360
so I'm gonna paste

2596
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.061
this in. This is

2597
00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:06.860
a simple high to

2598
00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.780
mid-level prompt, We want

2599
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.980
our expert to take

2600
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.840
the wheel on this,

2601
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.780
all right? So what

2602
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.699
does this do? Long

2603
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:14.579
story short here is,

2604
00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:15.059
you can pause the

2605
00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:15.539
video and read it

2606
00:58:15.539 --> 00:58:16.219
if you want. We're

2607
00:58:16.219 --> 00:58:17.619
gonna create a output

2608
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:18.458
structure. So we have

2609
00:58:18.539 --> 00:58:20.378
agents, hook logs for

2610
00:58:20.378 --> 00:58:21.858
every Claude Code instance.

2611
00:58:21.938 --> 00:58:23.219
We want a full

2612
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:25.278
log of every event

2613
00:58:25.338 --> 00:58:26.059
so we can improve

2614
00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:27.059
our agentic coding, right?

2615
00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:28.358
We want additional monitoring.

2616
00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:28.739
So how are we

2617
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:29.458
gonna do that? We're

2618
00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.797
gonna have our Cloud
