3232
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.048
you want done with

3233
01:12:00.048 --> 01:12:01.127
your agents when you're

3234
01:12:01.127 --> 01:12:03.246
delegating when you're reducing

3235
01:12:03.246 --> 01:12:04.645
context, you're going to

3236
01:12:04.645 --> 01:12:05.944
be massively limited and

3237
01:12:05.965 --> 01:12:06.444
you're going to be

3238
01:12:06.444 --> 01:12:07.564
shooting yourself in the

3239
01:12:07.564 --> 01:12:09.024
foot, wasting money, right?

3240
01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:09.604
If you want to

3241
01:12:09.604 --> 01:12:10.925
write the best prompts

3242
01:12:10.944 --> 01:12:11.863
and preserve your context

3243
01:12:11.863 --> 01:12:12.604
window, you want to

3244
01:12:12.604 --> 01:12:13.503
be stacking up these

3245
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.783
big ideas. You'll get

3246
01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:16.024
a ton of value

3247
01:12:16.384 --> 01:12:17.404
out of the agentic

3248
01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:19.502
prompt engineering extended lesson

3249
01:12:19.662 --> 01:12:20.483
I've built out for

3250
01:12:20.523 --> 01:12:22.703
this very purpose. That

3251
01:12:22.823 --> 01:12:24.782
agentic horizon lesson is

3252
01:12:24.782 --> 01:12:26.721
dedicated purely to agentic

3253
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.402
prompt engineering in the

3254
01:12:28.402 --> 01:12:29.761
age of agents. We'll

3255
01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:31.060
be optimizing prompts for
