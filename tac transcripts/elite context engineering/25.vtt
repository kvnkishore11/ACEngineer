504
00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.027
every single agent to

505
00:12:30.027 --> 00:12:31.346
have, okay? I have

506
00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:32.407
to keep stressing that

507
00:12:32.407 --> 00:12:33.147
because this is the

508
00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:34.547
reality of the memory

509
00:12:34.547 --> 00:12:36.005
file. It will always

510
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.225
be added. So copy

511
00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:38.686
this, we'll clean this

512
00:12:38.706 --> 00:12:40.782
up, save that, resetter

513
00:12:40.782 --> 00:12:42.561
agent here, CLD is

514
00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:43.679
an alias. You can

515
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.379
check out all the

516
00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.479
aliases I'm gonna run

517
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:46.798
throughout this lesson. At

518
00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:47.457
the bottom of the

519
00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:48.456
readme, you can see

520
00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:49.437
all the aliases right

521
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:50.475
here. All right, so

522
00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:51.674
now we have a

523
00:12:51.674 --> 00:12:53.375
concise MD file. The

524
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:54.354
warning is gone. We

525
00:12:54.354 --> 00:12:56.393
can type slash context

526
00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:57.912
and check this out.

527
00:12:58.072 --> 00:12:59.530
Our context window on

528
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.590
boot up on startup
