01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:31.381
Managing your context window

3086
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.240
is the name of

3087
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.100
the game for effective

3088
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.698
agentic coding. And remember,

3089
01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:37.198
it's not necessarily about

3090
01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.677
saving tokens. It's about

3091
01:08:38.677 --> 01:08:40.636
spending them properly. We

3092
01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:41.716
manage our context window

3093
01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:42.416
so that we don't

3094
01:08:42.416 --> 01:08:44.154
waste time and tokens

3095
01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.333
correcting our agents' mistakes.

3096
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.505
We want one-shot out-loop

3097
01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:49.845
agent decoding in a

3098
01:08:49.845 --> 01:08:51.043
massive streak with the

3099
01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:52.903
fewest attempts and large

3100
01:08:52.903 --> 01:08:54.363
sizes so we can

3101
01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.634
drop our presence. In

3102
01:08:56.634 --> 01:08:57.832
TAC, we use specialized

3103
01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.592
agents, we delegated and

3104
01:08:59.592 --> 01:09:00.832
we reduced the context
