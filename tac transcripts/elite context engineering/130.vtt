2924
01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:00.682
engineering. Okay. So we're

2925
01:05:00.682 --> 01:05:02.222
going to run this

2926
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:03.282
new Claude Code instance

2927
01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:03.922
in YOLO mode. You

2928
01:05:03.922 --> 01:05:04.802
can see that log

2929
01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.521
got appended there. Our

2930
01:05:06.521 --> 01:05:07.420
agents, right? In our

2931
01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.059
system, our agentic system

2932
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:10.039
is keeping track of

2933
01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.280
all types things now

2934
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.219
log hooks context bundles

2935
01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:13.938
we can fire off

2936
01:05:13.938 --> 01:05:14.818
background agents if we

2937
01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:15.798
want um but all

2938
01:05:15.798 --> 01:05:16.219
we want to do

2939
01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:18.277
now is expert improve

2940
01:05:18.637 --> 01:05:20.713
okay no params We

2941
01:05:20.713 --> 01:05:22.152
just improve and it

2942
01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:22.932
does this by looking

2943
01:05:22.972 --> 01:05:23.972
at the git diff.

2944
01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:24.532
It looks at any

2945
01:05:24.532 --> 01:05:25.572
changes and then it

2946
01:05:25.731 --> 01:05:27.431
makes the improvement to

2947
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:30.268
our existing build and
