828
00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.144
the response of our

829
00:19:32.144 --> 00:19:33.484
one word output style

830
00:19:33.684 --> 00:19:35.183
versus our default cloud

831
00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:36.243
code style they're both

832
00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:36.644
going to do the

833
00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:37.544
same work they're both

834
00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:38.784
going to complete and

835
00:19:38.784 --> 00:19:40.064
generate this new file

836
00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:41.284
right here but the

837
00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:42.583
difference and the output

838
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:43.383
and the difference and

839
00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.103
the consumption of tokens

840
00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:46.903
specifically the output tokens

841
00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:47.823
is going to be

842
00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:49.163
larger and we can

843
00:19:49.163 --> 00:19:50.242
look at this output

844
00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:52.143
style exactly concise done

845
00:19:52.242 --> 00:19:52.843
check this out so

846
00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:53.323
we have a you

847
00:19:53.323 --> 00:19:54.603
know list here of

848
00:19:54.643 --> 00:19:56.362
output styles and you

849
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.321
can see here we

850
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.662
are continuously reiterating this

851
00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:00.761
clock code output style
