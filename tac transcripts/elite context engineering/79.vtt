1753
00:39:29.423 --> 00:39:30.364
this now, great, who

1754
00:39:30.364 --> 00:39:31.463
cares? Let's open up

1755
00:39:31.463 --> 00:39:32.041
a new Claude Code

1756
00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:33.501
instance. And let's say

1757
00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:34.420
that this, you know,

1758
00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.858
this agent's context window

1759
00:39:35.858 --> 00:39:37.277
exploded. We can, with

1760
00:39:37.277 --> 00:39:38.697
this context bundle, run

1761
00:39:38.795 --> 00:39:41.534
slash load bundle, copy

1762
00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:42.753
the path, paste it,

1763
00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:44.771
hit enter. This agent

1764
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:45.349
is now going to

1765
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.489
get the full story

1766
00:39:46.548 --> 00:39:47.409
of the previous agent.

1767
00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:48.947
It's gonna deduplicate any

1768
00:39:48.947 --> 00:39:50.025
read commands. And then

1769
00:39:50.025 --> 00:39:51.025
it's going to create

1770
00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:52.664
an understanding of the

1771
00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:53.943
work done up till

1772
00:39:53.943 --> 00:39:55.405
this point. Okay, and

1773
00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:56.204
so imagine this is

1774
00:39:56.204 --> 00:39:57.324
much larger, right? Let's

1775
00:39:57.344 --> 00:39:58.103
say that it's something

1776
00:39:58.103 --> 00:39:59.483
like, you know, 50

1777
00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:01.101
plus lines of reads
