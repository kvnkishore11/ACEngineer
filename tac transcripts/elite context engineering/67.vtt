00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:30.363
response session ID, fantastic,

1479
00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:31.123
there we go. So

1480
00:33:31.222 --> 00:33:32.762
simple prompt, simple planner,

1481
00:33:32.762 --> 00:33:35.002
builder workflow, architect, editor,

1482
00:33:35.002 --> 00:33:36.742
delegating across two context

1483
00:33:36.762 --> 00:33:40.942
windows. Let's take our

1484
00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:42.521
builder and let's run

1485
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.961
a very well-meaning feature

1486
00:33:45.001 --> 00:33:45.821
inside of Cloud Code.

1487
00:33:45.862 --> 00:33:47.261
A very powerful, useful

1488
00:33:47.261 --> 00:33:50.150
feature slash compact. Okay,

1489
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:51.449
so you've probably used

1490
00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:52.368
this one, but there's

1491
00:33:52.368 --> 00:33:53.209
a huge problem with

1492
00:33:53.209 --> 00:33:54.907
this command. After compact

1493
00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:56.407
runs, do you know

1494
00:33:56.407 --> 00:33:58.067
exactly what's in your

1495
00:33:58.067 --> 00:33:59.807
context window every single

1496
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.885
time? Now, the answer
