00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:31.034
across tens of prompts,

929
00:21:31.114 --> 00:21:32.613
across hundreds of prompts

930
00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:34.032
and hundreds of agents,

931
00:21:34.073 --> 00:21:35.471
okay? Every piece of

932
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:37.090
context matters. When you

933
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:37.790
look at a graph

934
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.550
of this stuff, when

935
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.269
you start to see

936
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:40.949
your token consumption, you

937
00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:41.548
know this to be

938
00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:42.948
true, okay? We have

939
00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:44.188
reduced our token token

940
00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:45.366
usage here in this

941
00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:46.747
one element of Cloud

942
00:21:46.747 --> 00:21:49.385
Code down from 150.

943
00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.644
This is some massive

944
00:21:50.664 --> 00:21:53.223
99% reduction in token

945
00:21:53.223 --> 00:21:54.663
usage, okay? And it's

946
00:21:54.663 --> 00:21:55.663
all because we are

947
00:21:55.663 --> 00:21:57.781
controlling the output style

948
00:21:57.882 --> 00:21:58.922
of Claude Code with

949
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:01.240
a concise done prompt.
