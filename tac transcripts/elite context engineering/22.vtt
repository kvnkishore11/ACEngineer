437
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:01.215
performance What they're really

438
00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:02.514
saying here is There's

439
00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:03.653
a big chunk of

440
00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:04.673
state in the context

441
00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:05.812
window that will likely

442
00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:07.691
change the outcome and

443
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:08.671
deter it from the

444
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:09.830
outcome you're looking for.

445
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.549
The claw.md file is

446
00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:12.928
incredible for one reason.

447
00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:14.327
It's a reusable memory

448
00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:16.206
file that's always loaded

449
00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.647
into your agent's context

450
00:11:17.647 --> 00:11:20.285
window. Simultaneously, a claw.md

451
00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.985
file is terrible for

452
00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:23.364
the exact same reason.

453
00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:24.644
It's a reusable memory

454
00:11:24.644 --> 00:11:26.763
file that's always loaded

455
00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:27.902
into your agent's context

456
00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:28.881
window. So why is

457
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:29.701
that a problem? The

458
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.159
problem with always on
