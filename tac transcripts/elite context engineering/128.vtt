2870
01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.170
goes. Once you master

2871
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.271
the context window of

2872
01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:02.311
a single agent, you

2873
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:03.371
can make your agent

2874
01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:04.251
do more because it

2875
01:04:04.251 --> 01:04:05.090
has more space, it's

2876
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.471
focused, and then you

2877
01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:08.150
can scale up how

2878
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.750
many agents you can

2879
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.681
control and steer at

2880
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.320
any one point in

2881
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.079
time. So now we

2882
01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:15.139
have this implemented. Let's

2883
01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:15.918
see, you always wanna

2884
01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:16.998
review the work. At

2885
01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:17.579
a high level, I

2886
01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:18.257
can just quickly come

2887
01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:19.097
in here and see

2888
01:04:19.097 --> 01:04:20.297
that looks great, universal

2889
01:04:20.317 --> 01:04:21.737
logger. Okay, looks great.

2890
01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:24.115
It is adhering properly.

2891
01:04:24.335 --> 01:04:25.635
It is aligned. Now

2892
01:04:25.635 --> 01:04:26.114
if we open up

2893
01:04:26.114 --> 01:04:27.534
a new instance here

2894
01:04:27.634 --> 01:04:28.873
and kick off Claude,

2895
01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:29.733
you can see we

2896
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.371
have this feature built
