188
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.422
agents, they'll consume 2000

189
00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:01.440
tokens if they read

190
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.821
the entire file. Measuring

191
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:05.040
your context is foundational.

192
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.639
Every context engineering technique

193
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.877
we build from here

194
00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:09.218
depends on this. If

195
00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:10.456
you aren't actively paying

196
00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.716
attention to the state

197
00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:13.076
of your agent's context,

198
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.514
you're just vibe coding

199
00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.615
and you'll only be

200
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.473
able to tackle the

201
00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:18.033
lowest hanging fruit, which

202
00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:19.632
is already a massively

203
00:05:19.632 --> 00:05:21.192
saturated space. To push

204
00:05:21.192 --> 00:05:22.771
further, you must learn

205
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:23.831
to see from your

206
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.529
agent's perspective. What gets

207
00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.408
measured gets managed. So

208
00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:29.228
measure your context window.

209
00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.908
Use slash context and
