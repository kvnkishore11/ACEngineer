1976
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:30.315
at least not at

1977
00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:31.155
the time of filming,

1978
00:44:31.195 --> 00:44:31.896
okay? You have to

1979
00:44:31.896 --> 00:44:33.436
run this in print

1980
00:44:33.456 --> 00:44:35.476
mode, in programmatic mode.

1981
00:44:35.534 --> 00:44:35.954
This is where we

1982
00:44:35.954 --> 00:44:37.335
start pushing out the

1983
00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:38.235
loop. So we do

1984
00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:39.155
need this dash dash

1985
00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:40.454
print or just dash

1986
00:44:40.454 --> 00:44:41.494
P flag. And then

1987
00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:42.554
we run a prompt.

1988
00:44:42.574 --> 00:44:44.153
So I'll say, what

1989
00:44:44.153 --> 00:44:47.686
is Claude.large.md for and

1990
00:44:47.686 --> 00:44:48.306
so that was the

1991
00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:49.606
large you know context

1992
00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:50.844
file that we demoed

1993
00:44:51.005 --> 00:44:52.045
in the beginning 18

1994
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:53.664
000 tokens massive then

1995
00:44:53.664 --> 00:44:54.244
i'm going to paste

1996
00:44:54.244 --> 00:44:55.644
in this system prompt

1997
00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:56.324
and so check this

1998
00:44:56.324 --> 00:44:58.063
out important when using

1999
00:44:58.063 --> 00:44:59.543
the read tool always

2000
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.543
read in increments of
