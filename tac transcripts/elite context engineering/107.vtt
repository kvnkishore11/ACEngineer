00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.014
our background. delegated agent

2399
00:53:32.014 --> 00:53:33.393
instance is just writing

2400
00:53:33.393 --> 00:53:34.072
this plan for us.

2401
00:53:34.072 --> 00:53:35.012
There's no reason for

2402
00:53:35.012 --> 00:53:35.472
me to sit in

2403
00:53:35.472 --> 00:53:35.992
the loop. I know

2404
00:53:35.992 --> 00:53:37.371
exactly what this does.

2405
00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:38.630
And here is the

2406
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:39.811
output. Check this out,

2407
00:53:39.811 --> 00:53:41.989
progress task completed. It

2408
00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:43.789
renamed this file. I

2409
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:44.949
have an instruction to

2410
00:53:44.949 --> 00:53:46.168
rename the file when

2411
00:53:46.168 --> 00:53:49.027
it finishes, 1302.53. We

2412
00:53:49.027 --> 00:53:50.068
can click this. It

2413
00:53:50.068 --> 00:53:51.447
is now complete. A

2414
00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:53.286
very quick one prompt

2415
00:53:53.405 --> 00:53:55.137
agent delegation system It's

2416
00:53:55.157 --> 00:53:56.257
all here for you

2417
00:53:56.257 --> 00:53:57.177
in this codebase.

2418
00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:58.056
Think of these as

2419
00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.016
starting points for understanding
