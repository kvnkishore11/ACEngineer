1825
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:00.893
overflowing the next agent's

1826
00:41:00.893 --> 00:41:02.411
context window. Okay. So

1827
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:02.951
you do have to

1828
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.369
use this selectively, but

1829
00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:06.588
this gets us 70%

1830
00:41:06.588 --> 00:41:07.847
of where the previous

1831
00:41:07.847 --> 00:41:08.826
agent was. It gets

1832
00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:10.623
us mounted and restarted

1833
00:41:10.684 --> 00:41:11.563
very quickly. This is

1834
00:41:11.563 --> 00:41:13.342
another advanced contact engineering

1835
00:41:13.342 --> 00:41:14.601
technique you can use.

1836
00:41:14.601 --> 00:41:15.199
Check out this code

1837
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:16.199
base for the details

1838
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:17.538
on how exactly this

1839
00:41:17.538 --> 00:41:22.217
works. Our last advanced

1840
00:41:22.257 --> 00:41:23.657
technique is simple. It's

1841
00:41:23.657 --> 00:41:24.336
a simple idea, it's

1842
00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:25.596
a beautiful idea, continues

1843
00:41:25.596 --> 00:41:26.235
to build on the

1844
00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:27.376
techniques we've worked up

1845
00:41:27.376 --> 00:41:28.556
to use one agent

1846
00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:29.934
for one purpose. Maybe

1847
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:30.534
you've picked up on
