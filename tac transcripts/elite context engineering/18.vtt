357
00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.332
single agent instance you

358
00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.312
boot up. Okay, we're

359
00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:03.253
talking about tens and

360
00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:04.371
hundreds. And as you

361
00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:05.631
scale up, this bad

362
00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:07.571
practice will bleed into

363
00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:09.051
your leverage points of

364
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:10.509
agentic coding. Okay, they

365
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:11.860
scale all the way

366
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.990
in, your ADWs. Only

367
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.070
use these MCP servers

368
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.688
when you explicitly need

369
00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:18.568
them because they come

370
00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:22.149
with a cost. This

371
00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:22.989
technique is a bit

372
00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:25.227
controversial, especially for beginners,

373
00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:26.768
but I strongly recommend

374
00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:28.847
context priming over using

375
00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.648
a claw.md or any
