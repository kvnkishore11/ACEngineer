2371
00:52:59.364 --> 00:53:01.003
trail, this story of

2372
00:53:01.003 --> 00:53:01.664
what your agents have

2373
00:53:01.664 --> 00:53:02.844
done is an important

2374
00:53:02.963 --> 00:53:04.463
agentic pattern. We are

2375
00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:05.902
building up on every

2376
00:53:05.902 --> 00:53:07.802
context engineering technique we've

2377
00:53:07.802 --> 00:53:09.103
used thus far. This

2378
00:53:09.103 --> 00:53:10.742
agent should report back

2379
00:53:10.742 --> 00:53:11.722
to its report file

2380
00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:12.222
here. This is a

2381
00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.342
great way to track

2382
00:53:13.474 --> 00:53:14.612
the progress of your

2383
00:53:14.612 --> 00:53:15.532
agents as they work

2384
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.789
in the background. So

2385
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:17.269
you can see here,

2386
00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:17.668
we still have that

2387
00:53:17.668 --> 00:53:19.128
one background task running.

2388
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.005
We should get an

2389
00:53:20.025 --> 00:53:21.744
update here. Our agent

2390
00:53:21.744 --> 00:53:22.882
has, there we go.

2391
00:53:22.882 --> 00:53:23.302
So you can see

2392
00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:24.481
it's reading its background

2393
00:53:24.481 --> 00:53:25.860
file now. And then

2394
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.599
soon it's gonna put

2395
00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:27.418
the right in here.

2396
00:53:27.418 --> 00:53:27.936
We should see this

2397
00:53:27.936 --> 00:53:29.715
come in live as

2398
00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.014
our background. delegated agent
