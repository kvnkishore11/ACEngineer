1381
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.559
needs is inside of

1382
00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:31.539
this plan. It's all

1383
00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:32.558
there because our planner

1384
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:33.318
took care of that

1385
00:31:33.318 --> 00:31:35.157
for the builder, all

1386
00:31:35.157 --> 00:31:37.328
right? reducing context and

1387
00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:39.127
we're delegating context, right?

1388
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:39.847
You can see our

1389
00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:41.527
planner has consumed some

1390
00:31:41.527 --> 00:31:43.286
7k tokens here. We're

1391
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:43.945
in a very small

1392
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:44.766
codebase. And just

1393
00:31:44.766 --> 00:31:45.505
imagine that this is,

1394
00:31:45.505 --> 00:31:46.464
you know, a larger

1395
00:31:46.464 --> 00:31:48.003
task, right? 60,000 tokens,

1396
00:31:48.003 --> 00:31:48.824
whatever. You can be

1397
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.502
guaranteed that the tokens

1398
00:31:50.502 --> 00:31:52.061
used to plan, not

1399
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:53.061
all of that is

1400
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.560
critical for the building.

1401
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:56.101
And this makes sense.

1402
00:31:56.101 --> 00:31:57.240
When you're engineering, when

1403
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.778
you're writing plans, you

1404
00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.617
always go overboard. By
