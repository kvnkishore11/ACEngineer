225
00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:01.538
you're wasting tokens with

226
00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:02.937
MCP servers you're not

227
00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:04.416
actively using. This is

228
00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:05.976
a simple, easy beginner

229
00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:07.377
context engineering mistake to

230
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:09.276
make. Thankfully, the solution

231
00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.935
is simple. Be very

232
00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.576
purposeful with your MCP

233
00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:13.415
servers. If we open

234
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.915
up the directory here,

235
00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:15.415
you can see we

236
00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:17.134
have a variety of

237
00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:18.875
MCP servers. Inside of

238
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.855
the .mcp.json file, we

239
00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:21.915
have a bad practice

240
00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.353
of context engineering inside

241
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:23.994
of this codebase.

242
00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:25.394
We have a default

243
00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:27.425
.mcp.json file that is

244
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:29.504
always loading into the

245
00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:30.625
context window of our
