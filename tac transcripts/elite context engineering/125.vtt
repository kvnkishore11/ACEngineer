2800
01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:30.737
right? This is a

2801
01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.715
classic pattern. Big shout

2802
01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:33.936
out to the legacy

2803
01:02:33.936 --> 01:02:35.315
AI coding tools, the

2804
01:02:35.315 --> 01:02:36.893
old school tools, Ader,

2805
01:02:36.914 --> 01:02:37.554
and all the other

2806
01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.793
tools that separated planning

2807
01:02:39.793 --> 01:02:40.572
and building. This is

2808
01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:41.291
a pattern that is

2809
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.331
going to continue across.

2810
01:02:43.331 --> 01:02:44.090
And as you saw

2811
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.329
in TAC, this pattern

2812
01:02:45.489 --> 01:02:46.750
can continue and expand

2813
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.309
across the software developer

2814
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:49.967
lifecycle. Here's our new

2815
01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.447
hook logger getting built

2816
01:02:51.447 --> 01:02:53.407
out, CHMOD. It has

2817
01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:54.826
everything it needs you

2818
01:02:54.826 --> 01:02:56.385
deploy this into single

2819
01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:57.164
file scripts, right? It

2820
01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.543
has the information, it

2821
01:02:58.543 --> 01:02:59.802
is an expert. I've

2822
01:02:59.862 --> 01:03:01.860
built an expert set
