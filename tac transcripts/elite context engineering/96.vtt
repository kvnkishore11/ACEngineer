2139
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:00.211
a time of the

2140
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.630
Claude Code Hooks directory,

2141
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.190
For this one, it

2142
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.148
needed to read more

2143
00:48:03.148 --> 00:48:04.248
to accomplish this task,

2144
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:05.327
so it did. I

2145
00:48:05.327 --> 00:48:07.347
recommend you only use

2146
00:48:07.347 --> 00:48:08.586
this agentic level context

2147
00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:10.005
engineering technique when nothing

2148
00:48:10.005 --> 00:48:11.324
else works or when

2149
00:48:11.324 --> 00:48:12.065
you start building your

2150
00:48:12.105 --> 00:48:13.724
custom agents for your

2151
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.963
domain specific use cases

2152
00:48:14.963 --> 00:48:15.722
and when you start

2153
00:48:15.722 --> 00:48:17.302
deploying agents inside of

2154
00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.202
your codebase. Check

2155
00:48:18.202 --> 00:48:19.541
out the agentic horizon

2156
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.820
extended lesson on cloud

2157
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.960
code SDK mastery. There

2158
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.699
we break down the

2159
00:48:24.699 --> 00:48:26.237
Claude Code SDK so

2160
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:26.777
that you can run

2161
00:48:26.777 --> 00:48:27.438
this in a more

2162
00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:29.217
programmatic way so you

2163
00:48:29.217 --> 00:48:30.795
can build out specific
