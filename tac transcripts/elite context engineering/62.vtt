1356
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:00.340
future, I hope you

1357
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.299
have better, more powerful

1358
00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:02.857
models, use that. These

1359
00:31:02.877 --> 00:31:04.217
techniques are all the

1360
00:31:04.217 --> 00:31:05.576
same across models. Don't

1361
00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:06.194
get stuck up on

1362
00:31:06.234 --> 00:31:07.733
any one individual model,

1363
00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:08.333
but you can see

1364
00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.632
here our planner has

1365
00:31:09.632 --> 00:31:10.930
finished planning. Now we

1366
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.229
can just copy this

1367
00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:12.808
and we can be

1368
00:31:12.808 --> 00:31:14.027
very confident that whatever

1369
00:31:14.027 --> 00:31:15.425
is in here is

1370
00:31:15.586 --> 00:31:16.365
up to par with

1371
00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:17.964
our standards because we've

1372
00:31:17.984 --> 00:31:20.104
put upfront investment into

1373
00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:21.523
our planning phase. So

1374
00:31:21.523 --> 00:31:22.202
I can just copy

1375
00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:23.083
the reference to this

1376
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:23.663
and go to our

1377
00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:25.162
build agent, paste this

1378
00:31:25.162 --> 00:31:26.261
in, and with no

1379
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:27.520
context priming at all,

1380
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.941
everything the build agent

1381
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.559
needs is inside of
