1732
00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:01.878
additional read commands and

1733
00:39:01.878 --> 00:39:03.139
we're getting a log

1734
00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:03.938
right we're getting a

1735
00:39:03.938 --> 00:39:06.237
full-on context bundle of

1736
00:39:06.237 --> 00:39:08.797
our agents context window

1737
00:39:08.938 --> 00:39:09.757
Okay, this is a

1738
00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:12.036
very simple yet powerful

1739
00:39:12.036 --> 00:39:12.855
idea you can use

1740
00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:14.534
to remount instances to

1741
00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:15.193
get them into the

1742
00:39:15.193 --> 00:39:17.192
exact same state after

1743
00:39:17.192 --> 00:39:18.552
their context window has

1744
00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:19.731
exploded. It also gives

1745
00:39:19.731 --> 00:39:21.170
us a story because

1746
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.969
we have the prompt

1747
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:23.628
operation in here about

1748
00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:25.027
what the context is

1749
00:39:25.027 --> 00:39:26.186
and why the context

1750
00:39:26.186 --> 00:39:27.166
is that way based

1751
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.065
on our user prompt.

1752
00:39:28.105 --> 00:39:29.423
Okay, so we have

1753
00:39:29.423 --> 00:39:30.364
this now, great, who
