1250
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:32.317
a powerful classic pattern.

1251
00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:36.417
We're continuing to push

1252
00:28:36.417 --> 00:28:38.136
into the delegation side

1253
00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:39.435
of the R&D framework.

1254
00:28:39.435 --> 00:28:40.496
You can have two

1255
00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:42.214
agents working side by

1256
00:28:42.214 --> 00:28:43.933
side. One agent plans,

1257
00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.433
the other agent executes

1258
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:46.153
the plan. You have

1259
00:28:46.153 --> 00:28:47.272
a planner and a

1260
00:28:47.272 --> 00:28:49.011
builder, an architect and

1261
00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:49.751
an editor. This is

1262
00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:51.851
a classic prompt chaining

1263
00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:53.269
technique that expands and

1264
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:55.749
extrapolates very well into

1265
00:28:55.749 --> 00:28:57.048
the age of agents

1266
00:28:57.167 --> 00:28:57.988
with your Claude Code

1267
00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.028
agents and with any

1268
00:28:59.028 --> 00:28:59.926
agent. We have a

1269
00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:00.866
reusable prompt in this
