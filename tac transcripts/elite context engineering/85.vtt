1892
00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:31.800
AI developer workflow, the

1893
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.699
highest level of agentic

1894
00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.599
coding leverage as discussed

1895
00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.719
in TAC. We'll move

1896
00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:37.297
on from this big

1897
00:42:37.297 --> 00:42:38.597
idea since it's the

1898
00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:40.056
key idea in TAC

1899
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:40.936
Lesson 6, but this

1900
00:42:40.936 --> 00:42:42.416
is a massive way

1901
00:42:42.416 --> 00:42:43.974
to manage your context

1902
00:42:43.974 --> 00:42:45.574
windows. This idea takes

1903
00:42:45.594 --> 00:42:46.914
agent delegation to its

1904
00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:49.592
natural, most valuable limit.

1905
00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:50.831
Use one agent for

1906
00:42:50.851 --> 00:42:52.231
one purpose so that

1907
00:42:52.231 --> 00:42:53.771
your context windows are

1908
00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.650
focused. A focused agent

1909
00:42:55.769 --> 00:42:57.168
is a performant agent.
