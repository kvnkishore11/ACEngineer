148
00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.082
have some context problems

149
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:01.322
already that we'll work

150
00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:02.042
through. You can type

151
00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:04.241
slash context and see

152
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.080
all the context in

153
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.800
our agent's context window.

154
00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.318
This is your most

155
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.518
important tool for measuring

156
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.968
and therefore managing your

157
00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.088
context window. It shows

158
00:04:14.088 --> 00:04:15.149
you exactly how much

159
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.608
stuff your agent will

160
00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:18.326
work through with every

161
00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:19.966
prompt execution. You can

162
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:20.826
see here we are

163
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.209
absolutely torching or clawed

164
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:24.348
opus tokens. We have

165
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.586
63K tokens already spent

166
00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:28.747
on boot up. If

167
00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:29.826
you never run slash

168
00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.225
context, you will not
