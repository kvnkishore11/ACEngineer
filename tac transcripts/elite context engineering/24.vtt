480
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:01.902
gonna have contradictory information

481
00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:02.961
inside of your context

482
00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:03.639
window. That is the

483
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.938
worst possible case, and

484
00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:06.236
this will happen if

485
00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:07.336
you just keep growing

486
00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:08.275
your memory file. All

487
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.254
right, so what's the

488
00:12:09.254 --> 00:12:10.750
solution here? The solution

489
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.649
is context priming. Let's

490
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.969
trim down, right? Let's

491
00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:15.788
use this flaw.concise, right?

492
00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:16.849
It's a lot simpler.

493
00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:17.708
It's something that we

494
00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:18.969
always want to add,

495
00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:19.668
you know, and take

496
00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:20.089
a look at this,

497
00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:21.408
right? It's only 43

498
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.548
lines and it's just

499
00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:23.187
got some, you know,

500
00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:24.988
mock structure for this

501
00:12:24.988 --> 00:12:26.107
codebase. And these

502
00:12:26.107 --> 00:12:27.207
are just some things

503
00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:28.628
that we always want

504
00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.027
every single agent to
