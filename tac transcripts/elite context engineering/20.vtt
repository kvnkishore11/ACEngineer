396
00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:01.256
we have this error

397
00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:02.496
message. Let's address this

398
00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:03.696
now, okay? We have

399
00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:05.274
built up a massive,

400
00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:06.235
and I mean massive,

401
00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.894
claw.md file. If we

402
00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:09.073
run slash context once

403
00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:11.113
again and monitor what's

404
00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:12.052
going on here, we

405
00:10:12.052 --> 00:10:12.772
have cleaned up our

406
00:10:12.772 --> 00:10:14.010
MCP servers, but we

407
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.331
haven't cleaned up is

408
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.009
this massive memory file.

409
00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:18.749
We have a 23,000

410
00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:20.467
token memory file, again,

411
00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:21.508
showing up about 10%

412
00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:23.647
of our entire context

413
00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:25.745
window of expensive Opus

414
00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:27.264
tokens. I'm of course

415
00:10:27.264 --> 00:10:29.663
exaggerating my claw.md file

416
00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.024
here just to showcase
