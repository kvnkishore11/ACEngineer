1654
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:31.007
we've been using context

1655
00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:32.586
bundles the entire time.

1656
00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:33.786
So let's collapse everything

1657
00:37:33.786 --> 00:37:35.617
and open up agents

1658
00:37:35.637 --> 00:37:36.858
and so agents is

1659
00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:38.697
becoming a additional agentic

1660
00:37:38.697 --> 00:37:40.476
layer directory where you

1661
00:37:40.476 --> 00:37:41.516
can just put output

1662
00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:43.036
from operations of your

1663
00:37:43.036 --> 00:37:43.817
agents. You can see

1664
00:37:43.817 --> 00:37:44.755
we have background and

1665
00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:45.856
we have context bundles.

1666
00:37:45.856 --> 00:37:46.956
Let's click into bundles

1667
00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:47.735
and let's see what

1668
00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:48.695
we have in this

1669
00:37:48.695 --> 00:37:49.976
directory. All right, so

1670
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:50.896
if we click this

1671
00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:51.914
bundle, we have something

1672
00:37:51.914 --> 00:37:52.855
super simple. We have

1673
00:37:52.855 --> 00:37:53.974
slash prime and we

1674
00:37:53.974 --> 00:37:54.954
have read. If we

1675
00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:56.735
click into this context

1676
00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:57.494
bundle, you can see

1677
00:37:57.494 --> 00:37:58.414
we have our quick

1678
00:37:58.414 --> 00:37:59.634
plan. So this was

1679
00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:00.514
the work that happened
