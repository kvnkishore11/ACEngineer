2270
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.159
paste this in, and

2271
00:51:00.159 --> 00:51:00.679
this is going to

2272
00:51:00.679 --> 00:51:01.938
kick off a new

2273
00:51:02.239 --> 00:51:03.038
quick plan. So we're

2274
00:51:03.038 --> 00:51:04.916
running that plan workflow,

2275
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.235
that plan agentic prompt

2276
00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:07.215
again. This time we're

2277
00:51:07.215 --> 00:51:08.155
building out a cloud

2278
00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:09.094
code. These are just

2279
00:51:09.094 --> 00:51:10.652
random code examples. We're

2280
00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:11.253
going to read a

2281
00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:11.773
couple of pieces of

2282
00:51:11.773 --> 00:51:13.132
documentation and this time

2283
00:51:13.132 --> 00:51:14.411
we're building out a

2284
00:51:14.411 --> 00:51:16.382
astral UV Claude Code,

2285
00:51:16.382 --> 00:51:17.621
Python SDK with that

2286
00:51:17.621 --> 00:51:19.000
same format, right? Those

2287
00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:20.219
three files by Dantic

2288
00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:21.557
types, low level files,

2289
00:51:21.557 --> 00:51:23.295
CLI file, right? Specifying

2290
00:51:23.295 --> 00:51:23.996
where to create it.

2291
00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:24.934
This is the plan.

2292
00:51:25.434 --> 00:51:26.193
Let's fire it off.

2293
00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:26.813
This is going to

2294
00:51:26.813 --> 00:51:28.393
kick off a background

2295
00:51:28.432 --> 00:51:30.190
agent. Okay. And so
