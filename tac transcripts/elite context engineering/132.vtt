2972
01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:00.351
improve. There we go.

2973
01:06:00.532 --> 01:06:02.469
I've identified several changes

2974
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.148
relevant learnings, relevant changes

2975
01:06:04.148 --> 01:06:05.148
from the universal log

2976
01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:06.507
implementation. That looks great.

2977
01:06:06.568 --> 01:06:07.168
If your codebase

2978
01:06:07.168 --> 01:06:07.927
is large or you

2979
01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:09.286
have a highly technical

2980
01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:11.606
area that requires your

2981
01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:13.425
expertise or another engineers

2982
01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:14.085
on your team, you

2983
01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:15.503
know, I highly recommend

2984
01:06:15.563 --> 01:06:17.282
using the agent experts

2985
01:06:17.282 --> 01:06:18.382
pattern. Of course, you'll

2986
01:06:18.382 --> 01:06:19.442
have to maintain and

2987
01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.181
monitor your expert, but

2988
01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:21.920
this is much better

2989
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.880
than having it stuck

2990
01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:23.760
in your head or

2991
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.659
an engineer's head, right?

2992
01:06:24.659 --> 01:06:26.478
You want your agentic

2993
01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:27.677
layer operating your code

2994
01:06:27.677 --> 01:06:29.057
base and you operate

2995
01:06:29.057 --> 01:06:30.077
the agentic layer, right?
