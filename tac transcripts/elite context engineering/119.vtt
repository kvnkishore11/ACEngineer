2662
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:30.168
the agent that runs

2663
00:59:30.168 --> 00:59:30.947
this prompt, as you

2664
00:59:30.947 --> 00:59:31.947
can imagine, is gonna

2665
00:59:31.947 --> 00:59:33.987
be specialized to running

2666
00:59:34.146 --> 00:59:35.626
Claude Code hooks, right?

2667
00:59:35.626 --> 00:59:36.385
You can even see

2668
00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:37.905
directory structure all the

2669
00:59:37.905 --> 00:59:39.726
relevant files to this

2670
00:59:39.744 --> 00:59:41.445
specific piece of our

2671
00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:42.704
codebase right you

2672
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:43.644
can see here we're

2673
00:59:43.644 --> 00:59:45.565
building experts we're not

2674
00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:48.003
building random one-off agents

2675
00:59:48.003 --> 00:59:49.844
random agent instances we've

2676
00:59:49.844 --> 00:59:51.103
built a reasonable prompt

2677
00:59:51.103 --> 00:59:52.503
that mounts and you

2678
00:59:52.503 --> 00:59:53.543
know to echo all

2679
00:59:53.543 --> 00:59:53.983
the way back to

2680
00:59:53.983 --> 00:59:55.523
our beginner techniques we

2681
00:59:55.523 --> 00:59:56.123
are in a way

2682
00:59:56.123 --> 00:59:57.742
priming this agent to

2683
00:59:57.742 --> 00:59:59.043
be an expert at

2684
00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.922
this area of focus
