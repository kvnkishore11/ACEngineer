our existing build and

2948
01:05:30.369 --> 01:05:31.869
plan Claude Code hook

2949
01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:32.967

2950
01:05:32.967 --> 01:05:33.987
base. Okay, so you're

2951
01:05:33.987 --> 01:05:34.827

been done. It's gonna

2957
01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.403

the prompts of course

2965
01:05:51.139 --> 01:05:51.978
in this codebase,

2966
01:05:51.978 --> 01:05:53.797
classic, great agentic prompt

2967
01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:54.835
