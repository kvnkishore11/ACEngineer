1043
00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.736
with clock of sub

1044
00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:01.776
agents. We can delegate

1045
00:24:01.776 --> 00:24:03.096
work off of our

1046
00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:05.275
primary agents context window.

1047
00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:06.515
This is a massive

1048
00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:08.094
point for the D

1049
00:24:08.094 --> 00:24:08.913
and the R and

1050
00:24:08.913 --> 00:24:10.563
D framework, right? It's

1051
00:24:10.563 --> 00:24:12.298
delegation. We are keeping

1052
00:24:12.298 --> 00:24:13.753
context out of our

1053
00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:15.250
primary agents context window.

1054
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.207
For example, we can

1055
00:24:16.207 --> 00:24:18.384
run slash load AI

1056
00:24:18.384 --> 00:24:19.605
docs. And so this

1057
00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:20.344
is going to load

1058
00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:22.762
AI documentation from our

1059
00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:23.782
AI docs readme. It's

1060
00:24:23.782 --> 00:24:24.701
gonna read through all

1061
00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:25.701
of these items. We

1062
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:27.020
can load up the

1063
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.401
AI docs reusable prompt

1064
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.019
and it's going to

1065
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.299
kick off sub agents
