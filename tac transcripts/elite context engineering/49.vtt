1065
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.299
kick off sub agents

1066
00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:30.699
to do this work

1067
00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:31.719
for us. So our

1068
00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:32.798
primary agents reading this

1069
00:24:32.798 --> 00:24:33.518
file and it's gonna

1070
00:24:33.518 --> 00:24:34.897
kick off however many

1071
00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:36.356
agents we need to

1072
00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:37.695
to fetch every one

1073
00:24:37.695 --> 00:24:38.875
of our AI doc

1074
00:24:39.016 --> 00:24:40.035
URLs, right? So it

1075
00:24:40.035 --> 00:24:40.535
looks like, I don't

1076
00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:40.894
know, what do we

1077
00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:41.594
have here, 10 or

1078
00:24:41.594 --> 00:24:42.534
11? You can see

1079
00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:43.034
this is gonna get

1080
00:24:43.034 --> 00:24:43.772
kicked up here pretty

1081
00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:44.673
soon after we do

1082
00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:45.832
a date check on

1083
00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:46.821
any file here that's

1084
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:47.671
old than 24 hours,

1085
00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:48.490
which I think all

1086
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:48.950
of them are at

1087
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.868
this point. And so

1088
00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:50.508
you can see it's

1089
00:24:50.567 --> 00:24:51.886
removing these and then

1090
00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:52.605
it's going to fire

1091
00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:53.924
up these agents to

1092
00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:55.883
reload our AI docs.

1093
00:24:55.922 --> 00:24:56.622
There it is, doc

1094
00:24:56.622 --> 00:24:57.641
scraper. And this is

1095
00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:58.858
critical, right? A web

1096
00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.678
scrape can consume quite
