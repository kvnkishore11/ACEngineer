2822
01:02:59.862 --> 01:03:01.860
built an expert set

2823
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.239
of agent prompts into

2824
01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.699
the codebase, okay?

2825
01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:05.518
This is what it

2826
01:03:05.518 --> 01:03:07.016
looks like to continuously

2827
01:03:07.097 --> 01:03:08.516
build and improve on

2828
01:03:08.516 --> 01:03:09.835
the agentic layer of

2829
01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:10.833
your codebase. You're

2830
01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:11.652
going to end up

2831
01:03:11.773 --> 01:03:14.092
with experts, okay? Agent

2832
01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:15.550
experts that can remember

2833
01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.188
and build and improve

2834
01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:18.048
on areas of your

2835
01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:18.907
codebase that you

2836
01:03:19.068 --> 01:03:21.686
will not remember anymore,

2837
01:03:21.686 --> 01:03:22.405
okay? you know, even

2838
01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:23.764
the best engineers, you

2839
01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:24.903
know, we just lose

2840
01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:26.083
track of this stuff

2841
01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.121
over time, all right?

2842
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:28.280
That's natural. But now

2843
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.639
we have agent experts.

2844
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.559
And yes, this is
