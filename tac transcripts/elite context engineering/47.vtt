1021
00:23:29.478 --> 00:23:30.278
is that when you're

1022
00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:32.057
working with sub agents,

1023
00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:33.036
you are working with

1024
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:35.214
system prompts, okay? There

1025
00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:36.453
is a massive difference

1026
00:23:36.453 --> 00:23:37.932
between the system prompt

1027
00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:39.692
and a user prompt,

1028
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:40.611
right? When you're prompting

1029
00:23:40.611 --> 00:23:42.109
Claude Code, you're writing

1030
00:23:42.261 --> 00:23:43.442
user prompts when you're

1031
00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:45.280
building reusable custom slash

1032
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.760
commands, you're writing a

1033
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.039
user prompt that all

1034
00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:48.980
gets passed right into

1035
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.160
the agent. This is

1036
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.098
a system prompt, which

1037
00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:51.939
is nice because it

1038
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:52.919
means that it's not

1039
00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:54.218
directly added to our

1040
00:23:54.218 --> 00:23:56.137
primary agents context window.

1041
00:23:56.157 --> 00:23:57.856
Okay. And this advantage

1042
00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.797
of sub agents continues

1043
00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.736
with clock of sub
