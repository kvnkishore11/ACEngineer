333
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.084
this specialized agent focused

334
00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:31.043
on just this one

335
00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:32.202
MCP server, all right?

336
00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:33.201
And if you do

337
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:34.760
need every single MCP

338
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.500
server, explicitly reference it,

339
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.457
be very conscious with

340
00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:39.976
the state going into

341
00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:41.436
your context window. There

342
00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:42.495
are many places to

343
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:44.094
be wasteful as an

344
00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:45.677
engineer, to move fast

345
00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:46.817
and break things. The

346
00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:48.157
context window of your

347
00:08:48.157 --> 00:08:49.916
agents is not one

348
00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:51.255
of them. Here, we

349
00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:51.995
are of course using

350
00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.315
the R in the

351
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:54.615
R and D framework.

352
00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.294
We are reducing. So

353
00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:57.153
you might think this

354
00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:57.653
is not a big

355
00:08:57.653 --> 00:08:58.474
deal, but you have

356
00:08:58.474 --> 00:08:59.693
to think about every

357
00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.332
single agent instance you
