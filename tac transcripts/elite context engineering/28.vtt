573
00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:00.193
structure of the code

574
00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:00.874
base. And now if

575
00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.614
we type context, our

576
00:14:02.614 --> 00:14:03.793
agent, has a little

577
00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:05.232
bit of information about

578
00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.592
this codebase for

579
00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:08.692
this specific problem set.

580
00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:09.491
And so this problem

581
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:10.371
set is of course,

582
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:11.851
just getting a general

583
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.870
understanding of our code

584
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.990
base. So instead of

585
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.331
relying on a static

586
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:17.629
always loaded memory file,

587
00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:19.250
we're using context priming

588
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.969
to gain full control

589
00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.769
over the initial context

590
00:14:22.969 --> 00:14:23.888
of our agents. This

591
00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:25.368
is very powerful. Unlike

592
00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:26.488
the memory file, we

593
00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:28.067
can prime against several

594
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.047
different areas of focus
