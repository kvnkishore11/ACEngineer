00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.590
boot up on startup

529
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.533
is looking Much, much

530
00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:04.932
better, 92% free. What's

531
00:13:04.932 --> 00:13:06.251
left, right? Our small

532
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.230
memory file is down

533
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.269
to 0.2%, right? 350

534
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:10.690
tokens, this is great.

535
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.589
This is a clear

536
00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:13.249
focus agent. Now, what

537
00:13:13.249 --> 00:13:14.548
do we use instead

538
00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:16.386
of this large memory

539
00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:18.306
file? We should context

540
00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:19.105
prime. What does that

541
00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:19.605
mean? Let me show

542
00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:21.445
you, slash prime, and

543
00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:22.563
we hit enter. Context

544
00:13:22.563 --> 00:13:23.423
priming is when you

545
00:13:23.423 --> 00:13:25.123
use a dedicated reusable

546
00:13:25.123 --> 00:13:27.221
prompt, AKA a custom

547
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:28.701
slash command, to set

548
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:29.961
up your agent's initial

549
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:32.279
context window specifically for
