2025
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.851
agent has been modified,

2026
00:45:30.891 --> 00:45:31.831
right? We have modified

2027
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:32.929
the system prompt, we

2028
00:45:32.929 --> 00:45:34.728
are controlling this agent

2029
00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:35.989
at a lower, more

2030
00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:37.668
foundational level. Okay. The

2031
00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.067
system prompt really lets

2032
00:45:39.067 --> 00:45:40.487
you start controlling how

2033
00:45:40.487 --> 00:45:41.646
your agent behaves and

2034
00:45:41.666 --> 00:45:42.346
when you control the

2035
00:45:42.346 --> 00:45:43.704
behavior, you control the

2036
00:45:43.704 --> 00:45:45.184
context window. So let's

2037
00:45:45.184 --> 00:45:45.704
make sure I end

2038
00:45:45.704 --> 00:45:46.483
the quote here and

2039
00:45:46.483 --> 00:45:47.643
let's fire this off.

2040
00:45:47.702 --> 00:45:48.302
You can see here,

2041
00:45:48.302 --> 00:45:49.143
we have a concise

2042
00:45:49.143 --> 00:45:51.041
response demonstrates what not

2043
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:52.641
to do with project

2044
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:55.039
documentation intentionally bloated using

2045
00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:56.938
anti-pattern of over contextualization,

2046
00:45:56.938 --> 00:45:58.137
cramming excessive details, blah,

2047
00:45:58.137 --> 00:45:59.177
blah, blah. Okay. So

2048
00:45:59.177 --> 00:46:00.496
it understood it ran.
