309
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:01.206
in just the Firecrawl

310
00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:02.565
MCP server, and I've

311
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:03.685
self fixed it with

312
00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:04.685
4K. So I know

313
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.225
exactly how many tokens

314
00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.264
are going to get

315
00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:08.403
consumed by default every

316
00:08:08.403 --> 00:08:09.141
time. Okay, so I

317
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:10.081
can copy the path

318
00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:11.160
to this, paste that

319
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.038
there. And if you

320
00:08:12.038 --> 00:08:13.218
do have some globals

321
00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:14.235
that you wanna overwrite,

322
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:15.314
you can use dash

323
00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:17.333
dash strict MCP config,

324
00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.132
and then you can

325
00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:19.151
fire this off and

326
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:20.170
check this out. When

327
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.689
we run slash context,

328
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.689
we're only going to

329
00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:24.149
get that 6K tokens

330
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:25.887
strictly from the Firecrawl

331
00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.326
MCP server. And now

332
00:08:27.326 --> 00:08:28.045
we can kick off

333
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.084
this specialized agent focused
