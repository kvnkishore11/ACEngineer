3104
01:08:59.592 --> 01:09:00.832
we reduced the context

3105
01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.252
window of our agents

3106
01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:04.390
by building specialized ADWs

3107
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.791
that shipped on our

3108
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.189
behalf. So the big

3109
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.029
idea here is simple.

3110
01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.449
It's measure and manage

3111
01:09:09.489 --> 01:09:10.050
one of the most

3112
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:11.828
obviously critical leverage points

3113
01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:13.009
of agentic coding, your

3114
01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:14.547
agent's context window. Here

3115
01:09:14.547 --> 01:09:15.887
are a few future

3116
01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:17.606
context engineering trends you

3117
01:09:17.606 --> 01:09:18.487
can bet on coming

3118
01:09:18.506 --> 01:09:19.447
out of the big

3119
01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:20.746
AI labs. You can

3120
01:09:20.746 --> 01:09:22.386
imagine a larger context

3121
01:09:22.386 --> 01:09:23.444
windows. All right, this

3122
01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:24.984
is obvious and self-explanatory.

3123
01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:26.623
We want more context

3124
01:09:26.644 --> 01:09:27.983
to get around the

3125
01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:30.061
compact problem. Right next
