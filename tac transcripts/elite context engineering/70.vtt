1545
00:34:58.728 --> 00:35:00.606
cannot fit any additional

1546
00:35:00.606 --> 00:35:02.485
information. Instead of compacting,

1547
00:35:02.605 --> 00:35:03.804
instead of running slash

1548
00:35:03.804 --> 00:35:05.282
compact, I recommend you

1549
00:35:05.282 --> 00:35:09.139
run slash clear. Blow

1550
00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:10.298
away the context window

1551
00:35:10.378 --> 00:35:11.802
completely. Now if we

1552
00:35:11.802 --> 00:35:13.641
run slash context, we

1553
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:15.260
are running a fresh

1554
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.639
focused agent. Now reset

1555
00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:19.418
with slash prime, right?

1556
00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:20.797
Run whatever prime command

1557
00:35:20.797 --> 00:35:22.996
you're running and refocus

1558
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:24.215
on your task at

1559
00:35:24.215 --> 00:35:25.396
hand, right? Build back

1560
00:35:25.396 --> 00:35:25.875
up to where you

1561
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:27.733
were and continue forward.

1562
00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:28.253
I know this one

1563
00:35:28.253 --> 00:35:29.333
doesn't sound great. It's

1564
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.452
like the first advanced
