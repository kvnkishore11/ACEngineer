it understood it ran.

2049
00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:01.657
The interesting part here

2050
00:46:01.657 --> 00:46:02.896
is how it ran.

2051
00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:04.054
If we open up

2052
00:46:04.215 --> 00:46:06.152
our context bundle and

2053
00:46:06.152 --> 00:46:07.251
we go to this

2054
00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.728
context bundle that just

2055
00:46:08.728 --> 00:46:09.547
ran you can see

2056
00:46:09.547 --> 00:46:11.505
something really powerful Okay,

2057
00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:12.324
what is this file

2058
00:46:12.324 --> 00:46:12.844
for? You can see

2059
00:46:12.844 --> 00:46:13.605
our prompt and you

2060
00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.063
can see the subsequent

2061
00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:16.802
reads. Read 100, read

2062
00:46:16.802 --> 00:46:18.123
100. This agent is

2063
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:20.302
obeying the specific instructions

2064
00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:21.501
in our system prompt.

2065
00:46:21.501 --> 00:46:22.541
We're saying read 100

2066
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:23.320
lines at a time.

2067
00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:24.360
If you have enough

2068
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.739
information, stop executing and

2069
00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:28.237
respond, right? Proceed with

2070
00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:29.338
the task. This is

2071
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:30.976
super, super powerful. We've
