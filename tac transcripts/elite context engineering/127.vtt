2844
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.559
And yes, this is

2845
01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.318
another, you know, investment

2846
01:03:32.318 --> 01:03:32.876
you have to make

2847
01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:33.617
into your codebase,

2848
01:03:33.617 --> 01:03:34.775
you have to maintain

2849
01:03:34.896 --> 01:03:36.215
your agent experts, but

2850
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:36.974
this is going to

2851
01:03:36.974 --> 01:03:37.853
be, it looks like

2852
01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:38.733
our hooks are coming

2853
01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:39.431
in now. Let's go

2854
01:03:39.492 --> 01:03:40.670
ahead and look at

2855
01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.713
agents hook log. And

2856
01:03:42.713 --> 01:03:43.414
you can see there,

2857
01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:44.273
there's a couple of

2858
01:03:44.273 --> 01:03:45.253
test runs coming in.

2859
01:03:45.253 --> 01:03:45.733
It looks like this

2860
01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:46.753
agent is starting to

2861
01:03:46.753 --> 01:03:47.853
validate their own work

2862
01:03:47.952 --> 01:03:49.193
with a closed loop

2863
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:50.072
prompt. You can just

2864
01:03:50.072 --> 01:03:50.572
start to see this

2865
01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:51.592
stuff stack up very

2866
01:03:51.592 --> 01:03:53.391
quickly. Okay, so this

2867
01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:55.452
has been elite context

2868
01:03:55.572 --> 01:03:56.992
engineering, all right? This

2869
01:03:56.992 --> 01:03:57.572
is where it all

2870
01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.170
goes. Once you master
