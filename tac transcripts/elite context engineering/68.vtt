1496
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.885
time? Now, the answer

1497
00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:01.405
to this is of

1498
00:34:01.405 --> 00:34:03.384
course, no. You don't

1499
00:34:03.384 --> 00:34:04.345
know, I don't know.

1500
00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:04.724
We have to hit

1501
00:34:04.724 --> 00:34:06.763
Control R and reread

1502
00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:08.702
through what this compact

1503
00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:09.742
ended up doing. When

1504
00:34:09.742 --> 00:34:10.460
you get to advanced

1505
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.840
agent decoding, it's time

1506
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.300
to stop guessing and

1507
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.918
start knowing. I avoid

1508
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:16.257
compact and I recommend

1509
00:34:16.257 --> 00:34:17.556
that you reset and

1510
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:18.476
prime. You know, we

1511
00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:19.235
can hit Control R

1512
00:34:19.235 --> 00:34:20.215
here. We can see

1513
00:34:20.215 --> 00:34:21.735
a decent summary here,

1514
00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:22.914
right? Some nine step

1515
00:34:22.914 --> 00:34:24.193
summary. You can imagine

1516
00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:25.152
the Claude Code engineers

1517
00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:25.833
have some type of

1518
00:34:25.833 --> 00:34:27.492
prompt that generates a

1519
00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:29.391
step-by-step workflow. You can

1520
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.590
see it is summarizing.
