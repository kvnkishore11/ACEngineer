1453
00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:00.074
in this directory. All

1454
00:33:00.074 --> 00:33:00.472
right, so just a

1455
00:33:00.472 --> 00:33:01.373
simple kind of high

1456
00:33:01.373 --> 00:33:02.452
mid-level prompt and our

1457
00:33:02.452 --> 00:33:03.852
builder has finished implementing.

1458
00:33:03.852 --> 00:33:04.711
We can just open

1459
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.711
up this directory and

1460
00:33:05.711 --> 00:33:06.391
we can see exactly

1461
00:33:06.391 --> 00:33:07.509
what was created. There's

1462
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:09.189
our hello calls and

1463
00:33:09.189 --> 00:33:09.969
then inside of this

1464
00:33:09.969 --> 00:33:10.929
directory, you can see

1465
00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:11.867
here we have a

1466
00:33:11.867 --> 00:33:13.188
full on application built

1467
00:33:13.188 --> 00:33:13.727
out. We can of

1468
00:33:13.727 --> 00:33:15.925
course, TD apps, CC,

1469
00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:17.984
bun run tab. There's

1470
00:33:17.984 --> 00:33:19.763
everything our bun ecosystem

1471
00:33:19.763 --> 00:33:20.824
is giving us. we

1472
00:33:20.824 --> 00:33:22.044
can just run, run

1473
00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:22.983
dev, looks like a

1474
00:33:22.983 --> 00:33:25.124
media prompt, hello, enter,

1475
00:33:25.124 --> 00:33:25.784
and now the Cloud

1476
00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:27.563
Code SDK via TypeScript

1477
00:33:27.603 --> 00:33:28.262
is running. There's the

1478
00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:30.363
response session ID, fantastic,
