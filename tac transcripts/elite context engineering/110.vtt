2463
00:54:59.293 --> 00:55:01.233
agent task and multi-agent

2464
00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:03.211
delegation is super important

2465
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:04.192
because it gets you

2466
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:05.911
out the loop. This

2467
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:06.851
is a big idea

2468
00:55:06.851 --> 00:55:08.269
we discuss in TAC

2469
00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:09.688
and it extends into

2470
00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:11.507
context engineering. Get out

2471
00:55:11.507 --> 00:55:12.467
the loop, set up

2472
00:55:12.467 --> 00:55:14.686
many focused agents that

2473
00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:16.565
do one thing extraordinarily

2474
00:55:16.565 --> 00:55:18.188
well. In a lot

2475
00:55:18.188 --> 00:55:20.284
of ways, multi-agent delegation

2476
00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:21.922
is just like sub-agents,

2477
00:55:21.922 --> 00:55:23.041
but we get complete

2478
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.797
control. We're firing off

2479
00:55:24.898 --> 00:55:27.552
top-level primary agents from

2480
00:55:27.552 --> 00:55:29.110
our in-loop primary agent

2481
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.469
here. Okay, so there's
