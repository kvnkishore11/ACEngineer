00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:12.519
A focused engineer is

2
00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.497
a performant engineer and

3
00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:16.036
a focused agent is

4
00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.015
a performant agent. Context

5
00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:19.475
engineering is the name

6
00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:20.234
of the game for

7
00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.112
high value engineering in

8
00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.551
the age of agents.

9
00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:25.310
So how good are

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.469
your context engineering skills?

11
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.890
Do you have a

12
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.149
skill issue? Let's find

13
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.388
out and fix it.
WEBVTT

13
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.388
out and fix it.

14
00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:31.527
There are three levels

15
00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.246
of context engineering and

16
00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:34.686
a fourth hidden level

17
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.829
if you're on the

18
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.509
bleeding edge pushing into

19
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.387
agentic engineering. But first

20
00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:40.167
we have to ask,

21
00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:41.926
why are context engineering

22
00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.165
techniques so important? It's

23
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.704
because context engineering enables

24
00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:48.064
you to manage the

25
00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:50.563
precious and delicate resource

26
00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:51.921
that is the context

27
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.600
window of your agents

28
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.420
like Claude Code. There

29
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.740
are only two ways

30
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.698
to manage your context

31
00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.497
window, R and D.

32
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.149
Let's break down each
WEBVTT

32
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.149
Let's break down each

33
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.908
technique at each level

34
00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:04.087
and use the R&D

35
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.206
framework to maximize not

36
00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:07.025
what you can do,

37
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:08.203
but what your agents

38
00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:12.840
can do for you.

39
00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.778
A huge focus in

40
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:16.438
TAC is scaling up

41
00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:17.637
the intelligence we can

42
00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.115
deploy both in the

43
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.275
loop and out the

44
00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:21.674
loop. But with every

45
00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:22.873
agent we create, we

46
00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:24.930
must adopt their perspective

47
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.870
to maximize their impact

48
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.030
context is a critical

49
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.868
in-agent leverage point that

50
00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:32.489
determines how an agent

51
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:34.308
performs at any given

52
00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:35.489
task there's a sweet

53
00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:36.769
spot a range of

54
00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:38.328
context where your agent

55
00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:40.028
performs to its maximum

56
00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:41.968
possible capability for the

57
00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.207
task at hand as

58
00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:44.128
you scale up to

59
00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:45.427
hundreds and thousands of

60
00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:47.186
agent executions hitting this

61
00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.846
sweet spot consistently becomes

62
00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.326
even more important and

63
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.266
we do that with

64
00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:54.406
context engineering we obsessively

65
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.286
manage the context going

66
00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:57.816
in our agents. We

67
00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.394
adopt our agents perspective

68
00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.051
to gain an awareness
WEBVTT

68
00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.051
to gain an awareness

69
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.248
of the state of

70
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.787
our agents inside of

71
00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.603
our agentic pipelines, inside

72
00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:07.421
of our ADWs. When

73
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:08.319
aligned with the right

74
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.117
model prompt pools and

75
00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:11.396
the right range of

76
00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:12.657
context, we can hit

77
00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:14.436
the core four bullseye

78
00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.794
over and over and

79
00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:17.873
over. This directly increases

80
00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:19.734
our agentic coding KPIs

81
00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:20.832
we break down in

82
00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:21.772
tech and our KPIs

83
00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:24.111
directly tell us if

84
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.491
we're improving our agentic

85
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.310
coding capabilities. Adding the

86
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.889
right context to your

87
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.030
agent is usually the
WEBVTT

87
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.030
agent is usually the

88
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.129
easy part. The real

89
00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.829
trick is finding the

90
00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.788
context agentically and then

91
00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.248
removing and delegating context

92
00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:37.989
so that it doesn't

93
00:02:38.068 --> 00:02:39.568
end up creating context

94
00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.367
rot and context bloat.

95
00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.187
Search and destroy is

96
00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:44.587
the real skill in

97
00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:46.187
context engineering, and we

98
00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.206
can do this better

99
00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:48.687
than anyone with the

100
00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:50.507
R&D framework. When you

101
00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:51.646
boil it down, there

102
00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:52.605
are only two ways

103
00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.686
to manage your context

104
00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:55.485
window, R and D.

105
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.768
reduce and delegate. Every

106
00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:59.127
technique we'll break down

107
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.626
right now fits into
WEBVTT

107
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.626
right now fits into

108
00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:01.765
one or both of

109
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.283
these buckets. Let's start

110
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.283
at the beginner level

111
00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.163
and move up to

112
00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:06.722
more technical levels of

113
00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:11.457
context engineering. Your agent's

114
00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.578
context window is a

115
00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:15.235
precious, renewable, but limited

116
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.093
temporal resource. What does

117
00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.234
that mean? The context

118
00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:19.253
window is ephemeral. It

119
00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:21.353
resets. It's alive for

120
00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:22.073
only a certain amount

121
00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:22.991
of time and the

122
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.271
state in your context

123
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.691
window is critical to

124
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.850
your success. Whenever you

125
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.751
have a resource that

126
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.449
determines your success, you

127
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.909
must measure it so
WEBVTT

127
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.909
must measure it so

128
00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:31.969
you can improve it.

129
00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.669
The context window is

130
00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.088
the single most important

131
00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:36.967
leverage point for effective

132
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.487
agentic coding. So how

133
00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:39.187
do we measure it?

134
00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:40.507
Inside of the elite

135
00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.425
context engineering codebase,

136
00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:43.485
we can break down

137
00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.649
how exactly we'll measure

138
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.109
our context in our

139
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.608
Claude Code agents. We

140
00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:50.526
have two primary modes

141
00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.725
of measuring context, context

142
00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:53.846
in our agent and

143
00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:55.365
context we might add

144
00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:56.344
to our agent. If

145
00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:56.783
we spin up a

146
00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.044
Claude Code instance, you

147
00:03:58.044 --> 00:03:58.663
can see here we

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.082
have some context problems
WEBVTT

148
00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.082
have some context problems

149
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:01.322
already that we'll work

150
00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:02.042
through. You can type

151
00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:04.241
slash context and see

152
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.080
all the context in

153
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.800
our agent's context window.

154
00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.318
This is your most

155
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.518
important tool for measuring

156
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.968
and therefore managing your

157
00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.088
context window. It shows

158
00:04:14.088 --> 00:04:15.149
you exactly how much

159
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.608
stuff your agent will

160
00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:18.326
work through with every

161
00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:19.966
prompt execution. You can

162
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:20.826
see here we are

163
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.209
absolutely torching or clawed

164
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:24.348
opus tokens. We have

165
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.586
63K tokens already spent

166
00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:28.747
on boot up. If

167
00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:29.826

168
00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.225
context, you will not

169
00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:32.545
find this information and

170
00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:33.684
you will not know

171
00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:34.744
that we've already spent

172
00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.562
31% of our available

173
00:04:36.562 --> 00:04:38.281
context window. Our second

174
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.740
mechanism for understanding context

175
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.000
is token counters. In

176
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.079
the bottom right of

177
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.199
my instance here, you

178
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.178
can see I have

179
00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.697
a token counter counting

180
00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:47.858
the number of tokens

181
00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:49.536
highlighted and in the

182
00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:51.456
file. We have 2,600

183
00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:52.975
tokens available in the

184
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:54.553
README. So anytime our

185
00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:55.673
agent interacts with the

186
00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:56.732
README, which is a

187
00:04:56.732 --> 00:04:58.091

agents, they'll consume 2000

189
00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:01.440
tokens if they read

190
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.821
the entire file. Measuring

191
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:05.040
your context is foundational.

192
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.639
Every context engineering technique

193
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.877
we build from here

194
00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:09.218
depends on this. If

195
00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:10.456
you aren't actively paying

196
00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.716
attention to the state

197
00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:13.076
of your agent's context,

198
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.514
you're just vibe coding

199
00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.615
and you'll only be

200
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.473
able to tackle the

201
00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:18.033
lowest hanging fruit, which

202
00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:19.632
is already a massively

203
00:05:19.632 --> 00:05:21.192
saturated space. To push

204
00:05:21.192 --> 00:05:22.771
further, you must learn

205
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:23.831
to see from your

206
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.529
agent's perspective. What gets

207
00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.408
measured gets managed. So

208
00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:29.228
measure your context window.

209
00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.908
Use slash context and
WEBVTT

209
00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.908
Use slash context and

210
00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:33.127
install a tokenizer right

211
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:34.247
in your IDE so

212
00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:35.307
you know what's coming

213
00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:37.185
into your agent's context.

214
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.084
Do not load MCP

215
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.384
servers unless you need

216
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:45.403
them. Take a look

217
00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:46.124
at how much of

218
00:05:46.124 --> 00:05:48.084
my Claude Code Opus

219
00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:49.223
tokens are being chewed

220
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.963
up by MCP tools.

221
00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:54.141
24.1 thousand tokens. Okay,

222
00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:55.641
this is 12% of

223
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.901
the entire available context

224
00:05:57.901 --> 00:05:59.978
window, it's very likely
WEBVTT

225
00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:01.538
you're wasting tokens with

226
00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:02.937
MCP servers you're not

227
00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:04.416
actively using. This is

228
00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:05.976
a simple, easy beginner

229
00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:07.377
context engineering mistake to

230
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:09.276
make. Thankfully, the solution

231
00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.935
is simple. Be very

232
00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.576
purposeful with your MCP

233
00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:13.415
servers. If we open

234
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.915
up the directory here,

235
00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:15.415
you can see we

236
00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:17.134
have a variety of

237
00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:18.875
MCP servers. Inside of

238
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.855
the .mcp.json file, we

239
00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:21.915
have a bad practice

240
00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.353
of context engineering inside

241
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:23.994
of this codebase.

242
00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:25.394
We have a default

243
00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:27.425
.mcp.json file that is

244
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:29.504
always loading into the

245
00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:30.625
context window of our
WEBVTT

245
00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:30.625
context window of our

246
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.504
agents. Just for MCP

247
00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:34.884
servers, it's consuming 24K

248
00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:36.483
tokens. Let's round down,

249
00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:37.682
that's 10% of our

250
00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:40.101
entire 200K token context

251
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.322
window, chewing up expensive,

252
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.540
valuable Claude Opus tokens.

253
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.201
You might have a

254
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.339
model in the future,

255
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.720
regardless of your model,

256
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.439
context management is still

257
00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.658
critically important. 10K tokens

258
00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:54.177
is 5% of your

259
00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:55.641
entire 200K context window.

260
00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.262
This means 5% less

261
00:06:57.262 --> 00:06:58.321
work you can do

262
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.000
with this swing of
WEBVTT

262
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.000
with this swing of

263
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
your agent. And if

264
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.841
you boot up five

265
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.300
agents over an hour,

266
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:04.860
that's 25% of a

267
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.439
context window in total,

268
00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.480
completely wasted, okay? Unless

269
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.800
you're always using every

270
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.939
single MCP server, which

271
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.178
I highly doubt, okay?

272
00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:13.918
As you can see,

273
00:07:13.918 --> 00:07:14.838
these numbers will stack

274
00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:15.759
up against you very

275
00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.978
quickly. The first thing

276
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.338
I recommend doing is

277
00:07:18.478 --> 00:07:19.978
get rid of this.mcp.json.

278
00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:22.458
Just completely delete this

279
00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.069
thing. Okay, don't use

280
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.346
a default.mcp.json for your

281
00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.565
codebase. All right,

282
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:28.384
and why is that?

283
00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:29.485
It's because right away

284
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.923
clears up our context
WEBVTT

284
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.923
clears up our context

285
00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:31.523
window, okay? If we

286
00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:33.261
type Claude now context,

287
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.201
we've just saved some

288
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.459
20,000 tokens by not

289
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.737
preloading any MCP servers,

290
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.916
okay? Do not assume

291
00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:40.576
you need these. If

292
00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:41.615
you do need these,

293
00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:42.495
I recommend you fire

294
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.014
these up by hand.

295
00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:45.053
The cracked Claude Code

296
00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.494
team at Anthropic has

297
00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:47.692
a couple of quick,

298
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.451
simple, easy command line

299
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.351
flags you can use.

300
00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.591
Cloud dash dash MCP

301
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.550
config, and now you

302
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.689
just pass in the

303
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:54.410
config you want. So

304
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.110
let's say I just

305
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.509
wanted the Firecrawl MCP

306
00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.108
server. You can see

307
00:07:57.108 --> 00:07:58.348
I have this specialized

308
00:07:58.348 --> 00:07:59.747
file here that pulls

309
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:01.206
in just the Firecrawl
WEBVTT

309
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:01.206
in just the Firecrawl

310
00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:02.565
MCP server, and I've

311
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:03.685
self fixed it with

312
00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:04.685
4K. So I know

313
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.225
exactly how many tokens

314
00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.264
are going to get

315
00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:08.403
consumed by default every

316
00:08:08.403 --> 00:08:09.141
time. Okay, so I

317
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:10.081
can copy the path

318
00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:11.160
to this, paste that

319
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.038
there. And if you

320
00:08:12.038 --> 00:08:13.218
do have some globals

321
00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:14.235
that you wanna overwrite,

322
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:15.314
you can use dash

323
00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:17.333
dash strict MCP config,

324
00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.132
and then you can

325
00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:19.151
fire this off and

326
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:20.170
check this out. When

327
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.689
we run slash context,

328
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.689
we're only going to

329
00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:24.149
get that 6K tokens

330
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:25.887
strictly from the Firecrawl

331
00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.326
MCP server. And now

332
00:08:27.326 --> 00:08:28.045
we can kick off

333
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.084
this specialized agent focused
WEBVTT

333
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.084
this specialized agent focused

334
00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:31.043
on just this one

335
00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:32.202
MCP server, all right?

336
00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:33.201
And if you do

337
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:34.760
need every single MCP

338
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.500
server, explicitly reference it,

339
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.457
be very conscious with

340
00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:39.976
the state going into

341
00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:41.436
your context window. There

342
00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:42.495
are many places to

343
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:44.094
be wasteful as an

344
00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:45.677
engineer, to move fast

345
00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:46.817
and break things. The

346
00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:48.157
context window of your

347
00:08:48.157 --> 00:08:49.916
agents is not one

348
00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:51.255
of them. Here, we

349
00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:51.995
are of course using

350
00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.315
the R in the

351
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:54.615
R and D framework.

352
00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.294
We are reducing. So

353
00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:57.153
you might think this

354
00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:57.653
is not a big

355
00:08:57.653 --> 00:08:58.474
deal, but you have

356
00:08:58.474 --> 00:08:59.693
to think about every

357
00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.332
single agent instance you
WEBVTT

357
00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.332
single agent instance you

358
00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.312
boot up. Okay, we're

359
00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:03.253
talking about tens and

360
00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:04.371
hundreds. And as you

361
00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:05.631
scale up, this bad

362
00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:07.571
practice will bleed into

363
00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:09.051
your leverage points of

364
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:10.509
agentic coding. Okay, they

365
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:11.860
scale all the way

366
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.990
in, your ADWs. Only

367
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.070
use these MCP servers

368
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.688
when you explicitly need

369
00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:18.568
them because they come

370
00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:22.149
with a cost. This

371
00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:22.989
technique is a bit

372
00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:25.227
controversial, especially for beginners,

373
00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:26.768
but I strongly recommend

374
00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:28.847
context priming over using

375
00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.648
a claw.md or any
WEBVTT

375
00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.648
a claw.md or any

376
00:09:30.648 --> 00:09:32.346
similar auto loading memory

377
00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:33.626
file. While this seems

378
00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:34.907
convenient at first, it

379
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.427
creates problems as you

380
00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:38.105
scale your agentic coding

381
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.645
across different tasks. So

382
00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:42.046
what is context priming?

383
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:42.860
and why is it

384
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.480
superior to a memory

385
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.678
file? And why is

386
00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:47.397
it superior to claw.md?

387
00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:48.676
Let's first double click

388
00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:50.514
into claw.md. There's nothing

389
00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:52.253
inherently wrong with this

390
00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:53.870
file. Like most technology,

391
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.269
it's how it's used

392
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.428
that's the problem. If

393
00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:57.268
we boot up a

394
00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:58.527
new instance here, you

395
00:09:58.527 --> 00:09:59.806
can see right away
WEBVTT

396
00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:01.256
we have this error

397
00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:02.496
message. Let's address this

398
00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:03.696
now, okay? We have

399
00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:05.274
built up a massive,

400
00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:06.235
and I mean massive,

401
00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.894
claw.md file. If we

402
00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:09.073
run slash context once

403
00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:11.113
again and monitor what's

404
00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:12.052
going on here, we

405
00:10:12.052 --> 00:10:12.772
have cleaned up our

406
00:10:12.772 --> 00:10:14.010
MCP servers, but we

407
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.331
haven't cleaned up is

408
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.009
this massive memory file.

409
00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:18.749
We have a 23,000

410
00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:20.467
token memory file, again,

411
00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:21.508
showing up about 10%

412
00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:23.647
of our entire context

413
00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:25.745
window of expensive Opus

414
00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:27.264
tokens. I'm of course

415
00:10:27.264 --> 00:10:29.663
exaggerating my claw.md file

416
00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.024
here just to showcase
WEBVTT

416
00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.024
here just to showcase

417
00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:32.163
this idea, but I

418
00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:33.283
can almost guarantee you

419
00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:34.962
there's an engineer out

420
00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:35.861
there somewhere with a

421
00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:37.642
claw.md file that is,

422
00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.140
you know, 3,000 lines

423
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.081
long. And why is

424
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.221
that? It's because they

425
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:42.441
and their team, they've

426
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:45.100
just constantly added additional

427
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.080
items to their memory

428
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.219
over and over and

429
00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:48.458
over again until it's

430
00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.019
become what it is

431
00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:51.918
now. Okay, a massive

432
00:10:51.957 --> 00:10:53.697
glob of mess, okay?

433
00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:54.836
Even the claw code

434
00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:55.897
engineers built in a

435
00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:57.297
warning here for us.

436
00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:59.716
Large claw.md will impact

437
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:01.215
performance What they're really
WEBVTT

437
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:01.215
performance What they're really

438
00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:02.514
saying here is There's

439
00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:03.653
a big chunk of

440
00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:04.673
state in the context

441
00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:05.812
window that will likely

442
00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:07.691
change the outcome and

443
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:08.671
deter it from the

444
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:09.830
outcome you're looking for.

445
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.549
The claw.md file is

446
00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:12.928
incredible for one reason.

447
00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:14.327
It's a reusable memory

448
00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:16.206
file that's always loaded

449
00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.647
into your agent's context

450
00:11:17.647 --> 00:11:20.285
window. Simultaneously, a claw.md

451
00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.985
file is terrible for

452
00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:23.364
the exact same reason.

453
00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:24.644
It's a reusable memory

454
00:11:24.644 --> 00:11:26.763
file that's always loaded

455
00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:27.902
into your agent's context

456
00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:28.881
window. So why is

457
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:29.701
that a problem? The

458
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.159
problem with always on
WEBVTT

458
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.159
problem with always on

459
00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:32.320
context is that It's

460
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.018
not dynamic or controllable.

461
00:11:34.077 --> 00:11:35.395
Engineering work inside of

462
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.693
codebases constantly changes,

463
00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:39.152
but the claw.md file

464
00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:40.929
only grows. Over time,

465
00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:41.610
as you and your

466
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.707
team add more information,

467
00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:43.528
the file grows and

468
00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.485
grows, and eventually it

469
00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.823
becomes bloated with context

470
00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:48.542
that isn't relevant to

471
00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.192
every engineering task, and

472
00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:50.611
this is the key.

473
00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:52.509
Eventually, it's not gonna

474
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:53.190
be relevant for the

475
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.009
work you're doing. It's

476
00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:55.028
going to have useless

477
00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:56.645
context in your precious

478
00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.065
context window, and in

479
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:58.943
the worst case, it's

480
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:01.902
gonna have contradictory information
WEBVTT

480
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:01.902
gonna have contradictory information

481
00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:02.961
inside of your context

482
00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:03.639
window. That is the

483
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.938
worst possible case, and

484
00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:06.236
this will happen if

485
00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:07.336
you just keep growing

486
00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:08.275
your memory file. All

487
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.254
right, so what's the

488
00:12:09.254 --> 00:12:10.750
solution here? The solution

489
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.649
is context priming. Let's

490
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.969
trim down, right? Let's

491
00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:15.788
use this flaw.concise, right?

492
00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:16.849
It's a lot simpler.

493
00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:17.708
It's something that we

494
00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:18.969
always want to add,

495
00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:19.668
you know, and take

496
00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:20.089
a look at this,

497
00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:21.408
right? It's only 43

498
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.548
lines and it's just

499
00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:23.187
got some, you know,

500
00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:24.988
mock structure for this

501
00:12:24.988 --> 00:12:26.107
codebase. And these

502
00:12:26.107 --> 00:12:27.207
are just some things

503
00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:28.628
that we always want

504
00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.027
every single agent to
WEBVTT

504
00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.027
every single agent to

505
00:12:30.027 --> 00:12:31.346
have, okay? I have

506
00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:32.407
to keep stressing that

507
00:12:32.407 --> 00:12:33.147
because this is the

508
00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:34.547
reality of the memory

509
00:12:34.547 --> 00:12:36.005
file. It will always

510
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.225
be added. So copy

511
00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:38.686
this, we'll clean this

512
00:12:38.706 --> 00:12:40.782
up, save that, resetter

513
00:12:40.782 --> 00:12:42.561
agent here, CLD is

514
00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:43.679
an alias. You can

515
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.379
check out all the

516
00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.479
aliases I'm gonna run

517
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:46.798
throughout this lesson. At

518
00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:47.457
the bottom of the

519
00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:48.456
readme, you can see

520
00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:49.437
all the aliases right

521
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:50.475
here. All right, so

522
00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:51.674
now we have a

523
00:12:51.674 --> 00:12:53.375
concise MD file. The

524
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:54.354
warning is gone. We

525
00:12:54.354 --> 00:12:56.393
can type slash context

526
00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:57.912
and check this out.

527
00:12:58.072 --> 00:12:59.530
Our context window on

528
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.590
boot up on startup
WEBVTT

528
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.590
boot up on startup

529
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.533
is looking Much, much

530
00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:04.932
better, 92% free. What's

531
00:13:04.932 --> 00:13:06.251
left, right? Our small

532
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.230
memory file is down

533
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.269
to 0.2%, right? 350

534
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:10.690
tokens, this is great.

535
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.589
This is a clear

536
00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:13.249
focus agent. Now, what

537
00:13:13.249 --> 00:13:14.548
do we use instead

538
00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:16.386
of this large memory

539
00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:18.306
file? We should context

540
00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:19.105
prime. What does that

541
00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:19.605
mean? Let me show

542
00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:21.445
you, slash prime, and

543
00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:22.563
we hit enter. Context

544
00:13:22.563 --> 00:13:23.423
priming is when you

545
00:13:23.423 --> 00:13:25.123
use a dedicated reusable

546
00:13:25.123 --> 00:13:27.221
prompt, AKA a custom

547
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:28.701
slash command, to set

548
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:29.961
up your agent's initial

549
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:32.279
context window specifically for
WEBVTT

549
00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:32.279
context window specifically for

550
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.399
the task type at

551
00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.500
hand. So with every

552
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.099
codebase, I always

553
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:38.217
set up Claude commands

554
00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:39.498
You can see here

555
00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:40.337
we have two prime

556
00:13:40.337 --> 00:13:41.398
commands in this code

557
00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:42.937
base. Priming is just

558
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:44.057
a reusable prompt. We

559
00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:44.537
can take a look

560
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:45.277
at this right here.

561
00:13:45.277 --> 00:13:46.596
It's very simple. It

562
00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:48.196
has a concise structure

563
00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:48.956
where we have the

564
00:13:48.956 --> 00:13:50.395
purpose, we have our

565
00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:51.196
run step, we have

566
00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:52.176
a read step and

567
00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:53.495
a report step. Okay,

568
00:13:53.676 --> 00:13:54.754
now our agent is

569
00:13:54.754 --> 00:13:55.934
ready to go. So

570
00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:56.534
it's read a couple

571
00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:57.615
files, it's read the

572
00:13:57.615 --> 00:13:59.034
readme, it understands the

573
00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:00.193
structure of the code
WEBVTT

573
00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:00.193
structure of the code

574
00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:00.874
base. And now if

575
00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.614
we type context, our

576
00:14:02.614 --> 00:14:03.793
agent, has a little

577
00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:05.232
bit of information about

578
00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.592
this codebase for

579
00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:08.692
this specific problem set.

580
00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:09.491
And so this problem

581
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:10.371
set is of course,

582
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:11.851
just getting a general

583
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.870
understanding of our code

584
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.990
base. So instead of

585
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.331
relying on a static

586
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:17.629
always loaded memory file,

587
00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:19.250
we're using context priming

588
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.969
to gain full control

589
00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.769
over the initial context

590
00:14:22.969 --> 00:14:23.888
of our agents. This

591
00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:25.368
is very powerful. Unlike

592
00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:26.488
the memory file, we

593
00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:28.067
can prime against several

594
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.047
different areas of focus
WEBVTT

594
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.047
different areas of focus

595
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.306
in our codebase.

596
00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:32.765
Okay, so imagine a

597
00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:34.565
you know, prime bug

598
00:14:34.764 --> 00:14:36.144
command, right? For bug

599
00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:37.764
smashing, imagine a prime

600
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.783
chore or prime feature,

601
00:14:39.863 --> 00:14:40.341
or like we have

602
00:14:40.383 --> 00:14:41.221
in this codebase,

603
00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:43.260
prime CC, okay? This

604
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.000
is a focused prompt.

605
00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:45.940
It's our hot loading

606
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.958
memory file for operating

607
00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.038
with Claude code and

608
00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:51.317
updating the Claude code

609
00:14:51.317 --> 00:14:52.336
files inside of this

610
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.836
codebase, okay? And

611
00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:54.275
so, you know, you

612
00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:55.196
can see it looks

613
00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:56.715
very similar. We're actually

614
00:14:56.715 --> 00:14:58.214
running the base prime

615
00:14:58.214 --> 00:14:59.832
command right from the

616
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.011
prime CC command to
WEBVTT

616
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.011
prime CC command to

617
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:02.509
where we're stacking prompts

618
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:03.408
to better manage our

619
00:15:03.408 --> 00:15:04.687
context window. And then

620
00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:05.187
you can see here,

621
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:06.126
we're just saying read

622
00:15:06.126 --> 00:15:07.306
a couple extra files

623
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.044
and do the same

624
00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:09.283
thing, report your understanding

625
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.062
of the codebase.

626
00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:11.561
Even with this small

627
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.480
example, elite context engineering

628
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.057
codebase, there's already

629
00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:16.655
room for specialization. Are

630
00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:17.115
we working on the

631
00:15:17.135 --> 00:15:18.095
app level or are

632
00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:19.134
we working on the

633
00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:21.438
Claude agent level, right?

634
00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:22.337
And as you know

635
00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:23.476
from tech, we are

636
00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:24.894
talking here whenever we're

637
00:15:24.894 --> 00:15:26.273
working on the agents,

638
00:15:26.312 --> 00:15:27.811
we're talking about the

639
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.369
agentic layer, right? We're

640
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:30.726
working on the agentic
WEBVTT

640
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:30.726
working on the agentic

641
00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:31.785
layer. We're building the

642
00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:33.583
system that builds the

643
00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.101
system. So prime, right?

644
00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:37.057
Don't default. Your claw.md

645
00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:38.216
file should be shrunk

646
00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:39.774
to contain only the

647
00:15:39.774 --> 00:15:42.753
absolute universal essentials that

648
00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:44.731
you're 100% sure you

649
00:15:44.731 --> 00:15:46.211
want loaded 100% of

650
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:46.951
the time. You see

651
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:48.668
how powerful that conditional

652
00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:49.729
is and how strict

653
00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:50.768
that conditional is? So

654
00:15:50.768 --> 00:15:51.807
be very careful with

655
00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:53.006
these memory files, keep

656
00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:54.745
them slim, and instead

657
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:56.823
prefer context priming. This

658
00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:57.884
way you can build

659
00:15:57.884 --> 00:15:59.403
up many areas of

660
00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.644
focus for your agents.
WEBVTT

660
00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.644
focus for your agents.

661
00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:01.965
And if you find

662
00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:03.283
yourself coming back to

663
00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:04.643
some specific area of

664
00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:06.282
focus, build out a

665
00:16:06.282 --> 00:16:07.581
prime command for that

666
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.840
specific area of focus

667
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.899
for you and your

668
00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:10.778
team. This is the

669
00:16:10.778 --> 00:16:12.118
beginning of a big

670
00:16:12.118 --> 00:16:14.157
agentic level technique that

671
00:16:14.157 --> 00:16:15.015
we're gonna talk about

672
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.254
in this lesson. You

673
00:16:16.254 --> 00:16:16.794
can see we have

674
00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:19.452
this new experts directory.

675
00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:19.932
We'll talk about that

676
00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:20.472
at the end of

677
00:16:20.472 --> 00:16:21.792
this lesson. So now

678
00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.390
we enter the intermediate

679
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.048
zone. Let's enter the

680
00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:29.006
intermediate zone of context

681
00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:30.206
engineering and talk about
WEBVTT

681
00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:30.206
engineering and talk about

682
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.688
controlling your output tokens.

683
00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:33.947
Output tokens are nearly

684
00:16:33.947 --> 00:16:36.447
always the most expensive

685
00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:37.826
part of your agent.

686
00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:39.065
Output tokens are priced

687
00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:40.864
anywhere from three to

688
00:16:40.864 --> 00:16:42.403
five X the price

689
00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:43.543
of your input tokens.

690
00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:44.902
That means one right

691
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:46.201
costs you up to

692
00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:47.900
five times more output

693
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:49.480
tokens burn your compute

694
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.619
and therefore burn a

695
00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:51.578
hole in your wallet

696
00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.437
fast. Thankfully, We can

697
00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:55.177
micromanage this just a

698
00:16:55.177 --> 00:16:56.716
little bit with output

699
00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:58.176
styles to limit and

700
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.034
specify the types of
WEBVTT

700
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.034
specify the types of

701
00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:01.034
output you want Cloud

702
00:17:01.034 --> 00:17:02.474
Code to have and

703
00:17:02.474 --> 00:17:04.013
therefore the number of

704
00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:05.772
output tokens CloudCode will

705
00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:07.912
generate when responding. Now

706
00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:08.671
it's important to note

707
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.611
a lot of the

708
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.630
output tokens are chewed

709
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.529
up when you're actually

710
00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.088
writing and generating files

711
00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:14.088
and when CloudCode is

712
00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:16.147
returning large chunks back

713
00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:17.106
to you, there's not

714
00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:17.787
a lot you can

715
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:18.645
do about this, but

716
00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:20.066
we can control the

717
00:17:20.066 --> 00:17:22.384
responses CloudCode has directly

718
00:17:22.404 --> 00:17:22.903
to you. Now we

719
00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:24.243
can showcase that with

720
00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:25.782
a CloudCode settings file.

721
00:17:25.782 --> 00:17:27.422
So inside of our

722
00:17:27.554 --> 00:17:28.893
dot Claude directory here,

723
00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:30.011
we have settings dot
WEBVTT

723
00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:30.011
we have settings dot

724
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:31.631
local dot concise. All

725
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:32.050
right, so I'm gonna

726
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.750
copy the path to

727
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.589
this and you can

728
00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:34.788
see it has an

729
00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.567
output style specified, okay?

730
00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.007
It has a one

731
00:17:38.007 --> 00:17:39.746
word output style, right?

732
00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:40.265
So let's see how

733
00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:41.105
powerful this can be.

734
00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:42.604
Claude in Yolo mode

735
00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:44.561
with Sonnet, specify a

736
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.080
settings file right here

737
00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:46.941
and kick this off.

738
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.759
Now we'll just type

739
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.500
something simple here, we'll

740
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.499
just say hi and

741
00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:50.239
then we'll open up

742
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:51.417
another terminal side by

743
00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:52.757
side and type Claude.

744
00:17:52.757 --> 00:17:53.556
So you can see

745
00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:56.913
here our agent just

746
00:17:56.913 --> 00:17:58.554
said done. Okay, so

747
00:17:58.554 --> 00:17:59.753
it's not interested in

748
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:00.553
talking to us. It's
WEBVTT

748
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:00.553
talking to us. It's

749
00:18:00.553 --> 00:18:02.053
not interested in chewing

750
00:18:02.093 --> 00:18:03.472
up output tokens. Now

751
00:18:03.593 --> 00:18:04.212
here on the right

752
00:18:04.212 --> 00:18:04.811
side, if we type

753
00:18:04.872 --> 00:18:06.311
output styles, you can

754
00:18:06.311 --> 00:18:07.092
see we're running the

755
00:18:07.092 --> 00:18:08.092
default. And let me

756
00:18:08.092 --> 00:18:08.751
actually go ahead and

757
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:09.510
get this in YOLO

758
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.411
mode here as well,

759
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.550
running the Sonnet model.

760
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.830
Output styles here, we

761
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.650
have default. And if

762
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.390
we say hi here,

763
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.009
we're of course gonna

764
00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:17.000
get a normal response

765
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.641
coming out of cloud

766
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.778
code, okay? So right

767
00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:20.837
away with just a

768
00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:22.696
high, we are getting

769
00:18:22.696 --> 00:18:23.875
a massive difference in

770
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.414
output tokens, okay? And

771
00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:26.493
keep in mind, these

772
00:18:26.493 --> 00:18:28.212
are output tokens, right?

773
00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.172
Let's kick this up,

774
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:29.750
right? Let me show

775
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.990
you the scale in
WEBVTT

775
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.990
you the scale in

776
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.689
which this is important.

777
00:18:32.709 --> 00:18:33.488
Let's run a classic

778
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:34.967
prompt. What does this

779
00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:35.967
codebase do? And

780
00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:36.766
I'm gonna copy that.

781
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:37.526
kick it off here,

782
00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:38.326
kick it off here.

783
00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:38.884
So these are both

784
00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.045
the sonnet models. They're

785
00:18:40.045 --> 00:18:41.085
both going down their

786
00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:42.804
non-deterministic path. Here is

787
00:18:42.804 --> 00:18:44.084
our verbose on the

788
00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:45.104
right, and here is

789
00:18:45.104 --> 00:18:46.403
our one word on

790
00:18:46.403 --> 00:18:47.643
the left. So again,

791
00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:49.002
just take note of

792
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.102
the difference here, right?

793
00:18:50.102 --> 00:18:50.801
And let's go ahead

794
00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:52.442
and run slash context

795
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:53.461
on the left, slash

796
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:54.461
context on the right.

797
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.700
And let's just briefly

798
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.759
look at the output

799
00:18:57.779 --> 00:18:58.740
tokens here. So we

800
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.038
can see there's no
WEBVTT

800
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.038
can see there's no

801
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.239
difference in token usage

802
00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:02.578
yet. In fact, our

803
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:03.817
concise agent has actually

804
00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:04.397
spent a few more

805
00:19:04.397 --> 00:19:05.917
tokens reading in and

806
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:06.856
looking for files. Okay,

807
00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:08.096
let's keep pushing this

808
00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:08.715
and get out of

809
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.016
the non-deterministic nature, right?

810
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:11.414
Let's find the average

811
00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:11.875
here. Okay, I'm gonna

812
00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:12.874
fire this off here

813
00:19:13.134 --> 00:19:14.013
and I'm gonna fire

814
00:19:14.013 --> 00:19:15.413
this off here, okay?

815
00:19:15.413 --> 00:19:16.093
And so what we're

816
00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:16.573
doing here is we're

817
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.071
reading some documentation in

818
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:19.090
AI docs. We can

819
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.730
pull this up right

820
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.090
here. It's Claude Code,

821
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.868
TypeScript SDK documentation, and

822
00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:24.608
we're letting our agents

823
00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:25.647
just kick off and

824
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:26.647
run side by side,

825
00:19:26.827 --> 00:19:27.407
all right? And the

826
00:19:27.407 --> 00:19:28.686
important thing to pay

827
00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:29.905
attention to here is

828
00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.144
the response of our
WEBVTT

828
00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.144
the response of our

829
00:19:32.144 --> 00:19:33.484
one word output style

830
00:19:33.684 --> 00:19:35.183
versus our default cloud

831
00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:36.243
code style they're both

832
00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:36.644
going to do the

833
00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:37.544
same work they're both

834
00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:38.784
going to complete and

835
00:19:38.784 --> 00:19:40.064
generate this new file

836
00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:41.284
right here but the

837
00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:42.583
difference and the output

838
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:43.383
and the difference and

839
00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.103
the consumption of tokens

840
00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:46.903
specifically the output tokens

841
00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:47.823
is going to be

842
00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:49.163
larger and we can

843
00:19:49.163 --> 00:19:50.242
look at this output

844
00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:52.143
style exactly concise done

845
00:19:52.242 --> 00:19:52.843
check this out so

846
00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:53.323
we have a you

847
00:19:53.323 --> 00:19:54.603
know list here of

848
00:19:54.643 --> 00:19:56.362
output styles and you

849
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.321
can see here we

850
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.662
are continuously reiterating this

851
00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:00.761
clock code output style
WEBVTT

851
00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:00.761
clock code output style

852
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:02.301
to just say done

853
00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:03.648
There are of course

854
00:20:03.648 --> 00:20:04.807
a couple exceptions to

855
00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:06.127
this. We don't always

856
00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:07.166
just want a point

857
00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:09.085
blank done response. If

858
00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:09.805
we ask our agent

859
00:20:09.805 --> 00:20:11.104
a question or something

860
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:12.303
goes wrong, we of

861
00:20:12.303 --> 00:20:12.863
course want a more

862
00:20:12.883 --> 00:20:14.622
written out response. But

863
00:20:14.642 --> 00:20:15.240
most of the time

864
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.901
when our agent is

865
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:17.339
shipping work successfully, all

866
00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:17.898
it needs to do

867
00:20:17.898 --> 00:20:19.398
is respond with done,

868
00:20:19.478 --> 00:20:20.258
which is what we're

869
00:20:20.258 --> 00:20:20.916
gonna see here in

870
00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:21.856
just a second. So

871
00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:22.516
you can see on

872
00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:23.755
the right side, our

873
00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:25.015
agent has completed and

874
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.673
it's reported these output

875
00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:27.792
tokens to us here.

876
00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:28.352
And on the left

877
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.551
side here, when our

878
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.830
agent finishes, it's going
WEBVTT

878
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.830
agent finishes, it's going

879
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.549
to just report Done.

880
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:33.729
It's not giving us

881
00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:35.846
any extraneous, extra detail,

882
00:20:35.846 --> 00:20:37.306
verbose information. We know

883
00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:38.424
exactly what we asked.

884
00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:39.483
Just tell us if

885
00:20:39.483 --> 00:20:40.442
it was successful or

886
00:20:40.442 --> 00:20:41.422
if it failed. Okay?

887
00:20:41.422 --> 00:20:42.561
And so, you know,

888
00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:43.101
this might seem like

889
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:43.800
a small thing. What

890
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.299
I want to do

891
00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:45.219
is just showcase this

892
00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:46.538
simple idea so that

893
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.916
you can understand at

894
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:49.915
scale how important this

895
00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:50.474
is. Okay? So we'll

896
00:20:50.474 --> 00:20:51.314
paste this in. And

897
00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:52.397
of course, we can

898
00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:54.115
monitor our token usage.

899
00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:54.675
We can see point

900
00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:56.433
blank, this one response

901
00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:57.032
coming out of cloud

902
00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:59.211
code consumed 150 output

903
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.650
tokens, okay? Not too
WEBVTT

903
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.650
tokens, okay? Not too

904
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.989
bad, right? Now, if

905
00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:02.327
we open up a

906
00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:03.547
new file and copy

907
00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:04.986
done, all right, let's

908
00:21:04.986 --> 00:21:06.125
copy just done. And

909
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:07.124
we'll actually put this

910
00:21:07.124 --> 00:21:07.982
on the left and

911
00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:09.061
we'll put this on

912
00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:09.861
the right. You can

913
00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:10.760
see here we have

914
00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:13.438
two tokens, all right?

915
00:21:14.082 --> 00:21:14.961
So it's not the

916
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:15.901
fact that this is

917
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:16.661
a ton of tokens,

918
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.500
it's not, but it's

919
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.539
the fact that this

920
00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:19.898
is two tokens and

921
00:21:19.898 --> 00:21:22.157
this is 150 tokens.

922
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.538
When we're running Outlook

923
00:21:23.557 --> 00:21:24.356
agents, as we start

924
00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:24.936
to get out the

925
00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:25.816
loop, we don't need

926
00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.655
to be chewing up

927
00:21:26.695 --> 00:21:29.234
this 150 extra tokens

928
00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:31.034
across tens of prompts,
WEBVTT

928
00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:31.034
across tens of prompts,

929
00:21:31.114 --> 00:21:32.613
across hundreds of prompts

930
00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:34.032
and hundreds of agents,

931
00:21:34.073 --> 00:21:35.471
okay? Every piece of

932
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:37.090
context matters. When you

933
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:37.790
look at a graph

934
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.550
of this stuff, when

935
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.269
you start to see

936
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:40.949
your token consumption, you

937
00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:41.548
know this to be

938
00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:42.948
true, okay? We have

939
00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:44.188
reduced our token token

940
00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:45.366
usage here in this

941
00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:46.747
one element of Cloud

942
00:21:46.747 --> 00:21:49.385
Code down from 150.

943
00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.644
This is some massive

944
00:21:50.664 --> 00:21:53.223
99% reduction in token

945
00:21:53.223 --> 00:21:54.663
usage, okay? And it's

946
00:21:54.663 --> 00:21:55.663
all because we are

947
00:21:55.663 --> 00:21:57.781
controlling the output style

948
00:21:57.882 --> 00:21:58.922
of Claude Code with

949
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:01.240
a concise done prompt.
WEBVTT

949
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:01.240
a concise done prompt.

950
00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:02.220
There are other versions

951
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.140
of this. You can

952
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.239
find some better middle

953
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.098
ground, but you can

954
00:22:05.098 --> 00:22:06.538
see very quickly how

955
00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:07.417
this is gonna stack

956
00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:08.077
up and this is

957
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:08.616
a great way to

958
00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:11.315
conserve your token usage.

959
00:22:11.355 --> 00:22:12.453
Now, it's also important

960
00:22:12.473 --> 00:22:13.012
to note here that

961
00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:14.291
output styles do something

962
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.970
interesting to the Cloud

963
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.048
Code instance you're running.

964
00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:19.186
It effectively swaps the

965
00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:20.958
output style block in

966
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.176
the system prompt, right?

967
00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:23.615
It hot swaps the

968
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:24.796
output style block in

969
00:22:24.796 --> 00:22:25.775
the system prompt of

970
00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:26.515
Claude Code. This is

971
00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:27.854
an interesting trend. Keep

972
00:22:27.854 --> 00:22:28.334
your eye on this.

973
00:22:28.334 --> 00:22:28.973
We're gonna talk about

974
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.593
the future of context
WEBVTT

974
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.593
the future of context

975
00:22:30.593 --> 00:22:31.592
engineering at the end

976
00:22:31.592 --> 00:22:32.311
of this lesson, some

977
00:22:32.332 --> 00:22:34.090
potential future directions that

978
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.829
you can bet on.

979
00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:35.390
Let's go ahead and

980
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.689
close our agents and

981
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:37.348
move on to a

982
00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:39.067
big idea, a popular

983
00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.606
idea in the world

984
00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:41.965
of Claude Code. Let's

985
00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:46.864
talk about sub-agents. Now,

986
00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:47.623
it's not just about

987
00:22:47.623 --> 00:22:48.942
using sub-agents. This is

988
00:22:48.942 --> 00:22:51.074
about using sub-agents properly.

989
00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:52.673
When you use Cloud

990
00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:53.732
Code sub agents, you

991
00:22:53.732 --> 00:22:55.271
are effectively creating a

992
00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:57.550
partially forked context window.

993
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.431
Let's create a cloud

994
00:22:58.431 --> 00:22:59.371
instance here. If we

995
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.349
type context in an
WEBVTT

995
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.349
type context in an

996
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:02.569
agent, a brand new

997
00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:03.489
agent, you'll notice something

998
00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:04.828
really interesting. We have

999
00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:06.167
custom agents here. All

1000
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:06.728
right, we have three

1001
00:23:06.728 --> 00:23:07.548
custom agents that we

1002
00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:08.386
can use at any

1003
00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:09.287
point in time. We

1004
00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:10.487
can, of course, find

1005
00:23:10.487 --> 00:23:11.625
these inside of Cloud

1006
00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:12.690
Code. Under the agents

1007
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.969
directory, we can look

1008
00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:14.468
at any one of

1009
00:23:14.468 --> 00:23:15.268
these, right? Now you'll

1010
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.686
notice something quite interesting.

1011
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:17.426
All of our agents

1012
00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:18.726
here, our custom agents

1013
00:23:18.726 --> 00:23:21.144
only consume 122 tokens.

1014
00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:22.063
Whereas you can see

1015
00:23:22.063 --> 00:23:24.061
my rough token counter

1016
00:23:24.122 --> 00:23:25.401
is looking at 900

1017
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:26.201
for this one agent.

1018
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:27.400
What's going on here?

1019
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.798
What's the big difference?

1020
00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:29.478
The big difference here

1021
00:23:29.478 --> 00:23:30.278
is that when you're
WEBVTT

1021
00:23:29.478 --> 00:23:30.278
is that when you're

1022
00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:32.057
working with sub agents,

1023
00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:33.036
you are working with

1024
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:35.214
system prompts, okay? There

1025
00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:36.453
is a massive difference

1026
00:23:36.453 --> 00:23:37.932
between the system prompt

1027
00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:39.692
and a user prompt,

1028
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:40.611
right? When you're prompting

1029
00:23:40.611 --> 00:23:42.109
Claude Code, you're writing

1030
00:23:42.261 --> 00:23:43.442
user prompts when you're

1031
00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:45.280
building reusable custom slash

1032
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.760
commands, you're writing a

1033
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.039
user prompt that all

1034
00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:48.980
gets passed right into

1035
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.160
the agent. This is

1036
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.098
a system prompt, which

1037
00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:51.939
is nice because it

1038
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:52.919
means that it's not

1039
00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:54.218
directly added to our

1040
00:23:54.218 --> 00:23:56.137
primary agents context window.

1041
00:23:56.157 --> 00:23:57.856
Okay. And this advantage

1042
00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.797
of sub agents continues

1043
00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.736
with clock of sub
WEBVTT

1043
00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.736
with clock of sub

1044
00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:01.776
agents. We can delegate

1045
00:24:01.776 --> 00:24:03.096
work off of our

1046
00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:05.275
primary agents context window.

1047
00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:06.515
This is a massive

1048
00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:08.094
point for the D

1049
00:24:08.094 --> 00:24:08.913
and the R and

1050
00:24:08.913 --> 00:24:10.563
D framework, right? It's

1051
00:24:10.563 --> 00:24:12.298
delegation. We are keeping

1052
00:24:12.298 --> 00:24:13.753
context out of our

1053
00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:15.250
primary agents context window.

1054
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.207
For example, we can

1055
00:24:16.207 --> 00:24:18.384
run slash load AI

1056
00:24:18.384 --> 00:24:19.605
docs. And so this

1057
00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:20.344
is going to load

1058
00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:22.762
AI documentation from our

1059
00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:23.782
AI docs readme. It's

1060
00:24:23.782 --> 00:24:24.701
gonna read through all

1061
00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:25.701
of these items. We

1062
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:27.020
can load up the

1063
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.401
AI docs reusable prompt

1064
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.019
and it's going to

1065
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.299
kick off sub agents
WEBVTT

1065
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.299
kick off sub agents

1066
00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:30.699
to do this work

1067
00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:31.719
for us. So our

1068
00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:32.798
primary agents reading this

1069
00:24:32.798 --> 00:24:33.518
file and it's gonna

1070
00:24:33.518 --> 00:24:34.897
kick off however many

1071
00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:36.356
agents we need to

1072
00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:37.695
to fetch every one

1073
00:24:37.695 --> 00:24:38.875
of our AI doc

1074
00:24:39.016 --> 00:24:40.035
URLs, right? So it

1075
00:24:40.035 --> 00:24:40.535
looks like, I don't

1076
00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:40.894
know, what do we

1077
00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:41.594
have here, 10 or

1078
00:24:41.594 --> 00:24:42.534
11? You can see

1079
00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:43.034
this is gonna get

1080
00:24:43.034 --> 00:24:43.772
kicked up here pretty

1081
00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:44.673
soon after we do

1082
00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:45.832
a date check on

1083
00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:46.821
any file here that's

1084
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:47.671
old than 24 hours,

1085
00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:48.490
which I think all

1086
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:48.950
of them are at

1087
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.868
this point. And so

1088
00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:50.508
you can see it's

1089
00:24:50.567 --> 00:24:51.886
removing these and then

1090
00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:52.605
it's going to fire

1091
00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:53.924
up these agents to

1092
00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:55.883
reload our AI docs.

1093
00:24:55.922 --> 00:24:56.622
There it is, doc

1094
00:24:56.622 --> 00:24:57.641
scraper. And this is

1095
00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:58.858
critical, right? A web

1096
00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.678
scrape can consume quite
WEBVTT

1096
00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.678
scrape can consume quite

1097
00:25:00.817 --> 00:25:01.996
a bit of tokens.

1098
00:25:02.036 --> 00:25:02.694
And so we have

1099
00:25:02.694 --> 00:25:04.094
this load AI docs,

1100
00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:06.393
reusable agentic prompt that's

1101
00:25:06.393 --> 00:25:07.292
gonna kick this off.

1102
00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:07.971
You can see that

1103
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:08.892
the token's starting to

1104
00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:09.830
tick up. We already

1105
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.131
have 3K for each

1106
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:12.410
agent. This is 3K

1107
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.489
tokens times eight or

1108
00:25:14.489 --> 00:25:16.307
10 that isn't added

1109
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:18.067
to our primary agent.

1110
00:25:18.346 --> 00:25:20.766
This is sub-agent delegation.

1111
00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:21.945
We're leveraging the context

1112
00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:24.125

keep it out of

1115
00:25:26.284 --> 00:25:28.282
our primary agent. In

1116
00:25:28.282 --> 00:25:29.281
this case, this is

1117
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:30.261
a great use case
WEBVTT

1117
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:30.261
a great use case

1118
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:31.681
for sub-agents. We have

1119
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:33.420
this workflow where Dock

1121
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.598
have this system prompt

1122
00:25:35.598 --> 00:25:37.498
here that details exactly

1123
00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:38.817
how to web scrape

1124
00:25:38.938 --> 00:25:41.376
with Firecrawl or Webfetch,

1125
00:25:41.537 --> 00:25:42.796
right? Whatever web scraping

1126
00:25:42.816 --> 00:25:44.236
tool you wanna use,

1127
00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:45.315
it has it here.

1128
00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:45.734
This would be a

1129
00:25:45.734 --> 00:25:46.753
good example for us

1130
00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:47.753
to fire up and

1131
00:25:47.753 --> 00:25:50.272
load that one MCP

1133
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:52.692
agents are just going

1134
00:25:52.692 --> 00:25:53.711
to run the scrape,

1135
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.871
which will consume their

1136
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:55.970
context window. And then

1137
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.990
they're going to write

1138
00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:58.001
the output files, right?

1139
00:25:58.001 --> 00:25:58.560

1143
00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:03.378

classic workflow we use

00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.101
a lot throughout TAC

00:26:33.101 --> 00:26:34.000
and throughout our extended

1167
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.939
lessons. So you can

1168
00:26:34.939 --> 00:26:35.919
see here all the

1169
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:37.597
tokens that were not

1170
00:26:37.617 --> 00:26:38.797
added to my primary

1171
00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.757
agents context window. We

1172
00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:40.676
can of course slash

1173
00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.936
context to prove that

1174
00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:43.276
we're only up to

1175
00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:44.996
9K tokens, okay? We

1176
00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:46.296
delegated work, right? We're

1177
00:26:46.296 --> 00:26:47.634
stepping into the D

1178
00:26:47.634 --> 00:26:48.414
in the R and

1179
00:26:48.434 --> 00:26:49.714
D framework. There's only

1180
00:26:49.714 --> 00:26:51.255
two ways to manage

1181
00:26:51.255 --> 00:26:52.534
your context window, reduce

1182
00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:54.416
context, entering your primary

agent and delegate context

1184
00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:57.815
to sub-agents and as

you'll see in upcoming

1186

techniques to other primary

1187
00:27:00.873 --> 00:27:03.092
agents. CloudCo sub-agents have

1188
00:27:03.092 --> 00:27:04.711
limitations. Sub-agents sit at

1189
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.069
the intermediate level for

1190
00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:07.328
a reason because instead

1191
00:27:07.328 --> 00:27:08.048
of keeping track of

1192
00:27:08.048 --> 00:27:09.367
just one set of

1193
00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:11.227
context model prompting tools,

1194
00:27:11.247 --> 00:27:12.306
the core four, we

1195
00:27:12.306 --> 00:27:12.925
now have to keep

1196
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:14.365
track of as many

1197
00:27:14.365 --> 00:27:16.344
as you spawn sub-agents.

1198
00:27:16.364 --> 00:27:17.083
So it becomes super

1199
00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:18.961
important to isolate the

1200
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.094
work that your sub-agents

1201
00:27:20.094 --> 00:27:21.153
are doing into one

1202
00:27:21.153 --> 00:27:23.113
concise prompt to one

1203
00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:25.173
focused effort. Remember, a

1204
00:27:25.173 --> 00:27:26.632
focused agent is a

1205
00:27:26.632 --> 00:27:28.571
performant agent. Sub-agents are

1206
00:27:28.571 --> 00:27:29.852
also a little trickier

1207
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.010
because of the flow
WEBVTT

1207
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.010
because of the flow

1208
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.030
of information. The flow

1209
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.070
of information in these

1210
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.210
multi-agent systems is critical.

1211
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.761
Your primary agent, is

1212
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:39.721
prompting your sub-agents and

1213
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:41.661
your sub-agents are responding

1214
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.880
not to you but

1215
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.420
back to your primary

1216
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.420
agent. So once we

1217
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.439
start getting into this

1218
00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:48.358
intermediate, advanced, and agentic

1219
00:27:48.358 --> 00:27:49.317
level, we have to

1220
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:50.998
keep track of every

1221
00:27:50.998 --> 00:27:52.696
agent's core four that

1222
00:27:52.696 --> 00:27:53.596
we spin up. If

1223
00:27:53.596 --> 00:27:54.196
you're losing track of

1224
00:27:54.196 --> 00:27:55.257
a single agent, right,

1225
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:55.655
and you have a

1226
00:27:55.655 --> 00:27:57.236
bunch of wasted context,

1227
00:27:57.296 --> 00:27:58.715
you probably aren't yet

1228
00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:00.055
ready for sub-agents. You
WEBVTT

1228
00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:00.055
ready for sub-agents. You

1229
00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:00.775
probably want to spend

1230
00:28:00.775 --> 00:28:01.775
some more time cleaning

1231
00:28:01.775 --> 00:28:03.773
up, managing, and maintaining

1232
00:28:03.894 --> 00:28:05.532
clean context windows for

1233
00:28:05.532 --> 00:28:07.412
your existing single primary

1234
00:28:07.412 --> 00:28:08.211
agent. But once you're

1235
00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:09.490
ready, sub agents are

1236
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.250
a great intermediate level,

1237
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.588
a great intermediate technique

1238
00:28:12.588 --> 00:28:14.127
to step into because

1239
00:28:14.127 --> 00:28:15.327
you can delegate the

1240
00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:17.365
entire context window to

1241
00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:19.025
one or more sub

1242
00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:19.964
agents. As you saw

1243
00:28:19.984 --> 00:28:21.463
here, we say probably

1244
00:28:21.463 --> 00:28:23.903
40,000 total tokens and

1245
00:28:23.903 --> 00:28:25.122
ran all this work

1246
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:26.401
much faster than it

1247
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:27.240
would have taken a

1248
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.599
single primary agent. So

1249
00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:29.739
next up, we have

1250
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:32.317
a powerful classic pattern.
WEBVTT

1250

1251
00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:36.417
We're continuing to push

1252
00:28:36.417 --> 00:28:38.136
into the delegation side

1253
00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:39.435
of the R&D framework.

1254
00:28:39.435 --> 00:28:40.496
You can have two

agents working side by

1256
00:28:42.214 --> 00:28:43.933
side. One agent plans,

1257
00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.433
the other agent executes

1258
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:46.153
the plan. You have

1259
00:28:46.153 --> 00:28:47.272
a planner and a

1260
00:28:47.272 --> 00:28:49.011
builder, an architect and

1261
00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:49.751
an editor. This is

1262
00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:51.851
a classic prompt chaining

1263
00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:53.269
technique that expands and

1264
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:55.749
extrapolates very well into

1272
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.730
all it does is

1273
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.269
if we open up

1274
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:06.828
a quick plan, this

1275
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:08.828
accepts a single argument,

1276
00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:09.528
which is the user

1277
00:29:09.528 --> 00:29:10.887
prompt. Inside of TAC,

1278
00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:11.728
you're very familiar with

1279
00:29:11.728 --> 00:29:12.948
this pattern. We built

1280
00:29:12.948 --> 00:29:14.387
out and extrapolated on

1281
00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:15.666
this in the software

1284
00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:19.207
plan is roughly the

1285
00:29:19.207 --> 00:29:20.486
same idea. You have

1286
00:29:20.486 --> 00:29:21.685
a single prompt that's

1287
00:29:21.685 --> 00:29:23.724
focused on just planning.

1288
00:29:23.724 --> 00:29:24.503

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.598
small reusable codebase

1294
00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:32.897
inside of our application

1295
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:34.316
layer. So app slash

1296
00:29:34.316 --> 00:29:36.055
CCTS wrapper. Okay, so

1297
00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:36.714
let's fire that off

1298
00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:38.457
this agent. is only

1299
00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:39.576
going to plan. And

1300
00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:40.115
now, as you can

1301
00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:41.275
imagine, if our agent

1302
00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:41.973
on the left is

1303
00:29:41.973 --> 00:29:43.133
only planning, we have

1304
00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:44.771
a completely free context

1305
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:45.691
window on the right

1306
00:29:45.711 --> 00:29:47.190
to build. Okay. And

1307
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.690
so we of course

1308
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.989
have slash build. We

1309
00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:49.907
can then take this

1310
00:29:49.907 --> 00:29:51.986
build command and execute

1311
00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:53.285
it on the plan

1312
00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:54.763
generated by our plan

1313
00:29:54.824 --> 00:29:55.702
agent. So we're going

1314
00:29:55.702 --> 00:29:56.602
to let this agent

1315
00:29:56.602 --> 00:29:57.901
cook. And as you

1316
00:29:57.901 --> 00:29:58.840
can see, we are

1317
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.538
continuing to reduce context
WEBVTT

1317
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.538
continuing to reduce context

1318
00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:03.250
windows and delegate work

1319
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.388
between agents. The idea

1320
00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:07.308
here is simple. Separate

1321
00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.748
your agents responsibilities. Why?

1322
00:30:09.768 --> 00:30:11.326
Because especially for your

1323
00:30:11.326 --> 00:30:13.047
implementer, AKA your editor

1324
00:30:13.067 --> 00:30:14.326
and builder agent, you

1325
00:30:14.326 --> 00:30:16.546
want their context focused

1326
00:30:16.546 --> 00:30:17.105
so they can make

1327
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.825
surgical perfect error free

1328
00:30:19.825 --> 00:30:20.924
edits. A lot of

1329
00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:22.644
engineers are stacking up

1330
00:30:22.644 --> 00:30:23.943
a chat window. They're

1331
00:30:23.943 --> 00:30:26.042
prompt chaining inside of

1332
00:30:26.042 --> 00:30:27.163
a single agents chat

1333
00:30:27.163 --> 00:30:28.042
window over and over

1334
00:30:28.042 --> 00:30:28.821
and over. And they're

1335
00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:30.193
not realizing that they're
WEBVTT

1335
00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:30.193
not realizing that they're

1336
00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:32.232
causing context rot and

1337
00:30:32.232 --> 00:30:33.672
context bloat with every

1338
00:30:33.672 --> 00:30:35.451
prompt that isn't laser

1339
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:36.891
focused to the task

1340
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:38.150
at hand. With our

1341
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.329
planning prompt, we have

1342
00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:40.848
a detailed prompt in

1343
00:30:40.848 --> 00:30:42.708
our classic instruction prompt

1344
00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:44.346
format. Again, check out

1345
00:30:44.507 --> 00:30:45.766
a Genetic Prompt Engineering

1346
00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:47.486
extended lesson on the

1347
00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.224
powerful prompt structures that

1348
00:30:49.224 --> 00:30:50.223
you can write. And

1349
00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:51.023
we're being very, very

1350
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:52.803
clear about what it

1351
00:30:52.803 --> 00:30:53.762
needs to do. We're

1352
00:30:53.843 --> 00:30:55.546
planning work. and we're

1353
00:30:55.546 --> 00:30:56.424
planning work with a

1354
00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:58.643
powerful Opus agent. Again,

1355
00:30:58.862 --> 00:30:59.281
if you're in the

1356
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:00.340
future, I hope you
WEBVTT

1356
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:00.340
future, I hope you

1357
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.299
have better, more powerful

1358
00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:02.857
models, use that. These

1359
00:31:02.877 --> 00:31:04.217
techniques are all the

1360
00:31:04.217 --> 00:31:05.576
same across models. Don't

1361
00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:06.194
get stuck up on

1362
00:31:06.234 --> 00:31:07.733
any one individual model,

1363
00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:08.333
but you can see

1364
00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.632
here our planner has

1365
00:31:09.632 --> 00:31:10.930
finished planning. Now we

1366
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.229
can just copy this

1367
00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:12.808
and we can be

1368
00:31:12.808 --> 00:31:14.027
very confident that whatever

1369
00:31:14.027 --> 00:31:15.425
is in here is

1370
00:31:15.586 --> 00:31:16.365
up to par with

1371
00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:17.964
our standards because we've

1372
00:31:17.984 --> 00:31:20.104
put upfront investment into

1373
00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:21.523
our planning phase. So

1374
00:31:21.523 --> 00:31:22.202
I can just copy

1375
00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:23.083
the reference to this

1376
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:23.663
and go to our

1377
00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:25.162
build agent, paste this

1378
00:31:25.162 --> 00:31:26.261
in, and with no

1379
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:27.520
context priming at all,

1380
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.941
everything the build agent

1381
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.559
needs is inside of
WEBVTT

1381
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.559
needs is inside of

1382
00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:31.539
this plan. It's all

1383
00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:32.558
there because our planner

1384
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:33.318
took care of that

1385
00:31:33.318 --> 00:31:35.157
for the builder, all

1386
00:31:35.157 --> 00:31:37.328
right? reducing context and

1387
00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:39.127
we're delegating context, right?

1388
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:39.847
You can see our

1389
00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:41.527
planner has consumed some

1390
00:31:41.527 --> 00:31:43.286
7k tokens here. We're

1391
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:43.945
in a very small

1392
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:44.766
codebase. And just

1393
00:31:44.766 --> 00:31:45.505
imagine that this is,

1394
00:31:45.505 --> 00:31:46.464
you know, a larger

1395
00:31:46.464 --> 00:31:48.003
task, right? 60,000 tokens,

1396
00:31:48.003 --> 00:31:48.824
whatever. You can be

1397
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.502
guaranteed that the tokens

1398
00:31:50.502 --> 00:31:52.061
used to plan, not

1399
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:53.061
all of that is

1400
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.560
critical for the building.

1401
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:56.101
And this makes sense.

1402
00:31:56.101 --> 00:31:57.240
When you're engineering, when

1403
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.778
you're writing plans, you

1404
00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.617
always go overboard. By
WEBVTT

1404
00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.617
always go overboard. By

1405
00:32:00.617 --> 00:32:01.077
the end of your

1406
00:32:01.077 --> 00:32:01.958
planning phase, you should

1407
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:03.457
be deleting information that

1408
00:32:03.457 --> 00:32:04.217
isn't relevant to the

1409
00:32:04.217 --> 00:32:05.756
work you want done.

1410
00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:06.496
You should go overboard,

1411
00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:07.755
then delete. Here we

1412
00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:09.173
have the R&D framework

1413
00:32:09.173 --> 00:32:10.313
in full swing. We're

1414
00:32:10.313 --> 00:32:12.071
delegating across two agents

1415
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:13.832
to reduce context when

1416
00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:14.770
it matters most. There

1417
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.431
are a lot of

1418
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.450
places where it matters,

1419
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.190
but when your agent

1420
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.828
is actually writing the

1421
00:32:18.828 --> 00:32:20.127
code, when they're actually

1422
00:32:20.127 --> 00:32:21.567
running your agentic workflows,

1423
00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:22.727
that's when it matters

1424
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:23.846
the most. And this

1425
00:32:23.846 --> 00:32:25.345
context window here that's

1426
00:32:25.345 --> 00:32:26.325
doing all this writing,

1427
00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:27.604
right, chewing up our

1428
00:32:27.604 --> 00:32:29.702
expensive output tokens, it's

1429
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:31.554
a focused agent with
WEBVTT

1429
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:31.554
a focused agent with

1430
00:32:31.554 --> 00:32:33.311
a focused context window,

1431
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:34.490
and that means it

1432
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.910
is a performant agent.

1433
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.630
All right, and just

1434
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.449
to detail that prompt

1435
00:32:37.449 --> 00:32:38.208
a little bit more,

1436
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:39.487
if we run up

1437
00:32:39.487 --> 00:32:40.326
a little bit, here's

1438
00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.165
what this agent is

1439
00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:42.065
planning, just to give

1440
00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:42.505
a little bit of

1441
00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:43.903
more additional context here,

1442
00:32:43.923 --> 00:32:45.042
right? Quite simple, so

1443
00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:46.182
quick plan, and then

1444
00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:46.980
here's the prompt that

1445
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.440
we're actually executing. Read

1446
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.718
TypeScript SDK, create reusable,

1447
00:32:50.817 --> 00:32:51.997
three file wrapper system

1448
00:32:51.997 --> 00:32:53.116
for calling agents via

1449
00:32:53.116 --> 00:32:54.895
Claude Code, TypeScript SDK.

1450
00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:56.035
Here are some methods,

1451
00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:57.234
types file, low level,

1452
00:32:57.414 --> 00:32:58.814
CLI file, create this

1453
00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:00.074
in this directory. All
WEBVTT

1453
00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:00.074
in this directory. All

1454
00:33:00.074 --> 00:33:00.472
right, so just a

1455
00:33:00.472 --> 00:33:01.373
simple kind of high

1456
00:33:01.373 --> 00:33:02.452
mid-level prompt and our

1457
00:33:02.452 --> 00:33:03.852
builder has finished implementing.

1458
00:33:03.852 --> 00:33:04.711
We can just open

1459
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.711
up this directory and

1460
00:33:05.711 --> 00:33:06.391
we can see exactly

1461
00:33:06.391 --> 00:33:07.509
what was created. There's

1462
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:09.189
our hello calls and

1463
00:33:09.189 --> 00:33:09.969
then inside of this

1464
00:33:09.969 --> 00:33:10.929
directory, you can see

1465
00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:11.867
here we have a

1466
00:33:11.867 --> 00:33:13.188
full on application built

1467
00:33:13.188 --> 00:33:13.727
out. We can of

1468
00:33:13.727 --> 00:33:15.925
course, TD apps, CC,

1469
00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:17.984
bun run tab. There's

1470
00:33:17.984 --> 00:33:19.763
everything our bun ecosystem

1471
00:33:19.763 --> 00:33:20.824
is giving us. we

1472
00:33:20.824 --> 00:33:22.044
can just run, run

1473
00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:22.983
dev, looks like a

1474
00:33:22.983 --> 00:33:25.124
media prompt, hello, enter,

1475
00:33:25.124 --> 00:33:25.784
and now the Cloud

1476
00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:27.563
Code SDK via TypeScript

1477
00:33:27.603 --> 00:33:28.262
is running. There's the

1478
00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:30.363
response session ID, fantastic,
WEBVTT

1478
00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:30.363
response session ID, fantastic,

1479
00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:31.123
there we go. So

1480
00:33:31.222 --> 00:33:32.762
simple prompt, simple planner,

1481
00:33:32.762 --> 00:33:35.002
builder workflow, architect, editor,

1482
00:33:35.002 --> 00:33:36.742
delegating across two context

1483
00:33:36.762 --> 00:33:40.942
windows. Let's take our

1484
00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:42.521
builder and let's run

1485
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.961
a very well-meaning feature

1486
00:33:45.001 --> 00:33:45.821
inside of Cloud Code.

1487
00:33:45.862 --> 00:33:47.261
A very powerful, useful

1488
00:33:47.261 --> 00:33:50.150
feature slash compact. Okay,

1489
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:51.449
so you've probably used

1490
00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:52.368
this one, but there's

1491
00:33:52.368 --> 00:33:53.209
a huge problem with

1492
00:33:53.209 --> 00:33:54.907
this command. After compact

1493
00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:56.407
runs, do you know

1494
00:33:56.407 --> 00:33:58.067
exactly what's in your

1495
00:33:58.067 --> 00:33:59.807
context window every single

1496
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.885
time? Now, the answer
WEBVTT

1496
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.885
time? Now, the answer

1497
00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:01.405
to this is of

1498
00:34:01.405 --> 00:34:03.384
course, no. You don't

1499
00:34:03.384 --> 00:34:04.345
know, I don't know.

1500
00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:04.724
We have to hit

1501
00:34:04.724 --> 00:34:06.763
Control R and reread

1502
00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:08.702
through what this compact

1503
00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:09.742
ended up doing. When

1504
00:34:09.742 --> 00:34:10.460
you get to advanced

1505
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.840
agent decoding, it's time

1506
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.300
to stop guessing and

1507
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.918
start knowing. I avoid

1508
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:16.257
compact and I recommend

1509
00:34:16.257 --> 00:34:17.556
that you reset and

1510
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:18.476
prime. You know, we

1511
00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:19.235
can hit Control R

1512
00:34:19.235 --> 00:34:20.215
here. We can see

1513
00:34:20.215 --> 00:34:21.735
a decent summary here,

1514
00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:22.914
right? Some nine step

1515
00:34:22.914 --> 00:34:24.193
summary. You can imagine

1516
00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:25.152
the Claude Code engineers

1517
00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:25.833
have some type of

1518
00:34:25.833 --> 00:34:27.492
prompt that generates a

1519
00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:29.391
step-by-step workflow. You can

1520
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.590
see it is summarizing.
WEBVTT

1520
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.590
see it is summarizing.

1521
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.009
decently here. Usually it

1522
00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:32.768
has some type of

1523
00:34:32.807 --> 00:34:34.106
read file command where

1524
00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:35.605
it automatically read some

1525
00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:36.903
additional files, right? You

1526
00:34:36.903 --> 00:34:37.523
know, you can understand

1527
00:34:37.523 --> 00:34:38.262
why they did this.

1528
00:34:38.262 --> 00:34:39.001
The context window is

1529
00:34:39.001 --> 00:34:40.260
limited. They're facing the

1530
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.539
same limitations as you

1531
00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:42.159
and I, and they

1532
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.157
want to provide solutions

1533
00:34:43.157 --> 00:34:44.257
for them. But just

1534
00:34:44.257 --> 00:34:45.335
like your prompts, the

1535
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:46.713
context window of your

1536
00:34:46.713 --> 00:34:48.253
agents should not be

1537
00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:49.650
handed off to any

1538
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.494
tool or team. The

1539
00:34:51.494 --> 00:34:52.833
compact command for what

1540
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:53.931
it's worth is great,

1541
00:34:53.972 --> 00:34:54.851
but it's a bandaid

1542
00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:55.889
fix for the true

1543
00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.568
problem. The context window

1544
00:34:57.568 --> 00:34:58.728
has grown large and

1545
00:34:58.728 --> 00:35:00.606
cannot fit any additional
WEBVTT

1545
00:34:58.728 --> 00:35:00.606
cannot fit any additional

1546
00:35:00.606 --> 00:35:02.485
information. Instead of compacting,

1547
00:35:02.605 --> 00:35:03.804
instead of running slash

1548
00:35:03.804 --> 00:35:05.282
compact, I recommend you

1549
00:35:05.282 --> 00:35:09.139
run slash clear. Blow

1550
00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:10.298
away the context window

1551
00:35:10.378 --> 00:35:11.802
completely. Now if we

1552
00:35:11.802 --> 00:35:13.641
run slash context, we

1553
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:15.260
are running a fresh

1554
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.639
focused agent. Now reset

1555
00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:19.418
with slash prime, right?

1556
00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:20.797
Run whatever prime command

1557
00:35:20.797 --> 00:35:22.996
you're running and refocus

1558
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:24.215
on your task at

1559
00:35:24.215 --> 00:35:25.396
hand, right? Build back

1560
00:35:25.396 --> 00:35:25.875
up to where you

1561
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:27.733
were and continue forward.

1562
00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:28.253
I know this one

1563
00:35:28.253 --> 00:35:29.333
doesn't sound great. It's

1564
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.452
like the first advanced
WEBVTT

1564
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.452
like the first advanced

1565
00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:32.012
technique, basically just saying

1566
00:35:32.112 --> 00:35:33.012
do more work. Don't

1567
00:35:33.012 --> 00:35:33.731
depend on the slash

1568
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.990
compact command. Why do

1569
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.731
we do this? It's

1570
00:35:35.731 --> 00:35:36.730
because this way you

1571
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.630
know exactly what's in

1572
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.168
your context window and

1573
00:35:39.168 --> 00:35:39.648
you get in the

1574
00:35:39.648 --> 00:35:41.487
habit of building tasks

1575
00:35:41.507 --> 00:35:43.927
specific context priming prompts,

1576
00:35:43.987 --> 00:35:44.768
all right? Just like

1577
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:46.507
our beginner techniques adjust.

1578
00:35:46.547 --> 00:35:47.786
These techniques stack up

1579
00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:48.746
on each other very,

1580
00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:49.927
very quickly. The big

1581
00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:50.586
idea here is you

1582
00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:52.007
don't wanna delegate the

1583
00:35:52.007 --> 00:35:53.786
control of your context

1584
00:35:53.786 --> 00:35:54.585
window, all right? This

1585
00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.505
is a dangerous game

1586
00:35:55.505 --> 00:35:56.585
to play. You want

1587
00:35:56.606 --> 00:35:57.606
to own this just

1588
00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:58.786
like you wanna control

1589
00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.057
your prompt or your
WEBVTT

1589
00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.057
your prompt or your

1590
00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.757
model, the context window

1591
00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:02.715
is the same. This

1592
00:36:02.715 --> 00:36:04.076
is also important for

1593
00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:05.815
Outloop agent decoding, right?

1594
00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:06.793
It prepares you for

1595
00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:08.172
Outloop agent decoding. And

1596
00:36:08.172 --> 00:36:08.913
for this to work

1597
00:36:09.012 --> 00:36:10.052
at high levels across

1598
00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:12.050
hundreds of agent executions,

1599
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.889
you need specialized agents

1600
00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:15.070
you know what the

1601
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.349
context will be if

1602
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:18.168
a compact command runs

1603
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:19.349
you can't know this

1604
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:20.768
with high confidence for

1605
00:36:20.768 --> 00:36:22.429
outloop agent decoding no

1606
00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:24.608
single agent should overflow

1607
00:36:24.688 --> 00:36:26.188
their 200k tokens and

1608
00:36:26.188 --> 00:36:27.608
trigger a compact if

1609
00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:28.648
it does you should

1610
00:36:28.648 --> 00:36:29.887
chop up the task

1611
00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.427
you shouldn't need slash
WEBVTT

1611
00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.427
you shouldn't need slash

1612
00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:32.646
compact and if you

1613
00:36:32.646 --> 00:36:33.726
need to you should

1614
00:36:33.726 --> 00:36:35.567
reset and prime now

1615
00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:36.465
we can push this

1616
00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.405
idea a little bit

1617
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:38.626
further and try to

1618
00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:40.137
do what the compact

1619
00:36:40.137 --> 00:36:41.836
window command is doing

1620
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:43.476
ourselves with our next

1621
00:36:43.516 --> 00:36:45.476
advanced context engineering technique.

1622
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:49.414
Notice that with each

1623
00:36:49.414 --> 00:36:50.375
technique from beginner to

1624
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.974
intermediate to advanced and

1625
00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.414
soon agentic, we're doing

1626
00:36:53.474 --> 00:36:54.693
R and D, reduce

1627
00:36:54.693 --> 00:36:55.833
and delegate. We're keeping

1628
00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:56.833
track of our context

1629
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:57.693
window at all times

1630
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:58.932
and we're not outsourcing

1631
00:36:58.932 --> 00:36:59.432
it. If you wanna

1632
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:01.152
scale your agents, monitoring
WEBVTT

1632
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:01.152
scale your agents, monitoring

1633
00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.652
and managing the state

1634
00:37:02.652 --> 00:37:03.751
of your context window

1635
00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:04.971
is critical for your

1636
00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:06.471
success, all right? Just

1637
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:07.730
like context priming, you

1638
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.989
can push in loop

1639
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.320
active context management even

1640
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.699
further with context bundles.

1641
00:37:13.818 --> 00:37:15.038
Okay. So with Cloud

1642
00:37:15.038 --> 00:37:16.117
Code hooks, you can

1643
00:37:16.117 --> 00:37:17.376
hook into a couple

1644
00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:18.496
of tool calls to

1645
00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:20.135
create a trail of

1646
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.175
work that you can

1647
00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:23.072
use to reprime your

1648
00:37:23.072 --> 00:37:24.371
agents for the next

1649
00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:24.972
run, right? So you

1650
00:37:24.972 --> 00:37:26.291
can chain together agents

1651
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:27.710
after the context window

1652
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.168
has exploded. So the

1653
00:37:29.168 --> 00:37:29.969
great part here is

1654
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:31.007
we've been using context

1654
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:31.007
we've been using context

1655
00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:32.586
bundles the entire time.

1656
00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:33.786
So let's collapse everything

1657
00:37:33.786 --> 00:37:35.617
and open up agents

1658
00:37:35.637 --> 00:37:36.858
and so agents is

1659
00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:38.697
becoming a additional agentic

1660
00:37:38.697 --> 00:37:40.476
layer directory where you

1661
00:37:40.476 --> 00:37:41.516
can just put output

1662
00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:43.036
from operations of your

1663
00:37:43.036 --> 00:37:43.817
agents. You can see

1664
00:37:43.817 --> 00:37:44.755
we have background and

1665
00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:45.856
we have context bundles.

1666
00:37:45.856 --> 00:37:46.956
Let's click into bundles

1667
00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:47.735
and let's see what

1668
00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:48.695
we have in this

1669
00:37:48.695 --> 00:37:49.976
directory. All right, so

1670
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:50.896
if we click this

1671
00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:51.914
bundle, we have something

1672
00:37:51.914 --> 00:37:52.855
super simple. We have

1673
00:37:52.855 --> 00:37:53.974
slash prime and we

1674
00:37:53.974 --> 00:37:54.954
have read. If we

1675
00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:56.735
click into this context

1676
00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:57.494
bundle, you can see

1677
00:37:57.494 --> 00:37:58.414
we have our quick

1678
00:37:58.414 --> 00:37:59.634
plan. So this was

1679
00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:00.514
the work that happened
WEBVTT

1679
00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:00.514
the work that happened

1680
00:38:00.514 --> 00:38:01.534
inside of our planner.

1681
00:38:01.826 --> 00:38:02.865
It read the file

1682
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:03.844
as specified and then

1683
00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:05.164
it wrote this plan

1684
00:38:05.164 --> 00:38:05.945
here for us, right?

1685
00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:07.324
And we have the

1686
00:38:07.324 --> 00:38:08.264
tool input and we

1687
00:38:08.264 --> 00:38:09.023
have a couple of

1688
00:38:09.023 --> 00:38:09.864
other things, right? This

1689
00:38:09.864 --> 00:38:10.704
is powerful. This is

1690
00:38:10.704 --> 00:38:12.123
a context bundle. What

1691
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.224
we have here is

1692
00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.762
a simple append only

1693
00:38:14.762 --> 00:38:16.143
log of the work

1694
00:38:16.302 --> 00:38:17.003
that our Claude Code

1695
00:38:17.043 --> 00:38:18.481
instances are doing. These

1696
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:19.362
are unique based on

1697
00:38:19.362 --> 00:38:20.534
the day and the

1698
00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:21.773
hour and the session

1699
00:38:21.773 --> 00:38:23.273
ID, okay? So how

1700
00:38:23.273 --> 00:38:24.152
does this work exactly?

1701
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:25.411
Fire up a YOLO

1702
00:38:25.492 --> 00:38:26.871
dangerous mode instance and

1703
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.789
we just type prime,

1704
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.929
right? Let's just rerun

1705
00:38:28.949 --> 00:38:29.630
a prime and let's

1706
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.309
prime our Claude Code,
WEBVTT

1706
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.309
prime our Claude Code,

1707
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.047
right? So we're running

1708
00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:32.768
our prime command around

1709
00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:33.527
Claude Code and you

1710
00:38:33.527 --> 00:38:34.467
can see this context

1711
00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:35.907
bundle was generated, okay?

1712
00:38:36.027 --> 00:38:36.925
So there's the prompt

1713
00:38:37.045 --> 00:38:38.304
and let's just pay

1714
00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:39.065
attention to what this

1715
00:38:39.065 --> 00:38:40.065
does, all right? We

1716
00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:40.943
have read commands, we

1717
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.143
have search commands. Our

1718
00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:43.003
read commands are all

1719
00:38:43.003 --> 00:38:44.443
getting appended piece by

1720
00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:45.521
piece and what this

1721
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:46.521
does is it gives

1722
00:38:46.521 --> 00:38:48.661
us a solid understanding

1723
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.719
of 60, 70, percent

1724
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.840
of what our previous

1725
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.420
agents have done okay

1726
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.219
and so why is

1727
00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:55.039
this important this is

1728
00:38:55.039 --> 00:38:56.018
important because it tells

1729
00:38:56.018 --> 00:38:57.679
a fuller story for

1730
00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:59.278
subsequent agents to execute

1731
00:38:59.278 --> 00:38:59.818
there's a bunch of

1732
00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:01.878
additional read commands and
WEBVTT

1732
00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:01.878
additional read commands and

1733
00:39:01.878 --> 00:39:03.139
we're getting a log

1734
00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:03.938
right we're getting a

1735
00:39:03.938 --> 00:39:06.237
full-on context bundle of

1736
00:39:06.237 --> 00:39:08.797
our agents context window

1737
00:39:08.938 --> 00:39:09.757
Okay, this is a

1738
00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:12.036
very simple yet powerful

1739
00:39:12.036 --> 00:39:12.855
idea you can use

1740
00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:14.534
to remount instances to

1741
00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:15.193
get them into the

1742
00:39:15.193 --> 00:39:17.192
exact same state after

1743
00:39:17.192 --> 00:39:18.552
their context window has

1744
00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:19.731
exploded. It also gives

1745
00:39:19.731 --> 00:39:21.170
us a story because

1746
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.969
we have the prompt

1747
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:23.628
operation in here about

1748
00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:25.027
what the context is

1749
00:39:25.027 --> 00:39:26.186
and why the context

1750
00:39:26.186 --> 00:39:27.166
is that way based

1751
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.065
on our user prompt.

1752
00:39:28.105 --> 00:39:29.423
Okay, so we have

1753
00:39:29.423 --> 00:39:30.364
this now, great, who
WEBVTT

1753
00:39:29.423 --> 00:39:30.364
this now, great, who

1754
00:39:30.364 --> 00:39:31.463
cares? Let's open up

1755
00:39:31.463 --> 00:39:32.041
a new Claude Code

1756
00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:33.501
instance. And let's say

1757
00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:34.420
that this, you know,

1758
00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.858
this agent's context window

1759
00:39:35.858 --> 00:39:37.277
exploded. We can, with

1760
00:39:37.277 --> 00:39:38.697
this context bundle, run

1761
00:39:38.795 --> 00:39:41.534
slash load bundle, copy

1762
00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:42.753
the path, paste it,

1763
00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:44.771
hit enter. This agent

1764
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:45.349
is now going to

1765
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.489
get the full story

1766
00:39:46.548 --> 00:39:47.409
of the previous agent.

1767
00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:48.947
It's gonna deduplicate any

1768
00:39:48.947 --> 00:39:50.025
read commands. And then

1769
00:39:50.025 --> 00:39:51.025
it's going to create

1770
00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:52.664
an understanding of the

1771
00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:53.943
work done up till

1772
00:39:53.943 --> 00:39:55.405
this point. Okay, and

1773
00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:56.204
so imagine this is

1774
00:39:56.204 --> 00:39:57.324
much larger, right? Let's

1775
00:39:57.344 --> 00:39:58.103
say that it's something

1776
00:39:58.103 --> 00:39:59.483
like, you know, 50

1777
00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:01.101
plus lines of reads
WEBVTT

1777
00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:01.101
plus lines of reads

1778
00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:02.001
and writes. We can

1779
00:40:02.001 --> 00:40:03.699
use a context bundle

1780
00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:04.398
to get a much

1781
00:40:04.398 --> 00:40:05.978
more accurate replay of

1782
00:40:05.978 --> 00:40:06.838
what the previous agent

1783
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:07.396
was trying to do.

1784
00:40:07.396 --> 00:40:07.996
You can see here

1785
00:40:07.996 --> 00:40:09.016
in the summary message,

1786
00:40:09.056 --> 00:40:10.235
very concisely, the previous

1787
00:40:10.235 --> 00:40:11.634
agent executed this command

1788
00:40:11.693 --> 00:40:13.132
and loaded key findings.

1789
00:40:13.132 --> 00:40:14.492
That's it, nine files.

1790
00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.152
You can imagine this

1791
00:40:15.152 --> 00:40:15.851
getting a lot more

1792
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.730
complicated with reads, writes,

1793
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:19.248
and additional prompts, but

1794
00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:21.327
with this simple pattern,

1795
00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:23.166
with this session ID,

1796
00:40:23.297 --> 00:40:24.894
getting tracked here inside

1797
00:40:24.894 --> 00:40:25.833
of this context bundle.

1798
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:27.110
We're saving a concise

1799
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.628
execution log, thanks to

1800
00:40:28.628 --> 00:40:29.786
Claude Code Hooks that

1801
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.003
we can reference in
WEBVTT

1801
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.003
we can reference in

1802
00:40:31.003 --> 00:40:33.206
subsequent agents. And the

1803
00:40:33.206 --> 00:40:33.905
great part here is

1804
00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:34.945
of course you can

1805
00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:36.483
conditionally use this. A

1806
00:40:36.483 --> 00:40:37.083
lot of the times

1807
00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:37.862
you won't need to

1808
00:40:37.862 --> 00:40:39.503
reload the entire context

1809
00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.641
bundle because it won't

1810
00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:41.402
be relevant. But if

1811
00:40:41.402 --> 00:40:42.260
we needed to, we

1812
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.141
could get the entire

1813
00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.159
replay of the agent

1814
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.159
up to the point

1815
00:40:46.298 --> 00:40:47.619
in which the context

1816
00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.277
overloaded without all of

1817
00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:50.597
the rights and without

1818
00:40:50.597 --> 00:40:52.217
all the details of

1819
00:40:52.217 --> 00:40:53.436
all the reads. The

1820
00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:54.815
trimmed down version is

1821
00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:56.014
super important, right? We're

1822
00:40:56.014 --> 00:40:57.753
not recording every operation.

1823
00:40:57.793 --> 00:40:58.333
If we do that,

1824
00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:59.092
we'll just end up

1825
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:00.893
overflowing the next agent's
WEBVTT

1825
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:00.893
overflowing the next agent's

1826
00:41:00.893 --> 00:41:02.411
context window. Okay. So

1827
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:02.951
you do have to

1828
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.369
use this selectively, but

1829
00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:06.588
this gets us 70%

1830
00:41:06.588 --> 00:41:07.847
of where the previous

1831
00:41:07.847 --> 00:41:08.826
agent was. It gets

1832
00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:10.623
us mounted and restarted

1833
00:41:10.684 --> 00:41:11.563
very quickly. This is

1834
00:41:11.563 --> 00:41:13.342
another advanced contact engineering

1835
00:41:13.342 --> 00:41:14.601
technique you can use.

1836
00:41:14.601 --> 00:41:15.199
Check out this code

1837
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:16.199
base for the details

1838
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:17.538
on how exactly this

1839
00:41:17.538 --> 00:41:22.217
works. Our last advanced

1840
00:41:22.257 --> 00:41:23.657
technique is simple. It's

1841
00:41:23.657 --> 00:41:24.336
a simple idea, it's

1842
00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:25.596
a beautiful idea, continues

1843
00:41:25.596 --> 00:41:26.235
to build on the

1844
00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:27.376
techniques we've worked up

1845
00:41:27.376 --> 00:41:28.556
to use one agent

1846
00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:29.934
for one purpose. Maybe

1847
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:30.534
you've picked up on
WEBVTT

1847
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:30.534
you've picked up on

1848
00:41:30.534 --> 00:41:31.335
this with some of

1849
00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:32.454
the repeat themes that

1850
00:41:32.454 --> 00:41:33.434
we're getting into, but

1851
00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:34.554
there's no better way

1852
00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:35.853
to control and manage

1853
00:41:35.853 --> 00:41:37.333
your context window than

1854
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:39.052
to ship one thing

1855
00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:39.911
at a time. A

1856
00:41:39.911 --> 00:41:41.152
focus agent is a

1857
00:41:41.152 --> 00:41:43.271
performant agent. This advanced

1858
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:44.670
technique forces you to

1859
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.289
sit down and answer

1860
00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:47.829
the question, what does

1861
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:49.070
the pipeline of agents

1862
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.489
look like for this

1863
00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:51.889
work? Okay. Once you

1864
00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:52.989
start doing this well,

1865
00:41:53.009 --> 00:41:54.148
and you understand the

1866
00:41:54.148 --> 00:41:55.228
idea of using one

1867
00:41:55.228 --> 00:41:56.548
agent for one purpose,

1868
00:41:56.548 --> 00:41:57.708
if you've taken tack

1869
00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:58.987
lesson six, you know

1870
00:41:58.987 --> 00:42:00.007
the full version of
WEBVTT

1870
00:41:58.987 --> 00:42:00.007
the full version of

1871
00:42:00.007 --> 00:42:00.947
this, but once you

1872
00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:01.927
start doing this well,

1873
00:42:01.927 --> 00:42:02.947
you'll start engineering and

1874
00:42:02.947 --> 00:42:04.327
problem solving in this

1875
00:42:04.327 --> 00:42:06.286
two-step workflow. First, you

1876
00:42:06.286 --> 00:42:07.086
plan out the work

1877
00:42:07.086 --> 00:42:08.467
you want done without

1878
00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:10.387
regard for technology. Okay.

1879
00:42:10.387 --> 00:42:11.887
You'll focus on just

1880
00:42:11.887 --> 00:42:13.326
solving the problem for

1881
00:42:13.326 --> 00:42:14.346
your users, for your

1882
00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:16.286
customers, right? Always remember,

1883
00:42:16.385 --> 00:42:17.244
Your users and customers

1884
00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.483
come first. The technology

1885
00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:19.123
we use is a

1886
00:42:19.123 --> 00:42:20.621
means to this end.

1887
00:42:20.885 --> 00:42:22.105
Then you'll plan out

1888
00:42:22.224 --> 00:42:23.565
how you'll delegate your

1889
00:42:23.565 --> 00:42:26.402
work across several agents,

1890
00:42:26.402 --> 00:42:28.362
forming an agentic pipeline,

1891
00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:29.842
also known as an

1892
00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:31.800
AI developer workflow, the
WEBVTT

1892
00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:31.800
AI developer workflow, the

1893
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.699
highest level of agentic

1894
00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.599
coding leverage as discussed

1895
00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.719
in TAC. We'll move

1896
00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:37.297
on from this big

1897
00:42:37.297 --> 00:42:38.597
idea since it's the

1898
00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:40.056
key idea in TAC

1899
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:40.936
Lesson 6, but this

1900
00:42:40.936 --> 00:42:42.416
is a massive way

1901
00:42:42.416 --> 00:42:43.974
to manage your context

1902
00:42:43.974 --> 00:42:45.574
windows. This idea takes

1903
00:42:45.594 --> 00:42:46.914
agent delegation to its

1904
00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:49.592
natural, most valuable limit.

1905
00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:50.831
Use one agent for

1906
00:42:50.851 --> 00:42:52.231
one purpose so that

1907
00:42:52.231 --> 00:42:53.771
your context windows are

1908
00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.650
focused. A focused agent

1909
00:42:55.769 --> 00:42:57.168
is a performant agent.
WEBVTT

1910
00:43:00.246 --> 00:43:01.965
Now we've reached the

1911
00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:03.666
agentic level. Here you've

1912
00:43:03.666 --> 00:43:04.764
mastered all the previous

1913
00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:06.083
levels of context engineering.

1914
00:43:06.164 --> 00:43:07.364
This is where things

1915
00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:09.362
get powerful and dangerous

1916
00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:09.922
if you don't know

1917
00:43:09.922 --> 00:43:11.121
what you're doing because

1918
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.641
your patterns will start

1919
00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.280
to scale into the

1920
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.659
agentic workflows, into the

1921
00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:17.219
ADWs, into the pipelines

1922
00:43:17.398 --> 00:43:18.998
that you built. Okay.

1923
00:43:18.998 --> 00:43:20.070
So let's focus on

1924
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.768
the system prompt. You

1925
00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:23.907
can massively control Claude

1926
00:43:23.907 --> 00:43:25.226
Code's behavior and really

1927
00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:27.005
any agent's behavior. This

1928
00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:28.824
can completely change how

1929
00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.163
the tool works even
WEBVTT

1929
00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.163
the tool works even

1930
00:43:30.163 --> 00:43:31.182
more than Output Styles

1931
00:43:31.182 --> 00:43:32.782
because we can control

1932
00:43:32.782 --> 00:43:34.601
and start to overwrite

1933
00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:35.900
the default Claude Code

1934
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.938
behavior. I'll say it

1935
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.577
point blank, many engineers

1936
00:43:38.617 --> 00:43:39.217
will not get to

1937
00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:40.237
this level. Many engineers

1938
00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:42.115
don't need this level,

1939
00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:42.835
okay? But if you're

1940
00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:43.855
pushing to the edge,

1941
00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:45.173
the system prompt gives

1942
00:43:45.173 --> 00:43:47.257
you even more control

1943
00:43:47.356 --> 00:43:48.996
over your agent and

1944
00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:51.074
therefore the context flowing

1945
00:43:51.074 --> 00:43:52.452
in and out of

1946
00:43:52.452 --> 00:43:53.253
your agent. If you

1947
00:43:53.253 --> 00:43:53.972
start down the path

1948
00:43:53.972 --> 00:43:55.090
of agentic engineering, at

1949
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.210
some point, you will

1950
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.329
need to crack open

1951
00:43:57.329 --> 00:43:59.108
and modify the system

1952
00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:00.128
prompt. This is how
WEBVTT

1952
00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:00.128
prompt. This is how

1953
00:44:00.128 --> 00:44:01.487
you build your agents

1954
00:44:01.646 --> 00:44:03.365
and gain find tune

1955
00:44:03.385 --> 00:44:05.025
control over your agents

1956
00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:06.344
and therefore your context

1957
00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.264
window. There are two

1958
00:44:07.264 --> 00:44:08.922
flags in the Cloud

1959
00:44:08.922 --> 00:44:10.282
Code CLI and the

1960
00:44:10.282 --> 00:44:11.460
SDK. And I'll write

1961
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.561
the full prompt out

1962
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:13.179
here, right? So I

1963
00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:15.498
usually run CLDYS, right?

1964
00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:17.257
Cloud, dangerous, Let's go

1965
00:44:17.257 --> 00:44:18.378
ahead and just paste

1966
00:44:18.378 --> 00:44:19.257
this in here. Then

1967
00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:20.916
we'll run append system

1968
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:21.677
prompt. And then we'll

1969
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:23.436
pass in our specific

1970
00:44:23.516 --> 00:44:24.737
system prompt. When you

1971
00:44:24.737 --> 00:44:25.717
start modifying the system

1972
00:44:25.717 --> 00:44:26.956
prompt, you can't run

1973
00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:27.797
this in the loop,

1974
00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:28.655
okay? So you can't

1975
00:44:28.655 --> 00:44:29.655
open up an instance,

1976
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:30.315
at least not at
WEBVTT

1976
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:30.315
at least not at

1977
00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:31.155
the time of filming,

1978
00:44:31.195 --> 00:44:31.896
okay? You have to

1979
00:44:31.896 --> 00:44:33.436
run this in print

1980
00:44:33.456 --> 00:44:35.476
mode, in programmatic mode.

1981
00:44:35.534 --> 00:44:35.954
This is where we

1982
00:44:35.954 --> 00:44:37.335
start pushing out the

1983
00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:38.235
loop. So we do

1984
00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:39.155
need this dash dash

1985
00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:40.454
print or just dash

1986
00:44:40.454 --> 00:44:41.494
P flag. And then

1987
00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:42.554
we run a prompt.

1988
00:44:42.574 --> 00:44:44.153
So I'll say, what

1989
00:44:44.153 --> 00:44:47.686
is Claude.large.md for and

1990
00:44:47.686 --> 00:44:48.306
so that was the

1991
00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:49.606
large you know context

1992
00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:50.844
file that we demoed

1993
00:44:51.005 --> 00:44:52.045
in the beginning 18

1994
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:53.664
000 tokens massive then

1995
00:44:53.664 --> 00:44:54.244
i'm going to paste

1996
00:44:54.244 --> 00:44:55.644
in this system prompt

1997
00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:56.324
and so check this

1998
00:44:56.324 --> 00:44:58.063
out important when using

1999
00:44:58.063 --> 00:44:59.543
the read tool always

2000
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.543
read in increments of
WEBVTT

2000
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.543
read in increments of

2001
00:45:00.543 --> 00:45:02.704
100 lines for example

2002
00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:03.304
and then i give

2003
00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:04.623
an example being really

2004
00:45:04.623 --> 00:45:05.822
detailed with how to

2005
00:45:05.822 --> 00:45:07.503
call this tool exactly

2006
00:45:07.623 --> 00:45:08.103
and then if you

2007
00:45:08.103 --> 00:45:08.902
read enough to accomplish

2008
00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:10.023
the request a task

2009
00:45:10.023 --> 00:45:11.362
stop reading and proceed

2010
00:45:11.362 --> 00:45:12.061
with the task if

2011
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:12.922
you need more information

2012
00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:14.621
read another hundred lines

2013
00:45:14.722 --> 00:45:15.420
and determine if that's

2014
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.201
enough. And then we

2015
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:17.239
have one more instruction,

2016
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.759
important, we're tapping into

2017
00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:20.217
an information tense keyword.

2018
00:45:20.277 --> 00:45:21.518
When you respond to

2019
00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.097
the user with your

2020
00:45:22.097 --> 00:45:23.635
final message, always prefix

2021
00:45:23.675 --> 00:45:24.815
your last message with

2022
00:45:24.974 --> 00:45:26.353
check or X for

2023
00:45:26.353 --> 00:45:27.554
success or failure, all

2024
00:45:27.554 --> 00:45:28.813
right? And so this

2025
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.851
agent has been modified,
WEBVTT

2025
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.851
agent has been modified,

2026
00:45:30.891 --> 00:45:31.831
right? We have modified

2027
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:32.929
the system prompt, we

2028
00:45:32.929 --> 00:45:34.728
are controlling this agent

2029
00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:35.989
at a lower, more

2030
00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:37.668
foundational level. Okay. The

2031
00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.067
system prompt really lets

2032
00:45:39.067 --> 00:45:40.487
you start controlling how

2033
00:45:40.487 --> 00:45:41.646
your agent behaves and

2034
00:45:41.666 --> 00:45:42.346
when you control the

2035
00:45:42.346 --> 00:45:43.704
behavior, you control the

2036
00:45:43.704 --> 00:45:45.184
context window. So let's

2037
00:45:45.184 --> 00:45:45.704
make sure I end

2038
00:45:45.704 --> 00:45:46.483
the quote here and

2039
00:45:46.483 --> 00:45:47.643
let's fire this off.

2040
00:45:47.702 --> 00:45:48.302
You can see here,

2041
00:45:48.302 --> 00:45:49.143
we have a concise

2042
00:45:49.143 --> 00:45:51.041
response demonstrates what not

2043
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:52.641
to do with project

2044
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:55.039
documentation intentionally bloated using

2045
00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:56.938
anti-pattern of over contextualization,

2046
00:45:56.938 --> 00:45:58.137
cramming excessive details, blah,

2047
00:45:58.137 --> 00:45:59.177
blah, blah. Okay. So

2048
00:45:59.177 --> 00:46:00.496
it understood it ran.
WEBVTT

2048
00:45:59.177 --> 00:46:00.496
it understood it ran.

2049
00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:01.657
The interesting part here

2050
00:46:01.657 --> 00:46:02.896
is how it ran.

2051
00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:04.054
If we open up

2052
00:46:04.215 --> 00:46:06.152
our context bundle and

2053
00:46:06.152 --> 00:46:07.251
we go to this

2054
00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.728
context bundle that just

2055
00:46:08.728 --> 00:46:09.547
ran you can see

2056
00:46:09.547 --> 00:46:11.505
something really powerful Okay,

2057
00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:12.324
what is this file

2058
00:46:12.324 --> 00:46:12.844
for? You can see

2059
00:46:12.844 --> 00:46:13.605
our prompt and you

2060
00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.063
can see the subsequent

2061
00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:16.802
reads. Read 100, read

2062
00:46:16.802 --> 00:46:18.123
100. This agent is

2063
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:20.302
obeying the specific instructions

2064
00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:21.501
in our system prompt.

2065
00:46:21.501 --> 00:46:22.541
We're saying read 100

2066
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:23.320
lines at a time.

2067
00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:24.360
If you have enough

2068
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.739
information, stop executing and

2069
00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:28.237
respond, right? Proceed with

2070
00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:29.338
the task. This is

2071
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:30.976
super, super powerful. We've
WEBVTT

2071
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:30.976
super, super powerful. We've

2072
00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:32.576
just reduced the number

2073
00:46:32.576 --> 00:46:33.815
of lines our agent

2074
00:46:33.815 --> 00:46:34.855
had to read with

2075
00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:35.974
the read tool, okay?

2076
00:46:35.974 --> 00:46:37.233
And we forced Cloud

2077
00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:38.914
Code to increment. This

2078
00:46:38.914 --> 00:46:40.092
is super powerful. And

2079
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.112
this is just one

2080
00:46:41.112 --> 00:46:42.771
simple way, one simple

2081
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:45.248
control mechanism for steering

2082
00:46:45.268 --> 00:46:46.009
this agent in a

2083
00:46:46.009 --> 00:46:47.987
completely different direction. You

2084
00:46:47.987 --> 00:46:49.007
can push this even

2085
00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:50.746
further using the Cloud

2086
00:46:50.746 --> 00:46:52.405
Code SDK. In addition

2087
00:46:52.405 --> 00:46:53.764
to the append system

2088
00:46:53.764 --> 00:46:54.842
prompt command, there is

2089
00:46:54.842 --> 00:46:57.541
also a SDK specific

2090
00:46:57.641 --> 00:46:59.978
custom system prompt variable

2091
00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:00.458
that you can pass
WEBVTT

2091
00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:00.458
that you can pass

2092
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:01.938
into the SDK. Do

2093
00:47:01.938 --> 00:47:03.456
not use that unless

2094
00:47:03.456 --> 00:47:03.876
you know what you're

2095
00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:04.856
doing. The Claude Code

2096
00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:05.556
team has put a

2097
00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.594
ton of work into

2098
00:47:06.594 --> 00:47:08.253
crafting the system prompt

2099
00:47:08.514 --> 00:47:09.552
be a top tier

2100
00:47:09.552 --> 00:47:10.811
agent for engineering. If

2101
00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:12.192
you use, I think

2102
00:47:12.192 --> 00:47:13.550
it's called a custom

2103
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.869
system prompt, I'll of

2104
00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:15.668
course link all the

2105
00:47:15.668 --> 00:47:17.288
documentation below in your

2106
00:47:17.288 --> 00:47:18.307
loot box. But if

2107
00:47:18.307 --> 00:47:19.286
you use this variable,

2108
00:47:19.286 --> 00:47:20.806
you will blow away

2109
00:47:21.057 --> 00:47:22.237
the system prompt, use

2110
00:47:22.237 --> 00:47:23.637
this with caution. Okay.

2111
00:47:23.637 --> 00:47:24.456
And so we can

2112
00:47:24.456 --> 00:47:25.295
run another one. So

2113
00:47:25.295 --> 00:47:26.076
we have another prompt

2114
00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.275
here, same deal. We're

2115
00:47:27.275 --> 00:47:28.414
reading in chunks of

2116
00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:30.193
100. Figure out what
WEBVTT

2116
00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:30.193
100. Figure out what

2117
00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:31.172
Claude Code hooks are

2118
00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:32.713
available and their respective

2119
00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:34.371
input schemas from the

2120
00:47:34.371 --> 00:47:35.650
documentation. Okay. So I'm

2121
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.291
gonna fire this off.

2122
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.389
Here's that context bundle

2123
00:47:37.389 --> 00:47:38.130
running and you can

2124
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:38.929
see that same deal.

2125
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.289
There's all the response

2126
00:47:40.289 --> 00:47:41.907
formats for every hook

2127
00:47:41.987 --> 00:47:42.987
based on the existing

2128
00:47:42.987 --> 00:47:44.646
documentation and there's the

2129
00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:45.387
available hooks. But you

2130
00:47:45.387 --> 00:47:46.505
can see here again

2131
00:47:46.505 --> 00:47:47.365
in the context bundle,

2132
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:49.385
we're saving the actual

2133
00:47:49.385 --> 00:47:51.264
read executions and the

2134
00:47:51.264 --> 00:47:53.400
tool input. We've overwritten

2135
00:47:53.521 --> 00:47:55.557
the calling mechanism for

2136
00:47:55.577 --> 00:47:56.856
reading files. You can

2137
00:47:56.856 --> 00:47:57.875
see there that same

2138
00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:59.333
pattern, reading 100 at

2139
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:00.211
a time of the
WEBVTT

2139
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:00.211
a time of the

2140
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.630
Claude Code Hooks directory,

2141
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.190
For this one, it

2142
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.148
needed to read more

2143
00:48:03.148 --> 00:48:04.248
to accomplish this task,

2144
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:05.327
so it did. I

2145
00:48:05.327 --> 00:48:07.347
recommend you only use

2146
00:48:07.347 --> 00:48:08.586
this agentic level context

2147
00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:10.005
engineering technique when nothing

2148
00:48:10.005 --> 00:48:11.324
else works or when

2149
00:48:11.324 --> 00:48:12.065
you start building your

2150
00:48:12.105 --> 00:48:13.724
custom agents for your

2151
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.963
domain specific use cases

2152
00:48:14.963 --> 00:48:15.722
and when you start

2153
00:48:15.722 --> 00:48:17.302
deploying agents inside of

2154
00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.202
your codebase. Check

2155
00:48:18.202 --> 00:48:19.541
out the agentic horizon

2156
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.820
extended lesson on cloud

2157
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.960
code SDK mastery. There

2158
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.699
we break down the

2159
00:48:24.699 --> 00:48:26.237
Claude Code SDK so

2160
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:26.777
that you can run

2161
00:48:26.777 --> 00:48:27.438
this in a more

2162
00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:29.217
programmatic way so you

2163
00:48:29.217 --> 00:48:30.795
can build out specific
WEBVTT

2163
00:48:29.217 --> 00:48:30.795
can build out specific

2164
00:48:30.795 --> 00:48:32.574
agents inside of your

2165
00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:34.012
codebases. This is

2166
00:48:34.012 --> 00:48:35.311
where everything is going.

2167
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:37.188
Specific agents with specialized

2168
00:48:37.188 --> 00:48:39.027
context windows solving your

2169
00:48:39.146 --> 00:48:44.179
problems extraordinarily well. The

2170
00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:45.858
focus should always be

2171
00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:47.521
better agents or more

2172
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:48.760
agents? When you're adding

2173
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.159
more agents, you're pushing

2174
00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:51.079
into the D, the

2175
00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:52.659
delegation and the R

2176
00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:53.737
and D framework. You're

2177
00:48:53.737 --> 00:48:54.478
pushing it to the

2178
00:48:54.478 --> 00:48:55.856
max. You're using one

2179
00:48:55.856 --> 00:48:57.197
agent for one purpose.

2180
00:48:57.197 --> 00:48:57.956
And when something goes

2181
00:48:57.956 --> 00:48:59.016
wrong, you fix that

2182
00:48:59.016 --> 00:49:00.775
piece of your workflow.
WEBVTT

2182
00:48:59.016 --> 00:49:00.775
piece of your workflow.

2183
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:02.833
Now with primary multi-agent

2184
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.413
delegation, we're entering the

2185
00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:06.572
realm of multi-agent systems.

2186
00:49:06.612 --> 00:49:07.652
In TAC, with each

2187
00:49:07.652 --> 00:49:08.570
lesson, we built up

2188
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.550
variants of a multi-agent

2189
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.909
pipeline using this very

2190
00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:13.088
technique. And in lesson

2191
00:49:13.088 --> 00:49:14.469
eight, we showcase several

2192
00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:16.268
different multi-agent workflows and

2193
00:49:16.268 --> 00:49:17.907
systems and uis right

2194
00:49:18.007 --> 00:49:19.266
there are many ways

2195
00:49:19.266 --> 00:49:20.306
to delegate work at

2196
00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:20.827
a high level but

2197
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:21.527
when you get down

2198
00:49:21.527 --> 00:49:21.987
to it if you

2199
00:49:21.987 --> 00:49:23.027
want to create an

2200
00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:25.266
on-the-fly primary agent you

2201
00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:26.367
have two options you

2202
00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:27.505
have the cli and

2203
00:49:27.505 --> 00:49:28.846
you have sdks at

2204
00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:29.626
the mid and high

2205
00:49:29.626 --> 00:49:30.985
level we can kick
WEBVTT

2205
00:49:29.626 --> 00:49:30.985
level we can kick

2206
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:32.605
off primary agents through

2207
00:49:32.605 --> 00:49:35.023
prompts, through wrapper CLIs,

2208
00:49:35.103 --> 00:49:36.742
through MCP servers, and

2209
00:49:36.742 --> 00:49:38.360
through UIs. You've likely

2210
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.221
seen a lot of

2211
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.739
Claude Code management systems

2212
00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:42.298
and a lot of

2213
00:49:42.338 --> 00:49:43.838
agent systems get built

2214
00:49:43.838 --> 00:49:44.856
up into their own

2215
00:49:44.936 --> 00:49:46.856
UIs. That is primary

2216
00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:49.134
agent delegation. Now, what's

2217
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:51.164
the most lightweight version

2218
00:49:51.164 --> 00:49:52.563
of multi-agent delegation. You

2219
00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:54.222
can use ASAP and

2220
00:49:54.222 --> 00:49:55.181
get value out of

2221
00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.820
ASAP. It's a simple

2222
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.577
reusable custom slash command.

2223
00:49:58.577 --> 00:49:59.836
If you remember inside

2224
00:49:59.836 --> 00:50:01.175
of the cloud directory
WEBVTT

2224
00:49:59.836 --> 00:50:01.175
of the cloud directory

2225
00:50:01.175 --> 00:50:02.795
in our commands directory,

2226
00:50:02.795 --> 00:50:05.605
we have background.md. This

2227
00:50:05.605 --> 00:50:07.744
is a simple single

2228
00:50:07.744 --> 00:50:09.083
prompt that boots up

2229
00:50:09.143 --> 00:50:10.943
a background Claude Code

2230
00:50:10.943 --> 00:50:12.143
instance. This is the

2231
00:50:12.143 --> 00:50:14.121
simplest, quickest way, other

2232
00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:14.842
than going right through

2233
00:50:14.842 --> 00:50:16.521
the CLI, to delegate

2234
00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:18.260
work to agents. When

2235
00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.079
you use a pattern

2236
00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:20.539
like this, we're pushing

2237
00:50:20.539 --> 00:50:21.978
in to powerful Outloop

2238
00:50:21.978 --> 00:50:23.518
agent decoding by running

2239
00:50:23.518 --> 00:50:24.737
a single prompt with

2240
00:50:24.737 --> 00:50:25.876
a single agent that

2241
00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:27.556
does one thing, reports

2242
00:50:27.556 --> 00:50:28.715
its work, and then

2243
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.034
it finishes. So let
WEBVTT

2243
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.034
it finishes. So let

2244
00:50:30.034 --> 00:50:30.574
me show you exactly

2245
00:50:30.574 --> 00:50:31.135
what I mean. I'll

2246
00:50:31.135 --> 00:50:32.833
run Claude Opus in

2247
00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:33.713
Yolo mode here, and

2248
00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:34.773
then I'll say slash

2249
00:50:34.833 --> 00:50:35.813
background. And you can

2250
00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:36.672
see here, this fires

2251
00:50:36.672 --> 00:50:37.891
off a full Claude

2252
00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:39.070
code instance in the

2253
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.490
background. Here's our argument

2254
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.269
hint, prompt model report

2255
00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.248
file. I wanna kick

2256
00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:44.068
off the creation of

2257
00:50:44.068 --> 00:50:45.208
a plan. There's no

2258
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:46.327
reason for me to

2259
00:50:46.507 --> 00:50:47.487
sit here in the

2260
00:50:47.487 --> 00:50:48.547
loop prompting back and

2261
00:50:48.547 --> 00:50:49.505
forth when I can

2262
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.606
kick off a background

2263
00:50:50.606 --> 00:50:51.264
agent, when I can

2264
00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:52.965
delegate this work outside

2265
00:50:52.965 --> 00:50:54.184
of my primary agent's

2266
00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.563
content context window, right?

2267
00:50:55.563 --> 00:50:56.623
We're delegating this work

2268
00:50:56.643 --> 00:50:57.961
out. I can open

2269
00:50:57.961 --> 00:50:58.920
up some quotes here,

2270
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.159
paste this in, and
WEBVTT

2270
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.159
paste this in, and

2271
00:51:00.159 --> 00:51:00.679
this is going to

2272
00:51:00.679 --> 00:51:01.938
kick off a new

2273
00:51:02.239 --> 00:51:03.038
quick plan. So we're

2274
00:51:03.038 --> 00:51:04.916
running that plan workflow,

2275
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.235
that plan agentic prompt

2276
00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:07.215
again. This time we're

2277
00:51:07.215 --> 00:51:08.155
building out a cloud

2278
00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:09.094
code. These are just

2279
00:51:09.094 --> 00:51:10.652
random code examples. We're

2280
00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:11.253
going to read a

2281
00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:11.773
couple of pieces of

2282
00:51:11.773 --> 00:51:13.132
documentation and this time

2283
00:51:13.132 --> 00:51:14.411
we're building out a

2284
00:51:14.411 --> 00:51:16.382
astral UV Claude Code,

2285
00:51:16.382 --> 00:51:17.621
Python SDK with that

2286
00:51:17.621 --> 00:51:19.000
same format, right? Those

2287
00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:20.219
three files by Dantic

2288
00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:21.557
types, low level files,

2289
00:51:21.557 --> 00:51:23.295
CLI file, right? Specifying

2290
00:51:23.295 --> 00:51:23.996
where to create it.

2291
00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:24.934
This is the plan.

2292
00:51:25.434 --> 00:51:26.193
Let's fire it off.

2293
00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:26.813
This is going to

2294
00:51:26.813 --> 00:51:28.393
kick off a background

2295
00:51:28.432 --> 00:51:30.190
agent. Okay. And so
WEBVTT

2295
00:51:28.432 --> 00:51:30.190
agent. Okay. And so

2296
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.690
you can see our

2297
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.650
primary agent getting to

2298
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.708
work here based on

2299
00:51:32.708 --> 00:51:33.869
the contents of this

2300
00:51:33.869 --> 00:51:34.788
prompt. We can of

2301
00:51:34.788 --> 00:51:36.027
course see that, you

2302
00:51:36.027 --> 00:51:38.025
know, consistent prompt format

2303
00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:39.583
where you're reusing great

2304
00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:40.684
prompt structures that get

2305
00:51:40.684 --> 00:51:41.603
work done for us.

2306
00:51:41.603 --> 00:51:43.141
Again, check out, the

2307
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.340
agentic prompt engineering, agentic

2308
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.239
horizon extended lesson to

2309
00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:47.838
learn how to write

2310
00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.077
great prompts for the

2311
00:51:49.077 --> 00:51:50.297
age of agents. And

2312
00:51:50.297 --> 00:51:51.157
it's all inside of

2313
00:51:51.157 --> 00:51:52.416
the workflow step here,

2314
00:51:52.456 --> 00:51:53.536
right? So create the

2315
00:51:53.536 --> 00:51:54.914
agents background directory. We

2316
00:51:54.914 --> 00:51:56.253
have our default values.

2317
00:51:56.385 --> 00:51:56.885
And then this is

2318
00:51:56.885 --> 00:51:58.364
important, we're creating a

2319
00:51:58.364 --> 00:52:00.143
report file, okay? And
WEBVTT

2319
00:51:58.364 --> 00:52:00.143
report file, okay? And

2320
00:52:00.143 --> 00:52:00.603
then we have this

2321
00:52:00.603 --> 00:52:02.762
primary agent delegation, XML

2322
00:52:02.762 --> 00:52:04.581
wrapper, where we're detailing

2323
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:05.501
a bunch of information

2324
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:06.380
for our agent, okay?

2325
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:07.541
We are kicking off

2326
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:09.000
a Claude Code instance

2327
00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:10.079
from Claude Code. We

2328
00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:12.059
have compute orchestrating compute,

2329
00:52:12.278 --> 00:52:14.536
agents orchestrating agents, okay?

2330
00:52:14.717 --> 00:52:15.996
This is where everything

2331
00:52:15.996 --> 00:52:17.635
is headed. Better agents

2332
00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:18.914
and then more agents.

2333
00:52:18.914 --> 00:52:19.755
Once you master a

2334
00:52:19.755 --> 00:52:20.934
single context window, you

2335
00:52:20.934 --> 00:52:22.034
can scale it up.

2336
00:52:22.094 --> 00:52:23.132
There's a format here,

2337
00:52:23.132 --> 00:52:23.813
blah, blah, blah, skip

2338
00:52:23.813 --> 00:52:24.413
to the bottom. But

2339
00:52:24.413 --> 00:52:25.273
the important thing here

2340
00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:26.351
is that this free

2341
00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.510
up the primary cloud

2342
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:28.311
code instance. You can

2343
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:28.610
see we have a

2344
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.168
background task, background cloud
WEBVTT

2344
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.168
background task, background cloud

2345
00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:31.048
code kicked off. If

2346
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:31.907
we open this up,

2347
00:52:32.027 --> 00:52:32.987
this is the file

2348
00:52:32.987 --> 00:52:33.766
that our agent is

2349
00:52:33.766 --> 00:52:35.025
going to be reporting

2350
00:52:35.025 --> 00:52:35.945
to. And so cool

2351
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:37.063
thing here, we can

2352
00:52:37.063 --> 00:52:38.264
open up a context

2353
00:52:38.264 --> 00:52:39.402
bundle for this agent,

2354
00:52:39.402 --> 00:52:39.942
right? So if we

2355
00:52:39.942 --> 00:52:40.541
hit up here, you

2356
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:41.860
can see that exact

2357
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.000
prompt background slash quick

2358
00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:45.318
plan, read, blah, blah,

2359
00:52:45.318 --> 00:52:46.157
blah, blah, blah. This

2360
00:52:46.157 --> 00:52:47.257
agent is starting to

2361
00:52:47.257 --> 00:52:48.237
work, all right? It's

2362
00:52:48.257 --> 00:52:49.096
starting to create this

2363
00:52:49.096 --> 00:52:49.795
plan. And we can

2364
00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:50.835
see that with the

2365
00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:52.226
context bundle. You can

2366
00:52:52.226 --> 00:52:53.045
see this is super

2367
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.844
useful adding logging, having

2368
00:52:54.844 --> 00:52:56.684
these trails, there's the

2369
00:52:56.684 --> 00:52:57.784
actual plan just got

2370
00:52:57.784 --> 00:52:59.364
written there. Having this

2371
00:52:59.364 --> 00:53:01.003
trail, this story of
WEBVTT

2371
00:52:59.364 --> 00:53:01.003
trail, this story of

2372
00:53:01.003 --> 00:53:01.664
what your agents have

2373
00:53:01.664 --> 00:53:02.844
done is an important

2374
00:53:02.963 --> 00:53:04.463
agentic pattern. We are

2375
00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:05.902
building up on every

2376
00:53:05.902 --> 00:53:07.802
context engineering technique we've

2377
00:53:07.802 --> 00:53:09.103
used thus far. This

2378
00:53:09.103 --> 00:53:10.742
agent should report back

2379
00:53:10.742 --> 00:53:11.722
to its report file

2380
00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:12.222
here. This is a

2381
00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.342
great way to track

2382
00:53:13.474 --> 00:53:14.612
the progress of your

2383
00:53:14.612 --> 00:53:15.532
agents as they work

2384
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.789
in the background. So

2385
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:17.269
you can see here,

2386
00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:17.668
we still have that

2387
00:53:17.668 --> 00:53:19.128
one background task running.

2388
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.005
We should get an

2389
00:53:20.025 --> 00:53:21.744
update here. Our agent

2390
00:53:21.744 --> 00:53:22.882
has, there we go.

2391
00:53:22.882 --> 00:53:23.302
So you can see

2392
00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:24.481
it's reading its background

2393
00:53:24.481 --> 00:53:25.860
file now. And then

2394
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.599
soon it's gonna put

2395
00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:27.418
the right in here.

2396
00:53:27.418 --> 00:53:27.936
We should see this

2397
00:53:27.936 --> 00:53:29.715
come in live as

2398
00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.014
our background. delegated agent
WEBVTT

2398
00:53:29.715 --> 00:53:32.014
our background. delegated agent

2399
00:53:32.014 --> 00:53:33.393
instance is just writing

2400
00:53:33.393 --> 00:53:34.072
this plan for us.

2401
00:53:34.072 --> 00:53:35.012
There's no reason for

2402
00:53:35.012 --> 00:53:35.472
me to sit in

2403
00:53:35.472 --> 00:53:35.992
the loop. I know

2404
00:53:35.992 --> 00:53:37.371
exactly what this does.

2405
00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:38.630
And here is the

2406
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:39.811
output. Check this out,

2407
00:53:39.811 --> 00:53:41.989
progress task completed. It

2408
00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:43.789
renamed this file. I

2409
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:44.949
have an instruction to

2410
00:53:44.949 --> 00:53:46.168
rename the file when

2411
00:53:46.168 --> 00:53:49.027
it finishes, 1302.53. We

2412
00:53:49.027 --> 00:53:50.068
can click this. It

2413
00:53:50.068 --> 00:53:51.447
is now complete. A

2414
00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:53.286
very quick one prompt

2415
00:53:53.405 --> 00:53:55.137
agent delegation system It's

2416
00:53:55.157 --> 00:53:56.257
all here for you

2417
00:53:56.257 --> 00:53:57.177
in this codebase.

2418
00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:58.056
Think of these as

2419
00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.016
starting points for understanding
WEBVTT

2419
00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.016
starting points for understanding

2420
00:54:00.016 --> 00:54:01.094
what you can do

2421
00:54:01.094 --> 00:54:03.393
to better manage the

2422
00:54:03.393 --> 00:54:04.773
context of your agents.

2423
00:54:04.813 --> 00:54:05.492
It's all about the

2424
00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:07.112
patterns. It's all about

2425
00:54:07.132 --> 00:54:08.492
taking control of your

2426
00:54:08.492 --> 00:54:10.271
agents context windows and

2427
00:54:10.271 --> 00:54:11.489
scaling it to the

2428
00:54:11.489 --> 00:54:12.710
moon. The more compute

2429
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:13.509
you can control, the

2430
00:54:13.509 --> 00:54:14.668
more compute you can

2431
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.007
orchestrate, right? The more

2432
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.827
agents you can orchestrate,

2433
00:54:17.827 --> 00:54:19.505
the more intelligence that

2434
00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:20.525
you can orchestrate, the

2435
00:54:20.525 --> 00:54:21.784
more you will be

2436
00:54:21.784 --> 00:54:22.664
able to do the

2437
00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:23.585
limits on what an

2438
00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:24.864
engineer can do right

2439
00:54:24.864 --> 00:54:27.382
now is absolutely unknown.

2440
00:54:27.583 --> 00:54:29.302
Anyone being pessimistic, ignore

2441
00:54:29.322 --> 00:54:31.442
them. Don't take my
WEBVTT

2441
00:54:29.322 --> 00:54:31.442
them. Don't take my

2442
00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:33.021
word for this. Ignore

2443
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:33.922
me as well, but

2444
00:54:34.001 --> 00:54:36.141
investigate the optimist in

2445
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:36.940
the space. See what

2446
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.641
they can really do.

2447
00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.239
See what we're really

2448
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:40.920
doing here. We have

2449
00:54:41.079 --> 00:54:43.438
background, compute, agents calling

2450
00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:44.318
agents. We have the

2451
00:54:44.458 --> 00:54:47.038
R&D framework, 12 context

2452
00:54:47.038 --> 00:54:48.217
engineering techniques. These are

2453
00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.556
concrete things. Maybe a

2454
00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:50.396
couple of these techniques

2455
00:54:50.396 --> 00:54:51.056
fly over your head

2456
00:54:51.056 --> 00:54:52.157
or you're not interested

2457
00:54:52.157 --> 00:54:52.516
or you think it

2458
00:54:52.516 --> 00:54:53.135
doesn't apply to you.

2459
00:54:53.135 --> 00:54:54.655
That's fine. Just take

2460
00:54:54.655 --> 00:54:55.295
one. a couple of

2461
00:54:55.295 --> 00:54:56.695
these and improve your

2462
00:54:56.695 --> 00:54:59.253
context engineering. The background

2463
00:54:59.293 --> 00:55:01.233
agent task and multi-agent
WEBVTT

2463
00:54:59.293 --> 00:55:01.233
agent task and multi-agent

2464
00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:03.211
delegation is super important

2465
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:04.192
because it gets you

2466
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:05.911
out the loop. This

2467
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:06.851
is a big idea

2468
00:55:06.851 --> 00:55:08.269
we discuss in TAC

2469
00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:09.688
and it extends into

2470
00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:11.507
context engineering. Get out

2471
00:55:11.507 --> 00:55:12.467
the loop, set up

2472
00:55:12.467 --> 00:55:14.686
many focused agents that

2473
00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:16.565
do one thing extraordinarily

2474
00:55:16.565 --> 00:55:18.188
well. In a lot

2475
00:55:18.188 --> 00:55:20.284
of ways, multi-agent delegation

2476
00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:21.922
is just like sub-agents,

2477
00:55:21.922 --> 00:55:23.041
but we get complete

2478
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.797
control. We're firing off

2479
00:55:24.898 --> 00:55:27.552
top-level primary agents from

2480
00:55:27.552 --> 00:55:29.110
our in-loop primary agent

2481
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.469
here. Okay, so there's
WEBVTT

2481
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.469
here. Okay, so there's

2482
00:55:30.469 --> 00:55:31.588
a lot more control

2483
00:55:31.588 --> 00:55:33.967
here. This background agent

2484
00:55:34.088 --> 00:55:35.387
and the prompt that

2485
00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:36.126
I passed in, right?

2486
00:55:36.126 --> 00:55:36.746
We can just paste

2487
00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:37.686
this prompt. I could

2488
00:55:37.686 --> 00:55:39.264
have asked for anything

2489
00:55:39.264 --> 00:55:40.585
here, right? This doesn't

2490
00:55:40.585 --> 00:55:40.885
need to be a

2491
00:55:40.905 --> 00:55:41.983
quick plan. I could

2492
00:55:41.983 --> 00:55:43.842
have asked for a

2493
00:55:43.842 --> 00:55:46.722
multi-agent workflow running sub-agents,

2494
00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:48.021
right? There's just so

2495
00:55:48.021 --> 00:55:49.800
many ways to build

2496
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.940
and to use multi-agent

2497
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.219
systems. The key idea

2498
00:55:52.219 --> 00:55:53.358
here is, let's bring

2499
00:55:53.358 --> 00:55:54.039
it all back to

2500
00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:55.418
context engineering. The key

2501
00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.657
idea here is you

2502
00:55:56.657 --> 00:55:58.996
can delegate specialized work

2503
00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:00.655
and focus agents by
WEBVTT

2503
00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:00.655
and focus agents by

2504
00:56:00.655 --> 00:56:02.536
building out some type

2505
00:56:02.695 --> 00:56:04.295
of primary agent delegation

2506
00:56:04.295 --> 00:56:05.115
workflow you can see

2507
00:56:05.115 --> 00:56:07.114
here in just one

2508
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.574
prompt we have a

2509
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:10.635
full Claude Code instance

2510
00:56:10.655 --> 00:56:12.094
in the background doing

2511
00:56:12.094 --> 00:56:12.894
work for us that

2512
00:56:12.894 --> 00:56:14.275
we know we don't

2513
00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:15.695
need to monitor anymore

2514
00:56:15.775 --> 00:56:16.815
and the more you

2515
00:56:16.815 --> 00:56:17.954
become comfortable and the

2516
00:56:17.954 --> 00:56:19.755
more your agentic engineering

2517
00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:21.253
skill improves the more

2518
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.954
you can stop babysitting

2519
00:56:23.014 --> 00:56:24.753
every single agent instance

2520
00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:25.514
okay this is a

2521
00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:26.114
big theme in tech

2522
00:56:26.114 --> 00:56:27.313
we want to scale

2523
00:56:27.353 --> 00:56:28.610
from in loop to

2524
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.849
Outloop to ZTE. Speaking
WEBVTT

2524
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.849
Outloop to ZTE. Speaking

2525
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:32.327
of specialization, speaking of

2526
00:56:32.527 --> 00:56:33.447
all these big ideas,

2527
00:56:33.447 --> 00:56:34.706
let's wrap up with

2528
00:56:34.786 --> 00:56:35.646
potentially one of the

2529
00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:37.945
most powerful context engineering

2530
00:56:37.945 --> 00:56:39.425
techniques. Let's talk about

2531
00:56:39.465 --> 00:56:44.663
agent experts. So what

2532
00:56:44.663 --> 00:56:45.402
does this all build

2533
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:46.621
up to? We've already,

2534
00:56:46.965 --> 00:56:48.344
covered the main idea,

2535
00:56:48.465 --> 00:56:49.925
right? Build focused agents,

2536
00:56:49.985 --> 00:56:51.623
deploy them in ADWs

2537
00:56:51.643 --> 00:56:53.802
with specialized pipelines, protect

2538
00:56:53.822 --> 00:56:54.882
your context window at

2539
00:56:54.882 --> 00:56:56.001
all costs inside of

2540
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:57.521
every agent. But once

2541
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:57.960
you put all this

2542
00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.719
together, you can get

2543
00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:00.179
something really special, something
WEBVTT

2543
00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:00.179
something really special, something

2544
00:57:00.179 --> 00:57:01.378
really powerful. There's not

2545
00:57:01.378 --> 00:57:01.998
really a name for

2546
00:57:01.998 --> 00:57:02.699
this yet, but I've

2547
00:57:02.699 --> 00:57:03.858
been just blatantly calling

2548
00:57:03.858 --> 00:57:06.117
this pattern agent experts.

2549
00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:07.356
The idea is simple

2550
00:57:07.356 --> 00:57:08.936
and powerful, especially for

2551
00:57:08.936 --> 00:57:10.954
context engineering with agents

2552
00:57:10.974 --> 00:57:12.673
on large codebases.

2553
00:57:12.673 --> 00:57:13.592
Okay, this idea is

2554
00:57:13.612 --> 00:57:14.932
echoed inside of TAC

2555
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:16.391
with templates. You can

2556
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:18.311
use your agent delegation

2557
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:19.369
of choice. You can

2558
00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:20.228
use your primary agent,

2559
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:21.887
primary delegated agent, or

2560
00:57:21.887 --> 00:57:23.047
sub-agent. And the whole

2561
00:57:23.047 --> 00:57:23.606
idea is that you

2562
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.864
fire off specialized agents

2563
00:57:25.864 --> 00:57:27.623
that are experts at

2564
00:57:27.623 --> 00:57:29.300
specific parts of your

2565
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.380
codebase. And here's
WEBVTT

2565
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.380
codebase. And here's

2566
00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.480
the kicker, you have

2567
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.018
them auto update their

2568
00:57:33.018 --> 00:57:34.577
own knowledge. This is

2569
00:57:34.577 --> 00:57:36.574
the agent experts technique.

2570
00:57:36.695 --> 00:57:37.054
Let me show you

2571
00:57:37.054 --> 00:57:38.434
exactly how. Inside of

2572
00:57:38.434 --> 00:57:40.353
our Claude commands directory

2573
00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:41.411
here, we have an

2574
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:43.192
experts directory. Right now

2575
00:57:43.192 --> 00:57:44.170
we have a single

2576
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:45.070
expert in this code

2577
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:45.989
base and you can

2578
00:57:45.989 --> 00:57:47.269
see this agent expert

2579
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:48.789
is focused on Claude

2580
00:57:48.889 --> 00:57:50.568
code hooks. Now, before

2581
00:57:50.568 --> 00:57:51.608
we move forward, let

2582
00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:52.487
me just kick off

2583
00:57:52.567 --> 00:57:53.706
this expert. So I'm

2584
00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:54.686
gonna run this prompt

2585
00:57:54.686 --> 00:57:55.266
and I'll just paste

2586
00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:56.186
this in for brevity.

2587
00:57:56.304 --> 00:57:58.324
I'll type slash experts.

2588
00:57:58.364 --> 00:57:58.824
And so now we

2589
00:57:58.824 --> 00:57:59.463
can just see all

2590
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:00.463
of our experts and
WEBVTT

2590
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:00.463
of our experts and

2591
00:58:00.463 --> 00:58:01.802
I want our planning

2592
00:58:02.003 --> 00:58:03.402
Claude code hook expert.

2593
00:58:03.402 --> 00:58:04.121
And now we'll paste

2594
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:04.840
in a prompt. Okay,

2595
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.360
so I'm gonna paste

2596
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.061
this in. This is

2597
00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:06.860
a simple high to

2598
00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.780
mid-level prompt, We want

2599
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.980
our expert to take

2600
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.840
the wheel on this,

2601
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.780
all right? So what

2602
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.699
does this do? Long

2603
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:14.579
story short here is,

2604
00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:15.059
you can pause the

2605
00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:15.539
video and read it

2606
00:58:15.539 --> 00:58:16.219
if you want. We're

2607
00:58:16.219 --> 00:58:17.619
gonna create a output

2608
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:18.458
structure. So we have

2609
00:58:18.539 --> 00:58:20.378
agents, hook logs for

2610
00:58:20.378 --> 00:58:21.858
every Claude Code instance.

2611
00:58:21.938 --> 00:58:23.219
We want a full

2612
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:25.278
log of every event

2613
00:58:25.338 --> 00:58:26.059
so we can improve

2614
00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:27.059
our agentic coding, right?

2615
00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:28.358
We want additional monitoring.

2616
00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:28.739
So how are we

2617
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:29.458
gonna do that? We're

2618
00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.797
gonna have our Cloud
WEBVTT

2618
00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.797
gonna have our Cloud

2619
00:58:30.797 --> 00:58:32.577
Code hook expert build

2620
00:58:32.597 --> 00:58:34.378
this directory structure. Agents,

2621
00:58:34.458 --> 00:58:36.358
hook logs, session ID,

2622
00:58:36.557 --> 00:58:38.077
name of hook, okay?

2623
00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:39.050
Let's fire this off

2624
00:58:39.168 --> 00:58:41.108
and let's understand what

2625
00:58:41.108 --> 00:58:42.447
our expert can do.

2626
00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:43.847
All right, so let's

2627
00:58:43.847 --> 00:58:44.666
open up this prompt.

2628
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:45.605
We want the Cloud

2629
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:47.443
Code Hook Expert plan.

2630
00:58:47.603 --> 00:58:48.143
This is gonna look

2631
00:58:48.284 --> 00:58:49.742
very similar with an

2632
00:58:49.742 --> 00:58:50.961
additional section that you

2633
00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:52.240
probably haven't seen before.

2634
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.521
We have an expertise

2635
00:58:53.521 --> 00:58:55.278
section. Now, this section

2636
00:58:55.478 --> 00:58:56.239
on its own, it's

2637
00:58:56.239 --> 00:58:56.878
not that useful. It's

2638
00:58:56.878 --> 00:58:57.998
not that different really

2639
00:58:58.077 --> 00:58:59.717
than our instructions or

2640
00:58:59.717 --> 00:59:00.795
our workflow. But the
WEBVTT

2640
00:58:59.717 --> 00:59:00.795
our workflow. But the

2641
00:59:00.795 --> 00:59:02.034
key here is we

2642
00:59:02.034 --> 00:59:04.333
have a three-step agent

2643
00:59:04.414 --> 00:59:05.634
expert. Let's open this

2644
00:59:05.634 --> 00:59:06.434
file explorer up again

2645
00:59:06.434 --> 00:59:06.893
and you can see

2646
00:59:06.893 --> 00:59:07.753
here we have plan,

2647
00:59:07.853 --> 00:59:09.353
build, improve and it

2648
00:59:09.353 --> 00:59:11.152
runs in that flow.

2649
00:59:11.413 --> 00:59:12.472
Okay, so this agent

2650
00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:13.492
right now is planning

2651
00:59:13.492 --> 00:59:14.411
for us. It's a

2652
00:59:14.652 --> 00:59:16.831
specialized Claude Code hook

2653
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:18.291
planner agent. So it's

2654
00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:20.210
built just for planning

2655
00:59:20.331 --> 00:59:21.650
Claude Code hook related

2656
00:59:21.751 --> 00:59:23.150
functionality. We'll then pass

2657
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.050
it off to our

2658
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.090
expert builder, which is

2659
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.048
gonna take the path

2660
00:59:27.048 --> 00:59:28.148
to the spec that

2661
00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:29.389
our planner created, and

2662
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:30.168
the agent that runs
WEBVTT

2662
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:30.168
the agent that runs

2663
00:59:30.168 --> 00:59:30.947
this prompt, as you

2664
00:59:30.947 --> 00:59:31.947
can imagine, is gonna

2665
00:59:31.947 --> 00:59:33.987
be specialized to running

2666
00:59:34.146 --> 00:59:35.626
Claude Code hooks, right?

2667
00:59:35.626 --> 00:59:36.385
You can even see

2668
00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:37.905
directory structure all the

2669
00:59:37.905 --> 00:59:39.726
relevant files to this

2670
00:59:39.744 --> 00:59:41.445
specific piece of our

2671
00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:42.704
codebase right you

2672
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:43.644
can see here we're

2673
00:59:43.644 --> 00:59:45.565
building experts we're not

2674
00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:48.003
building random one-off agents

2675
00:59:48.003 --> 00:59:49.844
random agent instances we've

2676
00:59:49.844 --> 00:59:51.103
built a reasonable prompt

2677
00:59:51.103 --> 00:59:52.503
that mounts and you

2678
00:59:52.503 --> 00:59:53.543
know to echo all

2679
00:59:53.543 --> 00:59:53.983
the way back to

2680
00:59:53.983 --> 00:59:55.523
our beginner techniques we

2681
00:59:55.523 --> 00:59:56.123
are in a way

2682
00:59:56.123 --> 00:59:57.742
priming this agent to

2683
00:59:57.742 --> 00:59:59.043
be an expert at

2684
00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.922
this area of focus
WEBVTT

2684
00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.922
this area of focus

2685
01:00:00.922 --> 01:00:01.902
okay a lot of

2686
01:00:01.942 --> 01:00:02.461
the work i do

2687
01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:03.532
is aimed at showing

2688
01:00:03.532 --> 01:00:04.512
you the vision and

2689
01:00:04.512 --> 01:00:05.293
giving you the new

2690
01:00:05.293 --> 01:00:06.692
beliefs and the new

2691
01:00:06.692 --> 01:00:08.931
ideas, the new context

2692
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:10.110
that you need to

2693
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.648
deploy agents, to deploy

2694
01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:13.608
generative AI in new

2695
01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.567
forward leaning ways. Okay,

2696
01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:16.106
so this is just

2697
01:00:16.106 --> 01:00:17.045
one idea, but you

2698
01:00:17.045 --> 01:00:18.925
can imagine multiple experts

2699
01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.583
across your codebase

2700
01:00:20.623 --> 01:00:22.043
that are extraordinary. They're

2701
01:00:22.043 --> 01:00:22.802
like the engineer on

2702
01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:23.902
your team that knows

2703
01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:24.981
that one piece of

2704
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:26.701
code, that one feature

2705
01:00:26.701 --> 01:00:28.139
better than anyone. Now

2706
01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:29.179
you can encode this,

2707
01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:30.358
you can template it
WEBVTT

2707
01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:30.358
you can template it

2708
01:00:30.358 --> 01:00:32.909
into an expert, agent

2709
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:34.188
expert and here's the

2710
01:00:34.188 --> 01:00:35.467
cherry on top after

2711
01:00:35.467 --> 01:00:36.648
you implement the plan

2712
01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:37.588
after you have your

2713
01:00:37.588 --> 01:00:38.806
expert build it right

2714
01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:40.385
specialize at building this

2715
01:00:40.405 --> 01:00:41.945
specific type of work

2716
01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:43.704
you can run your

2717
01:00:43.704 --> 01:00:46.402
meta improvement expert okay

2718
01:00:46.623 --> 01:00:47.202
you're a Claude Code

2719
01:00:47.202 --> 01:00:48.621
hook expert specialize in

2720
01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:50.661
continuous improvement you'll analyze

2721
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:51.780
the work done blah

2722
01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.059
blah blah and update

2723
01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.458
your plan and build

2724
01:00:54.639 --> 01:00:55.918
experts so we have

2725
01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:58.333
a prompt built improve

2726
01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:00.652
our prompts. Okay, we're
WEBVTT

2726
01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:00.652
our prompts. Okay, we're

2727
01:01:00.652 --> 01:01:01.452
very close to the

2728
01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:02.952
edge here. And you

2729
01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:03.590
can see where this

2730
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:04.550
goes for you, right?

2731
01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:06.730
It's auto documenting itself

2732
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.068
improving. Let's go ahead

2733
01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:08.949
and continue this workflow.

2734
01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:09.369
You can see here

2735
01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:10.847
our spec got created,

2736
01:01:10.987 --> 01:01:11.367
you know, we have

2737
01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.286
a great spec here

2738
01:01:12.286 --> 01:01:13.666
detailing exactly how this

2739
01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:14.485
works. Feel free to

2740
01:01:14.485 --> 01:01:15.385
pause at any point.

2741
01:01:15.445 --> 01:01:16.385
And I'll go ahead

2742
01:01:16.385 --> 01:01:17.264
and just commit this

2743
01:01:17.264 --> 01:01:18.583
work with the elite

2744
01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:20.163
context engineering codebase

2745
01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:21.023
so that this feature

2746
01:01:21.023 --> 01:01:21.822
will be built out

2747
01:01:21.822 --> 01:01:23.121
will be logging this

2748
01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:24.282
structure by the time

2749
01:01:24.302 --> 01:01:24.840
you get your hands

2750
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.340
on this. All right,

2751
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:25.960
I'm going to copy

2752
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.880
the reference to this,

2753
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.599
I'm going to a

2754
01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:28.719
Of course, I'm not

2755
01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:29.958
gonna use this existing

2756
01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:30.818
context window if we
WEBVTT

2756
01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:30.818
context window if we

2757
01:01:30.818 --> 01:01:32.358
type slash context. Already

2758
01:01:32.358 --> 01:01:34.476
spent 26K, even though

2759
01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:35.396
we could chain on

2760
01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:36.215
top of this agent,

2761
01:01:36.414 --> 01:01:37.454
we are not. We

2762
01:01:37.454 --> 01:01:39.193
are practicing, we're preparing

2763
01:01:39.193 --> 01:01:40.773
for Outloop agents. We're

2764
01:01:40.813 --> 01:01:41.972
thinking about this as

2765
01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:42.871
if we're building a

2766
01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:44.110
pipeline of agents. I'm

2767
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:44.851
gonna open a new

2768
01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:46.949
instance here, Claude, Yolo

2769
01:01:46.949 --> 01:01:48.509
mode, Opus, and then

2770
01:01:48.509 --> 01:01:49.668
I'm gonna type slash

2771
01:01:49.728 --> 01:01:50.967
expert. We're going to

2772
01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:52.867
build this feature and

2773
01:01:52.867 --> 01:01:53.646
then we're gonna paste

2774
01:01:53.646 --> 01:01:55.277
in the path and

2775
01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:57.137
let this fresh focused

2776
01:01:57.137 --> 01:01:58.994
agent cook, okay? We

2777
01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:00.434
have one agent planning,
WEBVTT

2777
01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:00.434
have one agent planning,

2778
01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:01.393
we have the other

2779
01:02:01.474 --> 01:02:02.552
building, and we have

2780
01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.831
the last self improving.

2781
01:02:04.831 --> 01:02:06.389
Whatever changes we make

2782
01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.688
to this system, our

2783
01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:09.788
improve expert, our sub

2784
01:02:09.847 --> 01:02:10.987
prompt, our sub agent

2785
01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:12.425
inside of this three

2786
01:02:12.425 --> 01:02:14.144
step expert is going

2787
01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:14.905
to look back at

2788
01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.422
the changes made and

2789
01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.862
update the plan and

2790
01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:19.240
the build to have

2791
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.619
the details of the

2792
01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:22.436
implementation. The planner thinks

2793
01:02:22.436 --> 01:02:22.876
about what needs to

2794
01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:23.753
be done and then

2795
01:02:23.753 --> 01:02:25.052
its context window is

2796
01:02:25.052 --> 01:02:25.911
gone, right? We don't

2797
01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:26.710
need it anymore. The

2798
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.088
builder takes the plan

2799
01:02:28.088 --> 01:02:29.858
and actually implements it,

2800
01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:30.737
right? This is a
WEBVTT

2800
01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:30.737
right? This is a

2801
01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.715
classic pattern. Big shout

2802
01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:33.936
out to the legacy

2803
01:02:33.936 --> 01:02:35.315
AI coding tools, the

2804
01:02:35.315 --> 01:02:36.893
old school tools, Ader,

2805
01:02:36.914 --> 01:02:37.554
and all the other

2806
01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.793
tools that separated planning

2807
01:02:39.793 --> 01:02:40.572
and building. This is

2808
01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:41.291
a pattern that is

2809
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.331
going to continue across.

2810
01:02:43.331 --> 01:02:44.090
And as you saw

2811
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.329
in TAC, this pattern

2812
01:02:45.489 --> 01:02:46.750
can continue and expand

2813
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.309
across the software developer

2814
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:49.967
lifecycle. Here's our new

2815
01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.447
hook logger getting built

2816
01:02:51.447 --> 01:02:53.407
out, CHMOD. It has

2817
01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:54.826
everything it needs you

2818
01:02:54.826 --> 01:02:56.385
deploy this into single

2819
01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:57.164
file scripts, right? It

2820
01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.543
has the information, it

2821
01:02:58.543 --> 01:02:59.802
is an expert. I've

2822
01:02:59.862 --> 01:03:01.860
built an expert set
WEBVTT

2822
01:02:59.862 --> 01:03:01.860
built an expert set

2823
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.239
of agent prompts into

2824
01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.699
the codebase, okay?

2825
01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:05.518
This is what it

2826
01:03:05.518 --> 01:03:07.016
looks like to continuously

2827
01:03:07.097 --> 01:03:08.516
build and improve on

2828
01:03:08.516 --> 01:03:09.835
the agentic layer of

2829
01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:10.833
your codebase. You're

2830
01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:11.652
going to end up

2831
01:03:11.773 --> 01:03:14.092
with experts, okay? Agent

2832
01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:15.550
experts that can remember

2833
01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.188
and build and improve

2834
01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:18.048
on areas of your

2835
01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:18.907
codebase that you

2836
01:03:19.068 --> 01:03:21.686
will not remember anymore,

2837
01:03:21.686 --> 01:03:22.405
okay? you know, even

2838
01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:23.764
the best engineers, you

2839
01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:24.903
know, we just lose

2840
01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:26.083
track of this stuff

2841
01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.121
over time, all right?

2842
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:28.280
That's natural. But now

2843
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.639
we have agent experts.

2844
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.559
And yes, this is
WEBVTT

2844
01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.559
And yes, this is

2845
01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.318
another, you know, investment

2846
01:03:32.318 --> 01:03:32.876
you have to make

2847
01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:33.617
into your codebase,

2848
01:03:33.617 --> 01:03:34.775
you have to maintain

2849
01:03:34.896 --> 01:03:36.215
your agent experts, but

2850
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:36.974
this is going to

2851
01:03:36.974 --> 01:03:37.853
be, it looks like

2852
01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:38.733
our hooks are coming

2853
01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:39.431
in now. Let's go

2854
01:03:39.492 --> 01:03:40.670
ahead and look at

2855
01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.713
agents hook log. And

2856
01:03:42.713 --> 01:03:43.414
you can see there,

2857
01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:44.273
there's a couple of

2858
01:03:44.273 --> 01:03:45.253
test runs coming in.

2859
01:03:45.253 --> 01:03:45.733
It looks like this

2860
01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:46.753
agent is starting to

2861
01:03:46.753 --> 01:03:47.853
validate their own work

2862
01:03:47.952 --> 01:03:49.193
with a closed loop

2863
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:50.072
prompt. You can just

2864
01:03:50.072 --> 01:03:50.572
start to see this

2865
01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:51.592
stuff stack up very

2866
01:03:51.592 --> 01:03:53.391
quickly. Okay, so this

2867
01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:55.452
has been elite context

2868
01:03:55.572 --> 01:03:56.992
engineering, all right? This

2869
01:03:56.992 --> 01:03:57.572
is where it all

2870
01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.170
goes. Once you master
WEBVTT

2870
01:03:57.572 --> 01:04:00.170
goes. Once you master

2871
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.271
the context window of

2872
01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:02.311
a single agent, you

2873
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:03.371
can make your agent

2874
01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:04.251
do more because it

2875
01:04:04.251 --> 01:04:05.090
has more space, it's

2876
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.471
focused, and then you

2877
01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:08.150
can scale up how

2878
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.750
many agents you can

2879
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.681
control and steer at

2880
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.320
any one point in

2881
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.079
time. So now we

2882
01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:15.139
have this implemented. Let's

2883
01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:15.918
see, you always wanna

2884
01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:16.998
review the work. At

2885
01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:17.579
a high level, I

2886
01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:18.257
can just quickly come

2887
01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:19.097
in here and see

2888
01:04:19.097 --> 01:04:20.297
that looks great, universal

2889
01:04:20.317 --> 01:04:21.737
logger. Okay, looks great.

2890
01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:24.115
It is adhering properly.

2891
01:04:24.335 --> 01:04:25.635
It is aligned. Now

2892
01:04:25.635 --> 01:04:26.114
if we open up

2893
01:04:26.114 --> 01:04:27.534
a new instance here

2894
01:04:27.634 --> 01:04:28.873
and kick off Claude,

2895
01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:29.733
you can see we

2896
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.371
have this feature built
WEBVTT

2896
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.371
have this feature built

2897
01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:33.032
out exactly as specified.

2898
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:33.911
Okay, so there's the

2899
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.610
start session JSONL. We

2900
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:36.510
can type hi, we're

2901
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.668
gonna get whatever the

2902
01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:38.929
user prompts submit, and

2903
01:04:38.929 --> 01:04:39.329
then we're gonna get

2904
01:04:39.329 --> 01:04:40.527
some flows coming in.

2905
01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:41.547
ahead and run, right?

2906
01:04:41.547 --> 01:04:42.007
We got a stop

2907
01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:43.067
command. Let's go ahead

2908
01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:43.967
and run prime. This

2909
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:44.547
is going to run

2910
01:04:44.586 --> 01:04:46.326
a series of operations,

2911
01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:46.846
right? Let's go ahead

2912
01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:47.405
and kick that off.

2913
01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:47.945
And then you're going

2914
01:04:47.945 --> 01:04:48.826
to see the logs

2915
01:04:48.826 --> 01:04:49.985
come in. That was

2916
01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:51.184
built perfectly in one

2917
01:04:51.184 --> 01:04:52.525
shot with a planner

2918
01:04:52.525 --> 01:04:53.643
and a builder as

2919
01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:54.983
an expert, right? These

2920
01:04:54.983 --> 01:04:56.324
are agent experts. Let's

2921
01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:57.184
run the final step

2922
01:04:57.322 --> 01:04:58.402
and let's talk about

2923
01:04:58.402 --> 01:04:59.422
the future of context

2924
01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:00.682
engineering. Okay. So we're
WEBVTT

2924
01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:00.682
engineering. Okay. So we're

2925
01:05:00.682 --> 01:05:02.222
going to run this

2926

new Claude Code instance

2927
01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:03.922
in YOLO mode. You

2928
01:05:03.922 --> 01:05:04.802
can see that log

2929
01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.521
got appended there. Our

2930
01:05:06.521 --> 01:05:07.420
agents, right? In our

2931
01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.059
system, our agentic system

2932
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:10.039
is keeping track of

2933
01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.280
all types things now

2934
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.219
log hooks context bundles

2935
01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:13.938
we can fire off

2936
01:05:13.938 --> 01:05:14.818
background agents if we

2937
01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:15.798
want um but all

2938
01:05:15.798 --> 01:05:16.219
we want to do

2939
01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:18.277
now is expert improve

2940
01:05:18.637 --> 01:05:20.713
okay no params We

2941
01:05:20.713 --> 01:05:22.152
just improve and it

2942
01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:22.932
does this by looking

2943
01:05:22.972 --> 01:05:23.972
at the git diff.

2944
01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:24.532
It looks at any

2945
01:05:24.532 --> 01:05:25.572
changes and then it

2946
01:05:25.731 --> 01:05:27.431
makes the improvement to

2947
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:30.268
our existing build and
WEBVTT

2947
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:30.268

2950
01:05:32.967 --> 01:05:33.987
base. Okay, so you're

2951
01:05:33.987 --> 01:05:34.827
gonna see these changes

2952
01:05:34.827 --> 01:05:35.586
here flow in. You

2953
01:05:35.586 --> 01:05:37.025
can see our expert

2954
01:05:37.025 --> 01:05:38.585
is preparing, it's priming

2955
01:05:38.585 --> 01:05:40.364
itself to improve what's

2956
01:05:40.364 --> 01:05:41.103
been done. It's gonna

2957
01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.403
run a git status

2958
01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:43.063
in a second here

2959
01:05:43.063 --> 01:05:44.762
and see any relevant

2960
01:05:44.762 --> 01:05:46.621
changes that are relevant

2961
01:05:46.621 --> 01:05:48.601
specifically for the files

2962
01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:49.820
it has detailed and

2963
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.239
you can check out

2964
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:51.139
the prompts of course

2965
01:05:51.139 --> 01:05:51.978
in this codebase,

2966
01:05:51.978 --> 01:05:53.797
classic, great agentic prompt

2967
01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:54.835
engineering in all of

2968
01:05:54.835 --> 01:05:55.815
our prompts here. But

2969
01:05:55.815 --> 01:05:56.574
you can see it's

2970
01:05:56.574 --> 01:05:57.474
doing this work and

2971
01:05:57.474 --> 01:05:58.773
it's going to self

2972
01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:00.351
improve. There we go.
WEBVTT

2972
01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:00.351
improve. There we go.

2973
01:06:00.532 --> 01:06:02.469
I've identified several changes

2974
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.148
relevant learnings, relevant changes

2975
01:06:04.148 --> 01:06:05.148
from the universal log

2976
01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:06.507
implementation. That looks great.

2977
01:06:06.568 --> 01:06:07.168
If your codebase

2978
01:06:07.168 --> 01:06:07.927
is large or you

2979
01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:09.286
have a highly technical

2980
01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:11.606
area that requires your

2981
01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:13.425
expertise or another engineers

2982
01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:14.085
on your team, you

2983
01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:15.503
know, I highly recommend

2984
01:06:15.563 --> 01:06:17.282
using the agent experts

2985
01:06:17.282 --> 01:06:18.382
pattern. Of course, you'll

2986
01:06:18.382 --> 01:06:19.442
have to maintain and

2987
01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.181
monitor your expert, but

2988
01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:21.920
this is much better

2989
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.880
than having it stuck

2990
01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:23.760
in your head or

2991
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.659
an engineer's head, right?

2992
01:06:24.659 --> 01:06:26.478
You want your agentic

2993
01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:27.677
layer operating your code

2994
01:06:27.677 --> 01:06:29.057
base and you operate

2995
01:06:29.057 --> 01:06:30.077
the agentic layer, right?
WEBVTT

2995
01:06:29.057 --> 01:06:30.077
the agentic layer, right?

2996
01:06:30.197 --> 01:06:31.077
You know this. If

2997
01:06:31.077 --> 01:06:32.135
you've taken TAC, we

2998
01:06:32.135 --> 01:06:33.596
build the system that

2999
01:06:33.596 --> 01:06:35.434
builds the system. Our

3000
01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:37.733
improving meta agent expert

3001
01:06:37.733 --> 01:06:39.434
is now updating based

3002
01:06:39.434 --> 01:06:40.333
on the Git status,

3003
01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:40.932
right? Based on the

3004
01:06:40.932 --> 01:06:41.693
Git, you know, Git

3005
01:06:41.693 --> 01:06:43.251
execution run. It's updating

3006
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.652
our build and plan.

3007
01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:45.411
And here's the summary

3008
01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:46.110
of what was changed,

3009
01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:46.771
right? It just added

3010
01:06:46.771 --> 01:06:47.990
a couple sections to

3011
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.782
the expertise section. So

3012
01:06:50.782 --> 01:06:51.702
we have a dedicated

3013
01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:53.181
section inside of both

3014
01:06:53.222 --> 01:06:54.501
our plan and our

3015
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:57.221
build dedicated to specific

3016
01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.161
expertise that gets updated

3017
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.280
on the fly. It's
WEBVTT

3017
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.280
on the fly. It's

3018
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.519
dedicated, it's differentiated. We

3019
01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:02.980
don't want this to

3020
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.119
be in the workflow

3021
01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:05.320
or in the purpose

3022
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.900
or in the instructions.

3023
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:07.619
We have a dedicated

3024
01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:09.259
section built for this.

3025
01:07:09.338 --> 01:07:10.918
We're following great agentic

3026
01:07:10.918 --> 01:07:11.938
prompt engineering. We're not

3027
01:07:11.938 --> 01:07:14.378
conflating our headers. We're

3028
01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:15.737
not conflating our sections.

3029
01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:16.978
It's very important. And

3030
01:07:17.077 --> 01:07:18.518
this pattern, the agent

3031
01:07:18.518 --> 01:07:20.068
experts, It brings us

3032
01:07:20.068 --> 01:07:20.768
right back to the

3033
01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:22.065
highest leverage point of

3034
01:07:22.065 --> 01:07:23.824
agent decoding, the ADW,

3035
01:07:23.864 --> 01:07:26.380
the AI developer workflow.

3036
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.478
You can imagine a

3037
01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:28.976
workflow in ADW where

3038
01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:30.775
we string together these
WEBVTT

3038
01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:30.775
we string together these

3039
01:07:30.815 --> 01:07:32.871
three prompts in three

3040
01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:35.380
individual agents. plan, build,

3041
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.400
pass the plan to

3042
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.380
the build, and then

3043
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.780
improve, and then we

3044
01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.838
run our git commits

3045
01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:40.998
after, right? This is

3046
01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:42.436
an entire workflow. All

3047
01:07:42.436 --> 01:07:43.317
we do is pass

3048
01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:44.615
in some prompt, a

3049
01:07:44.615 --> 01:07:45.496
high-level prompt that we

3050
01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:46.275
want, and then this

3051
01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:48.434
workflow, this specialized agent

3052
01:07:48.454 --> 01:07:49.293
takes it from there,

3053
01:07:49.373 --> 01:07:49.753
okay? There are many

3054
01:07:49.753 --> 01:07:51.072
directions to go with

3055
01:07:51.072 --> 01:07:52.472
this. You can imagine

3056
01:07:52.711 --> 01:07:54.371
a router agent that

3057
01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:55.829
takes in any high-level

3058
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:57.188
prompt and then determines

3059
01:07:57.188 --> 01:07:58.407
what expert to run.

3060
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.106
There are many ways
WEBVTT

3060
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.106
There are many ways

3061
01:08:00.106 --> 01:08:01.266
and directions to take

3062
01:08:01.266 --> 01:08:01.706
this, but I wanna

3063
01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:02.905
leave that up to

3064
01:08:02.905 --> 01:08:04.324
you, take these 12

3065
01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:06.242
techniques and apply them,

3066
01:08:06.442 --> 01:08:07.400
get value out of

3067
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.639
these techniques. All right,

3068
01:08:08.798 --> 01:08:09.438
yes, it takes some

3069
01:08:09.438 --> 01:08:10.197
time. Yes, you have

3070
01:08:10.197 --> 01:08:11.496
to invest. This is

3071
01:08:11.496 --> 01:08:13.094
not vibe coding, okay?

3072
01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:14.811
If it's easy, a

3073
01:08:14.851 --> 01:08:15.791
vibe coder is probably

3074
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:16.689
doing it and that

3075
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:18.787
isn't irreplaceable, okay? That

3076
01:08:18.787 --> 01:08:20.886
is replaceable work. Even

3077
01:08:20.886 --> 01:08:21.445
one of these can

3078
01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:22.604
save you massive time,

3079
01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.545
but you have 12

3080
01:08:23.545 --> 01:08:24.703
here. Pick one, pick

3081
01:08:24.703 --> 01:08:25.923
a couple, dive into

3082
01:08:25.923 --> 01:08:27.162
them, deploy it into

3083
01:08:27.162 --> 01:08:28.023
your agentic coding to

3084
01:08:28.023 --> 01:08:29.902
improve your context engineering.
WEBVTT

3085
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:31.381
Managing your context window

3086
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.240
is the name of

3087
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.100
the game for effective

3088
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.698
agentic coding. And remember,

3089
01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:37.198
it's not necessarily about

3090
01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.677
saving tokens. It's about

3091
01:08:38.677 --> 01:08:40.636
spending them properly. We

3092
01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:41.716
manage our context window

3093
01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:42.416
so that we don't

3094
01:08:42.416 --> 01:08:44.154
waste time and tokens

3095
01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.333
correcting our agents' mistakes.

3096
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.505
We want one-shot out-loop

3097
01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:49.845
agent decoding in a

3098
01:08:49.845 --> 01:08:51.043
massive streak with the

3099
01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:52.903
fewest attempts and large

3100
01:08:52.903 --> 01:08:54.363
sizes so we can

3101
01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.634
drop our presence. In

3102
01:08:56.634 --> 01:08:57.832
TAC, we use specialized

3103
01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.592
agents, we delegated and

3104
01:08:59.592 --> 01:09:00.832
we reduced the context
WEBVTT

3104
01:08:59.592 --> 01:09:00.832
we reduced the context

3105
01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.252
window of our agents

3106
01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:04.390
by building specialized ADWs

3107
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.791
that shipped on our

3108
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.189
behalf. So the big

3109
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.029
idea here is simple.

3110
01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.449
It's measure and manage

3111
01:09:09.489 --> 01:09:10.050
one of the most

3112
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:11.828
obviously critical leverage points

3113
01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:13.009
of agentic coding, your

3114
01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:14.547
agent's context window. Here

3115
01:09:14.547 --> 01:09:15.887
are a few future

3116
01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:17.606
context engineering trends you

3117
01:09:17.606 --> 01:09:18.487
can bet on coming

3118
01:09:18.506 --> 01:09:19.447
out of the big

3119
01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:20.746
AI labs. You can

3120
01:09:20.746 --> 01:09:22.386
imagine a larger context

3121
01:09:22.386 --> 01:09:23.444
windows. All right, this

3122
01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:24.984
is obvious and self-explanatory.

3123
01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:26.623
We want more context

3124
01:09:26.644 --> 01:09:27.983
to get around the

3125
01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:30.061
compact problem. Right next
WEBVTT

3125
01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:30.061
compact problem. Right next

3126
01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.060
to that and very,

3127
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.060
very closely related, we

3128
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060
are likely to see

3129
01:09:33.121 --> 01:09:34.539
better context windows coming

3130
01:09:34.539 --> 01:09:35.000
out of these big

3131
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.559
labs. Language models, they

3132
01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:37.938
tend to lose massive

3133
01:09:37.978 --> 01:09:39.737
capability as the context

3134
01:09:39.737 --> 01:09:41.056
size grows. This is

3135
01:09:41.056 --> 01:09:42.695
an attention mechanism problem

3136
01:09:42.815 --> 01:09:44.194
inside of modern agents.

3137
01:09:44.274 --> 01:09:45.234
You can plan and

3138
01:09:45.234 --> 01:09:46.394
bet on big labs

3139
01:09:46.394 --> 01:09:49.012
focusing on better effective

3140
01:09:49.012 --> 01:09:50.992
context windows. Okay, another

3141
01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:51.832
big idea Here is

3142
01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.810
hot swapped context windows,

3143
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:55.291
hot swapping tools, hot

3144
01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.010
swapping context in general,

3145
01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.390
right? Hot swapping the

3146
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.948
system prompt like cloud

3147
01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.088
codes, output styles enable
WEBVTT

3147
01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.088
codes, output styles enable

3148
01:10:02.088 --> 01:10:02.847
us to do, right?

3149
01:10:02.847 --> 01:10:03.908
You can overwrite and

3150
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.247
therefore hot swapping existing

3151
01:10:06.247 --> 01:10:07.087
system prompt. This is

3152
01:10:07.087 --> 01:10:08.567
an important, interesting pattern.

3153
01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:09.706
Imagine for every piece

3154
01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.636
of context, user prompts,

3155
01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:12.996
assistant prompts, tool calls,

3156
01:10:12.996 --> 01:10:14.114
system. You can swap

3157
01:10:14.135 --> 01:10:15.094
in and out different

3158
01:10:15.113 --> 01:10:16.292
contexts, right? You can

3159
01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:17.711
delete context to free

3160
01:10:17.711 --> 01:10:18.511
up the context window,

3161
01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:20.149
okay? Hot swapping context

3162
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.927
is a big idea

3163
01:10:21.148 --> 01:10:22.046
we're likely gonna see,

3164
01:10:22.046 --> 01:10:23.818
okay? The last two

3165
01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:24.896
are very obvious. You

3166
01:10:24.896 --> 01:10:25.516
can see these if

3167
01:10:25.516 --> 01:10:26.096
you're on the edge,

3168
01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.256
you're already doing this

3169
01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.216
and you're using TAC

3170
01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:28.755
to help you get

3171
01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:30.534
there faster, quicker, better.
WEBVTT

3171
01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:30.534
there faster, quicker, better.

3172
01:10:30.534 --> 01:10:32.373
Multi-agent architectures for agent

3173
01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:33.613
delegation. Okay, we touched

3174
01:10:33.613 --> 01:10:34.412
on this several times

3175
01:10:34.412 --> 01:10:35.612
throughout TAC and here

3176
01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:36.731
we use sub-agents and

3177
01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:38.350
primary agent delegation. Okay,

3178
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:39.630
and then lastly, a

3179
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.329
big trend you can

3180
01:10:40.329 --> 01:10:42.828
bet on, specialized agents

3181
01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:44.127
everywhere. On the bleeding

3182
01:10:44.127 --> 01:10:45.268
edge, you plug into

3183
01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:46.606
the Claude Code SDK

3184
01:10:46.726 --> 01:10:48.126
and other agent SDKs

3185
01:10:48.145 --> 01:10:50.024
and you specialize every

3186
01:10:50.024 --> 01:10:51.204
element of the context,

3187
01:10:51.204 --> 01:10:52.363
the model, the prompt,

3188
01:10:52.363 --> 01:10:54.143
the tools solve and

3189
01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.641
deliver unique experiences for

3190
01:10:56.641 --> 01:10:57.400
your users and for

3191
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.039
your customers. Okay. What's

3192
01:10:59.039 --> 01:10:59.859
better than a prompt?

3193
01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.099
A prompt chain. What's
WEBVTT

3193
01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.099
A prompt chain. What's

3194
01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:01.677
better than a prompt

3195
01:11:01.677 --> 01:11:03.457
chain? An agent. What's

3196
01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:04.296
better than an agent?

3197
01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:07.373
Many focused, specialized agents

3198
01:11:07.373 --> 01:11:09.252
that deliver value for

3199
01:11:09.252 --> 01:11:10.391
you, for your team,

3200
01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:11.412
and most importantly, for

3201
01:11:11.412 --> 01:11:12.631
your customers and users.

3202
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:13.630
Don't miss this trend.

3203
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:14.988
You now have everything

3204
01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:15.748
you need to win

3205
01:11:15.748 --> 01:11:17.686
and ship with focused,

3206
01:11:17.686 --> 01:11:20.997
single-purposed agents. So all

3207
01:11:20.997 --> 01:11:22.497
these techniques are us

3208
01:11:22.617 --> 01:11:23.775
battling with the fact

3209
01:11:23.775 --> 01:11:24.595
that there are key

3210
01:11:24.595 --> 01:11:26.435
scaling laws and algorithms

3211
01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:27.514
inside of these language

3212
01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:28.793
models, inside of generative

3213
01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.872
AI that decreases performance
WEBVTT

3213
01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.872
AI that decreases performance

3214
01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:32.492
as context window grows.

3215
01:11:32.511 --> 01:11:33.171
What does that mean?

3216
01:11:33.171 --> 01:11:33.692
It means you can

3217
01:11:33.692 --> 01:11:35.690
safely bet on spending

3218
01:11:35.711 --> 01:11:37.449
your engineering time, energy,

3219
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.088
and resources on investing

3220
01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:41.127
in great context management,

3221
01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:42.527
in great context engineering.

3222
01:11:42.546 --> 01:11:43.167
It's a safe bet

3223
01:11:43.186 --> 01:11:44.826
to bet on context

3224
01:11:44.826 --> 01:11:46.326
engineering. With all the

3225
01:11:46.326 --> 01:11:48.364
focus on context, let's

3226
01:11:48.364 --> 01:11:50.083
not forget about prompt

3227
01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:52.201
engineering and specifically agentic

3228
01:11:52.359 --> 01:11:54.377
prompt engineering. If you're

3229
01:11:54.396 --> 01:11:55.515
writing bad prompts, your

3230
01:11:55.515 --> 01:11:57.811
context doesn't matter. If

3231
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.030
you can't communicate what

3232
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.048
you want done with
WEBVTT

3232
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.048
you want done with

3233
01:12:00.048 --> 01:12:01.127
your agents when you're

3234
01:12:01.127 --> 01:12:03.246
delegating when you're reducing

3235
01:12:03.246 --> 01:12:04.645
context, you're going to

3236
01:12:04.645 --> 01:12:05.944
be massively limited and

3237
01:12:05.965 --> 01:12:06.444
you're going to be

3238
01:12:06.444 --> 01:12:07.564
shooting yourself in the

3239
01:12:07.564 --> 01:12:09.024
foot, wasting money, right?

3240
01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:09.604
If you want to

3241
01:12:09.604 --> 01:12:10.925
write the best prompts

3242
01:12:10.944 --> 01:12:11.863
and preserve your context

3243
01:12:11.863 --> 01:12:12.604
window, you want to

3244
01:12:12.604 --> 01:12:13.503
be stacking up these

3245
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.783
big ideas. You'll get

3246
01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:16.024
a ton of value

3247
01:12:16.384 --> 01:12:17.404
out of the agentic

3248
01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:19.502
prompt engineering extended lesson

3249
01:12:19.662 --> 01:12:20.483
I've built out for

3250
01:12:20.523 --> 01:12:22.703
this very purpose. That

3251
01:12:22.823 --> 01:12:24.782
agentic horizon lesson is

3252
01:12:24.782 --> 01:12:26.721
dedicated purely to agentic

3253
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.402
prompt engineering in the

3254
01:12:28.402 --> 01:12:29.761
age of agents. We'll

3255
01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:31.060
be optimizing prompts for
WEBVTT

3255
01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:31.060
be optimizing prompts for

3256
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.541
Claude Code, but really

3257
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.899
all agent decoding tools.

3258
01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:34.479
We're betting on the

3259
01:12:34.479 --> 01:12:35.859
winner and we're preparing

3260
01:12:35.859 --> 01:12:37.078
for competitors. And of

3277
01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:01.770
here. There is a

3278
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.029
lot to digest. This

me. Keep in mind,

3283
01:13:07.326 --> 01:13:08.725
a focused agent is

3284
01:13:08.725 --> 01:13:10.203
a performant agent. I'll

3285
01:13:10.203 --> 01:13:11.083
see you in TAC

3286
01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:11.724
