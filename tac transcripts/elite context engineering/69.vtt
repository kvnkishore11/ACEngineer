1520
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.590
see it is summarizing.

1521
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.009
decently here. Usually it

1522
00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:32.768
has some type of

1523
00:34:32.807 --> 00:34:34.106
read file command where

1524
00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:35.605
it automatically read some

1525
00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:36.903
additional files, right? You

1526
00:34:36.903 --> 00:34:37.523
know, you can understand

1527
00:34:37.523 --> 00:34:38.262
why they did this.

1528
00:34:38.262 --> 00:34:39.001
The context window is

1529
00:34:39.001 --> 00:34:40.260
limited. They're facing the

1530
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.539
same limitations as you

1531
00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:42.159
and I, and they

1532
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.157
want to provide solutions

1533
00:34:43.157 --> 00:34:44.257
for them. But just

1534
00:34:44.257 --> 00:34:45.335
like your prompts, the

1535
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:46.713
context window of your

1536
00:34:46.713 --> 00:34:48.253
agents should not be

1537
00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:49.650
handed off to any

1538
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.494
tool or team. The

1539
00:34:51.494 --> 00:34:52.833
compact command for what

1540
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:53.931
it's worth is great,

1541
00:34:53.972 --> 00:34:54.851
but it's a bandaid

1542
00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:55.889
fix for the true

1543
00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.568
problem. The context window

1544
00:34:57.568 --> 00:34:58.728
has grown large and

1545
00:34:58.728 --> 00:35:00.606
cannot fit any additional
