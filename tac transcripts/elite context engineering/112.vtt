2503
00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:00.655
and focus agents by

2504
00:56:00.655 --> 00:56:02.536
building out some type

2505
00:56:02.695 --> 00:56:04.295
of primary agent delegation

2506
00:56:04.295 --> 00:56:05.115
workflow you can see

2507
00:56:05.115 --> 00:56:07.114
here in just one

2508
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.574
prompt we have a

2509
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:10.635
full Claude Code instance

2510
00:56:10.655 --> 00:56:12.094
in the background doing

2511
00:56:12.094 --> 00:56:12.894
work for us that

2512
00:56:12.894 --> 00:56:14.275
we know we don't

2513
00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:15.695
need to monitor anymore

2514
00:56:15.775 --> 00:56:16.815
and the more you

2515
00:56:16.815 --> 00:56:17.954
become comfortable and the

2516
00:56:17.954 --> 00:56:19.755
more your agentic engineering

2517
00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:21.253
skill improves the more

2518
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.954
you can stop babysitting

2519
00:56:23.014 --> 00:56:24.753
every single agent instance

2520
00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:25.514
okay this is a

2521
00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:26.114
big theme in tech

2522
00:56:26.114 --> 00:56:27.313
we want to scale

2523
00:56:27.353 --> 00:56:28.610
from in loop to

2524
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.849
Outloop to ZTE. Speaking
