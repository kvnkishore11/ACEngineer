775
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.990
you the scale in

776
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.689
which this is important.

777
00:18:32.709 --> 00:18:33.488
Let's run a classic

778
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:34.967
prompt. What does this

779
00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:35.967
codebase do? And

780
00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:36.766
I'm gonna copy that.

781
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:37.526
kick it off here,

782
00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:38.326
kick it off here.

783
00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:38.884
So these are both

784
00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.045
the sonnet models. They're

785
00:18:40.045 --> 00:18:41.085
both going down their

786
00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:42.804
non-deterministic path. Here is

787
00:18:42.804 --> 00:18:44.084
our verbose on the

788
00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:45.104
right, and here is

789
00:18:45.104 --> 00:18:46.403
our one word on

790
00:18:46.403 --> 00:18:47.643
the left. So again,

791
00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:49.002
just take note of

792
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.102
the difference here, right?

793
00:18:50.102 --> 00:18:50.801
And let's go ahead

794
00:18:50.801 --> 00:18:52.442
and run slash context

795
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:53.461
on the left, slash

796
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:54.461
context on the right.

797
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.700
And let's just briefly

798
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.759
look at the output

799
00:18:57.779 --> 00:18:58.740
tokens here. So we

800
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.038
can see there's no
