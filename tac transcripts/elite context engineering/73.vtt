1611
00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.427
you shouldn't need slash

1612
00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:32.646
compact and if you

1613
00:36:32.646 --> 00:36:33.726
need to you should

1614
00:36:33.726 --> 00:36:35.567
reset and prime now

1615
00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:36.465
we can push this

1616
00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.405
idea a little bit

1617
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:38.626
further and try to

1618
00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:40.137
do what the compact

1619
00:36:40.137 --> 00:36:41.836
window command is doing

1620
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:43.476
ourselves with our next

1621
00:36:43.516 --> 00:36:45.476
advanced context engineering technique.

1622
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:49.414
Notice that with each

1623
00:36:49.414 --> 00:36:50.375
technique from beginner to

1624
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.974
intermediate to advanced and

1625
00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.414
soon agentic, we're doing

1626
00:36:53.474 --> 00:36:54.693
R and D, reduce

1627
00:36:54.693 --> 00:36:55.833
and delegate. We're keeping

1628
00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:56.833
track of our context

1629
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:57.693
window at all times

1630
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:58.932
and we're not outsourcing

1631
00:36:58.932 --> 00:36:59.432
it. If you wanna

1632
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:01.152
scale your agents, monitoring
