640
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:30.726
working on the agentic

641
00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:31.785
layer. We're building the

642
00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:33.583
system that builds the

643
00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.101
system. So prime, right?

644
00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:37.057
Don't default. Your claw.md

645
00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:38.216
file should be shrunk

646
00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:39.774
to contain only the

647
00:15:39.774 --> 00:15:42.753
absolute universal essentials that

648
00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:44.731
you're 100% sure you

649
00:15:44.731 --> 00:15:46.211
want loaded 100% of

650
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:46.951
the time. You see

651
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:48.668
how powerful that conditional

652
00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:49.729
is and how strict

653
00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:50.768
that conditional is? So

654
00:15:50.768 --> 00:15:51.807
be very careful with

655
00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:53.006
these memory files, keep

656
00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:54.745
them slim, and instead

657
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:56.823
prefer context priming. This

658
00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:57.884
way you can build

659
00:15:57.884 --> 00:15:59.403
up many areas of

660
00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.644
focus for your agents.
