01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:30.534
there faster, quicker, better.

3172
01:10:30.534 --> 01:10:32.373
Multi-agent architectures for agent

3173
01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:33.613
delegation. Okay, we touched

3174
01:10:33.613 --> 01:10:34.412
on this several times

3175
01:10:34.412 --> 01:10:35.612
throughout TAC and here

3176
01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:36.731
we use sub-agents and

3177
01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:38.350
primary agent delegation. Okay,

3178
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:39.630
and then lastly, a

3179
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:40.329
big trend you can

3180
01:10:40.329 --> 01:10:42.828
bet on, specialized agents

3181
01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:44.127
everywhere. On the bleeding

3182
01:10:44.127 --> 01:10:45.268
edge, you plug into

3183
01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:46.606
the Claude Code SDK

3184
01:10:46.726 --> 01:10:48.126
and other agent SDKs

3185
01:10:48.145 --> 01:10:50.024
and you specialize every

3186
01:10:50.024 --> 01:10:51.204
element of the context,

3187
01:10:51.204 --> 01:10:52.363
the model, the prompt,

3188
01:10:52.363 --> 01:10:54.143
the tools solve and

3189
01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.641
deliver unique experiences for

3190
01:10:56.641 --> 01:10:57.400
your users and for

3191
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.039
your customers. Okay. What's

3192
01:10:59.039 --> 01:10:59.859
better than a prompt?

3193
01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.099
A prompt chain. What's
