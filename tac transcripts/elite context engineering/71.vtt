1564
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.452
like the first advanced

1565
00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:32.012
technique, basically just saying

1566
00:35:32.112 --> 00:35:33.012
do more work. Don't

1567
00:35:33.012 --> 00:35:33.731
depend on the slash

1568
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.990
compact command. Why do

1569
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.731
we do this? It's

1570
00:35:35.731 --> 00:35:36.730
because this way you

1571
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.630
know exactly what's in

1572
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.168
your context window and

1573
00:35:39.168 --> 00:35:39.648
you get in the

1574
00:35:39.648 --> 00:35:41.487
habit of building tasks

1575
00:35:41.507 --> 00:35:43.927
specific context priming prompts,

1576
00:35:43.987 --> 00:35:44.768
all right? Just like

1577
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:46.507
our beginner techniques adjust.

1578
00:35:46.547 --> 00:35:47.786
These techniques stack up

1579
00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:48.746
on each other very,

1580
00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:49.927
very quickly. The big

1581
00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:50.586
idea here is you

1582
00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:52.007
don't wanna delegate the

1583
00:35:52.007 --> 00:35:53.786
control of your context

1584
00:35:53.786 --> 00:35:54.585
window, all right? This

1585
00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.505
is a dangerous game

1586
00:35:55.505 --> 00:35:56.585
to play. You want

1587
00:35:56.606 --> 00:35:57.606
to own this just

1588
00:35:57.606 --> 00:35:58.786
like you wanna control

1589
00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.057
your prompt or your
