2481
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.469
here. Okay, so there's

2482
00:55:30.469 --> 00:55:31.588
a lot more control

2483
00:55:31.588 --> 00:55:33.967
here. This background agent

2484
00:55:34.088 --> 00:55:35.387
and the prompt that

2485
00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:36.126
I passed in, right?

2486
00:55:36.126 --> 00:55:36.746
We can just paste

2487
00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:37.686
this prompt. I could

2488
00:55:37.686 --> 00:55:39.264
have asked for anything

2489
00:55:39.264 --> 00:55:40.585
here, right? This doesn't

2490
00:55:40.585 --> 00:55:40.885
need to be a

2491
00:55:40.905 --> 00:55:41.983
quick plan. I could

2492
00:55:41.983 --> 00:55:43.842
have asked for a

2493
00:55:43.842 --> 00:55:46.722
multi-agent workflow running sub-agents,

2494
00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:48.021
right? There's just so

2495
00:55:48.021 --> 00:55:49.800
many ways to build

2496
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.940
and to use multi-agent

2497
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.219
systems. The key idea

2498
00:55:52.219 --> 00:55:53.358
here is, let's bring

2499
00:55:53.358 --> 00:55:54.039
it all back to

2500
00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:55.418
context engineering. The key

2501
00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.657
idea here is you

2502
00:55:56.657 --> 00:55:58.996
can delegate specialized work

2503
00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:00.655
and focus agents by
