168
00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.225
context, you will not

169
00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:32.545
find this information and

170
00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:33.684
you will not know

171
00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:34.744
that we've already spent

172
00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.562
31% of our available

173
00:04:36.562 --> 00:04:38.281
context window. Our second

174
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.740
mechanism for understanding context

175
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.000
is token counters. In

176
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.079
the bottom right of

177
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.199
my instance here, you

178
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.178
can see I have

179
00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.697
a token counter counting

180
00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:47.858
the number of tokens

181
00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:49.536
highlighted and in the

182
00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:51.456
file. We have 2,600

183
00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:52.975
tokens available in the

184
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:54.553
README. So anytime our

185
00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:55.673
agent interacts with the

186
00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:56.732
README, which is a

187
00:04:56.732 --> 00:04:58.091
high touch point for

188
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.422
agents, they'll consume 2000
