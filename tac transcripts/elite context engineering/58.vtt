1269
00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:00.866
reusable prompt in this

1270
00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:02.145
codebase called Quick

1271
00:29:02.145 --> 00:29:03.670
Plan. All right, and

1272
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.730
all it does is

1273
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.269
if we open up

1274
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:06.828
a quick plan, this

1275
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:08.828
accepts a single argument,

1276
00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:09.528
which is the user

1277
00:29:09.528 --> 00:29:10.887
prompt. Inside of TAC,

1278
00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:11.728
you're very familiar with

1279
00:29:11.728 --> 00:29:12.948
this pattern. We built

1280
00:29:12.948 --> 00:29:14.387
out and extrapolated on

1281
00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:15.666
this in the software

1282
00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:17.086
developer lifecycle for the

1283
00:29:17.086 --> 00:29:18.166
plan phase, but quick

1284
00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:19.207
plan is roughly the

1285
00:29:19.207 --> 00:29:20.486
same idea. You have

1286
00:29:20.486 --> 00:29:21.685
a single prompt that's

1287
00:29:21.685 --> 00:29:23.724
focused on just planning.

1288
00:29:23.724 --> 00:29:24.503
So let's plan some

1289
00:29:24.503 --> 00:29:25.503
work, right? Let's push

1290
00:29:25.503 --> 00:29:26.742
that Claude Code TypeScript

1291
00:29:26.842 --> 00:29:28.221
SDK a little bit

1292
00:29:28.221 --> 00:29:29.880
further and create a

1293
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.598
small reusable codebase
