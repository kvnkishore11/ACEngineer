1801
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.003
we can reference in

1802
00:40:31.003 --> 00:40:33.206
subsequent agents. And the

1803
00:40:33.206 --> 00:40:33.905
great part here is

1804
00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:34.945
of course you can

1805
00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:36.483
conditionally use this. A

1806
00:40:36.483 --> 00:40:37.083
lot of the times

1807
00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:37.862
you won't need to

1808
00:40:37.862 --> 00:40:39.503
reload the entire context

1809
00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.641
bundle because it won't

1810
00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:41.402
be relevant. But if

1811
00:40:41.402 --> 00:40:42.260
we needed to, we

1812
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.141
could get the entire

1813
00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.159
replay of the agent

1814
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.159
up to the point

1815
00:40:46.298 --> 00:40:47.619
in which the context

1816
00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.277
overloaded without all of

1817
00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:50.597
the rights and without

1818
00:40:50.597 --> 00:40:52.217
all the details of

1819
00:40:52.217 --> 00:40:53.436
all the reads. The

1820
00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:54.815
trimmed down version is

1821
00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:56.014
super important, right? We're

1822
00:40:56.014 --> 00:40:57.753
not recording every operation.

1823
00:40:57.793 --> 00:40:58.333
If we do that,

1824
00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:59.092
we'll just end up

1825
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:00.893
overflowing the next agent's
