00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.011
prime CC command to

617
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:02.509
where we're stacking prompts

618
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:03.408
to better manage our

619
00:15:03.408 --> 00:15:04.687
context window. And then

620
00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:05.187
you can see here,

621
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:06.126
we're just saying read

622
00:15:06.126 --> 00:15:07.306
a couple extra files

623
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.044
and do the same

624
00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:09.283
thing, report your understanding

625
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.062
of the codebase.

626
00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:11.561
Even with this small

627
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.480
example, elite context engineering

628
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.057
codebase, there's already

629
00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:16.655
room for specialization. Are

630
00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:17.115
we working on the

631
00:15:17.135 --> 00:15:18.095
app level or are

632
00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:19.134
we working on the

633
00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:21.438
Claude agent level, right?

634
00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:22.337
And as you know

635
00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:23.476
from tech, we are

636
00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:24.894
talking here whenever we're

637
00:15:24.894 --> 00:15:26.273
working on the agents,

638
00:15:26.312 --> 00:15:27.811
we're talking about the

639
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.369
agentic layer, right? We're

640
00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:30.726
working on the agentic
