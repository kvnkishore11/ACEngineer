WEBVTT

2640
00:58:59.717 --> 00:59:00.795
our workflow. But the

2641
00:59:00.795 --> 00:59:02.034
key here is we

2642
00:59:02.034 --> 00:59:04.333
have a three-step agent

2643
00:59:04.414 --> 00:59:05.634
expert. Let's open this

2644
00:59:05.634 --> 00:59:06.434
file explorer up again

2645
00:59:06.434 --> 00:59:06.893
and you can see

2646
00:59:06.893 --> 00:59:07.753
here we have plan,

2647
00:59:07.853 --> 00:59:09.353
build, improve and it

2648
00:59:09.353 --> 00:59:11.152
runs in that flow.

2649
00:59:11.413 --> 00:59:12.472
Okay, so this agent

2650
00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:13.492
right now is planning

2651
00:59:13.492 --> 00:59:14.411
for us. It's a

2652
00:59:14.652 --> 00:59:16.831
specialized Claude Code hook

2653
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:18.291
planner agent. So it's

2654
00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:20.210
built just for planning

2655
00:59:20.331 --> 00:59:21.650
Claude Code hook related

2656
00:59:21.751 --> 00:59:23.150
functionality. We'll then pass

2657
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.050
it off to our

2658
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.090
expert builder, which is

2659
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.048
gonna take the path

2660
00:59:27.048 --> 00:59:28.148
to the spec that

2661
00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:29.389
our planner created, and

2662
00:59:29.389 --> 00:59:30.168
the agent that runs
