00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.849
Outloop to ZTE. Speaking

2525
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:32.327
of specialization, speaking of

2526
00:56:32.527 --> 00:56:33.447
all these big ideas,

2527
00:56:33.447 --> 00:56:34.706
let's wrap up with

2528
00:56:34.786 --> 00:56:35.646
potentially one of the

2529
00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:37.945
most powerful context engineering

2530
00:56:37.945 --> 00:56:39.425
techniques. Let's talk about

2531
00:56:39.465 --> 00:56:44.663
agent experts. So what

2532
00:56:44.663 --> 00:56:45.402
does this all build

2533
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:46.621
up to? We've already,

2534
00:56:46.965 --> 00:56:48.344
covered the main idea,

2535
00:56:48.465 --> 00:56:49.925
right? Build focused agents,

2536
00:56:49.985 --> 00:56:51.623
deploy them in ADWs

2537
00:56:51.643 --> 00:56:53.802
with specialized pipelines, protect

2538
00:56:53.822 --> 00:56:54.882
your context window at

2539
00:56:54.882 --> 00:56:56.001
all costs inside of

2540
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:57.521
every agent. But once

2541
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:57.960
you put all this

2542
00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.719
together, you can get

2543
00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:00.179
something really special, something
