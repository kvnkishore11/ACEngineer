2618
00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.797
gonna have our Cloud

2619
00:58:30.797 --> 00:58:32.577
Code hook expert build

2620
00:58:32.597 --> 00:58:34.378
this directory structure. Agents,

2621
00:58:34.458 --> 00:58:36.358
hook logs, session ID,

2622
00:58:36.557 --> 00:58:38.077
name of hook, okay?

2623
00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:39.050
Let's fire this off

2624
00:58:39.168 --> 00:58:41.108
and let's understand what

2625
00:58:41.108 --> 00:58:42.447
our expert can do.

2626
00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:43.847
All right, so let's

2627
00:58:43.847 --> 00:58:44.666
open up this prompt.

2628
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:45.605
We want the Cloud

2629
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:47.443
Code Hook Expert plan.

2630
00:58:47.603 --> 00:58:48.143
This is gonna look

2631
00:58:48.284 --> 00:58:49.742
very similar with an

2632
00:58:49.742 --> 00:58:50.961
additional section that you

2633
00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:52.240
probably haven't seen before.

2634
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.521
We have an expertise

2635
00:58:53.521 --> 00:58:55.278
section. Now, this section

2636
00:58:55.478 --> 00:58:56.239
on its own, it's

2637
00:58:56.239 --> 00:58:56.878
not that useful. It's

2638
00:58:56.878 --> 00:58:57.998
not that different really

2639
00:58:58.077 --> 00:58:59.717
than our instructions or

2640
00:58:59.717 --> 00:59:00.795
our workflow. But the
