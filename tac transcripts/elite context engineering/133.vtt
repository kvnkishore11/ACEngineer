3008
01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:46.110

a couple sections to

3011
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.782
the expertise section. So

3012
01:06:50.782 --> 01:06:51.702
we have a dedicated

3013
01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:53.181
section inside of both

3014
01:06:53.222 --> 01:06:54.501
our plan and our

3015
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:57.221

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.161
