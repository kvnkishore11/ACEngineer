2684
00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.922
this area of focus

2685
01:00:00.922 --> 01:00:01.902
okay a lot of

2686
01:00:01.942 --> 01:00:02.461
the work i do

2687
01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:03.532
is aimed at showing

2688
01:00:03.532 --> 01:00:04.512
you the vision and

2689
01:00:04.512 --> 01:00:05.293
giving you the new

2690
01:00:05.293 --> 01:00:06.692
beliefs and the new

2691
01:00:06.692 --> 01:00:08.931
ideas, the new context

2692
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:10.110
that you need to

2693
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.648
deploy agents, to deploy

2694
01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:13.608
generative AI in new

2695
01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.567
forward leaning ways. Okay,

2696
01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:16.106
so this is just

2697
01:00:16.106 --> 01:00:17.045
one idea, but you

2698
01:00:17.045 --> 01:00:18.925
can imagine multiple experts

2699
01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.583
across your codebase

2700
01:00:20.623 --> 01:00:22.043
that are extraordinary. They're

2701
01:00:22.043 --> 01:00:22.802
like the engineer on

2702
01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:23.902
your team that knows

2703
01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:24.981
that one piece of

2704
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:26.701
code, that one feature

2705
01:00:26.701 --> 01:00:28.139
better than anyone. Now

2706
01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:29.179
you can encode this,

2707
01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:30.358
you can template it
