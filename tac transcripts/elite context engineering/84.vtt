1870
00:41:58.987 --> 00:42:00.007
the full version of

1871
00:42:00.007 --> 00:42:00.947
this, but once you

1872
00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:01.927
start doing this well,

1873
00:42:01.927 --> 00:42:02.947
you'll start engineering and

1874
00:42:02.947 --> 00:42:04.327
problem solving in this

1875
00:42:04.327 --> 00:42:06.286
two-step workflow. First, you

1876
00:42:06.286 --> 00:42:07.086
plan out the work

1877
00:42:07.086 --> 00:42:08.467
you want done without

1878
00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:10.387
regard for technology. Okay.

1879
00:42:10.387 --> 00:42:11.887
You'll focus on just

1880
00:42:11.887 --> 00:42:13.326
solving the problem for

1881
00:42:13.326 --> 00:42:14.346
your users, for your

1882
00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:16.286
customers, right? Always remember,

1883
00:42:16.385 --> 00:42:17.244
Your users and customers

1884
00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.483
come first. The technology

1885
00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:19.123
we use is a

1886
00:42:19.123 --> 00:42:20.621
means to this end.

1887
00:42:20.885 --> 00:42:22.105
Then you'll plan out

1888
00:42:22.224 --> 00:42:23.565
how you'll delegate your

1889
00:42:23.565 --> 00:42:26.402
work across several agents,

1890
00:42:26.402 --> 00:42:28.362
forming an agentic pipeline,

1891
00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:29.842
also known as an

1892
00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:31.800
AI developer workflow, the
