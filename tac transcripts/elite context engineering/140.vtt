01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.088
codes, output styles enable

3148
01:10:02.088 --> 01:10:02.847
us to do, right?

3149
01:10:02.847 --> 01:10:03.908
You can overwrite and

3150
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.247
therefore hot swapping existing

3151
01:10:06.247 --> 01:10:07.087
system prompt. This is

3152
01:10:07.087 --> 01:10:08.567
an important, interesting pattern.

3153
01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:09.706
Imagine for every piece

3154
01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.636
of context, user prompts,

3155
01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:12.996
assistant prompts, tool calls,

3156
01:10:12.996 --> 01:10:14.114
system. You can swap

3157
01:10:14.135 --> 01:10:15.094
in and out different

3158
01:10:15.113 --> 01:10:16.292
contexts, right? You can

3159
01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:17.711
delete context to free

3160
01:10:17.711 --> 01:10:18.511
up the context window,

3161
01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:20.149
okay? Hot swapping context

3162
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.927
is a big idea

3163
01:10:21.148 --> 01:10:22.046
we're likely gonna see,

3164
01:10:22.046 --> 01:10:23.818
okay? The last two

3165
01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:24.896
are very obvious. You

3166
01:10:24.896 --> 01:10:25.516
can see these if

3167
01:10:25.516 --> 01:10:26.096
you're on the edge,

3168
01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.256
you're already doing this

3169
01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.216
and you're using TAC

3170
01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:28.755
to help you get

3171
01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:30.534
there faster, quicker, better.
