1335
00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:30.193
not realizing that they're

1336
00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:32.232
causing context rot and

1337
00:30:32.232 --> 00:30:33.672
context bloat with every

1338
00:30:33.672 --> 00:30:35.451
prompt that isn't laser

1339
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:36.891
focused to the task

1340
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:38.150
at hand. With our

1341
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.329
planning prompt, we have

1342
00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:40.848
a detailed prompt in

1343
00:30:40.848 --> 00:30:42.708
our classic instruction prompt

1344
00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:44.346
format. Again, check out

1345
00:30:44.507 --> 00:30:45.766
a Genetic Prompt Engineering

1346
00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:47.486
extended lesson on the

1347
00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.224
powerful prompt structures that

1348
00:30:49.224 --> 00:30:50.223
you can write. And

1349
00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:51.023
we're being very, very

1350
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:52.803
clear about what it

1351
00:30:52.803 --> 00:30:53.762
needs to do. We're

1352
00:30:53.843 --> 00:30:55.546
planning work. and we're

1353
00:30:55.546 --> 00:30:56.424
planning work with a

1354
00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:58.643
powerful Opus agent. Again,

1355
00:30:58.862 --> 00:30:59.281
if you're in the

1356
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:00.340
future, I hope you
