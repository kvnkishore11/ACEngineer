01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:30.872
AI that decreases performance

3214
01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:32.492
as context window grows.

3215
01:11:32.511 --> 01:11:33.171
What does that mean?

3216
01:11:33.171 --> 01:11:33.692
It means you can

3217
01:11:33.692 --> 01:11:35.690
safely bet on spending

3218
01:11:35.711 --> 01:11:37.449
your engineering time, energy,

3219
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.088
and resources on investing

3220
01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:41.127
in great context management,

3221
01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:42.527
in great context engineering.

3222
01:11:42.546 --> 01:11:43.167
It's a safe bet

3223
01:11:43.186 --> 01:11:44.826
to bet on context

3224
01:11:44.826 --> 01:11:46.326
engineering. With all the

3225
01:11:46.326 --> 01:11:48.364
focus on context, let's

3226
01:11:48.364 --> 01:11:50.083
not forget about prompt

3227
01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:52.201
engineering and specifically agentic

3228
01:11:52.359 --> 01:11:54.377
prompt engineering. If you're

3229
01:11:54.396 --> 01:11:55.515
writing bad prompts, your

3230
01:11:55.515 --> 01:11:57.811
context doesn't matter. If

3231
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.030
you can't communicate what

3232
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.048
you want done with
