2205
00:49:29.626 --> 00:49:30.985
level we can kick

2206
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:32.605
off primary agents through

2207
00:49:32.605 --> 00:49:35.023
prompts, through wrapper CLIs,

2208
00:49:35.103 --> 00:49:36.742
through MCP servers, and

2209
00:49:36.742 --> 00:49:38.360
through UIs. You've likely

2210
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.221
seen a lot of

2211
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.739
Claude Code management systems

2212
00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:42.298
and a lot of

2213
00:49:42.338 --> 00:49:43.838
agent systems get built

2214
00:49:43.838 --> 00:49:44.856
up into their own

2215
00:49:44.936 --> 00:49:46.856
UIs. That is primary

2216
00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:49.134
agent delegation. Now, what's

2217
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:51.164
the most lightweight version

2218
00:49:51.164 --> 00:49:52.563
of multi-agent delegation. You

2219
00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:54.222
can use ASAP and

2220
00:49:54.222 --> 00:49:55.181
get value out of

2221
00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.820
ASAP. It's a simple

2222
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.577
reusable custom slash command.

2223
00:49:58.577 --> 00:49:59.836
If you remember inside

2224
00:49:59.836 --> 00:50:01.175
of the cloud directory
