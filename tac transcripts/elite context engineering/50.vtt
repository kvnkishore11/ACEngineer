1096
00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.678
scrape can consume quite

1097
00:25:00.817 --> 00:25:01.996
a bit of tokens.

1098
00:25:02.036 --> 00:25:02.694
And so we have

1099
00:25:02.694 --> 00:25:04.094
this load AI docs,

1100
00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:06.393
reusable agentic prompt that's

1101
00:25:06.393 --> 00:25:07.292
gonna kick this off.

1102
00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:07.971
You can see that

1103
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:08.892
the token's starting to

1104
00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:09.830
tick up. We already

1105
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.131
have 3K for each

1106
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:12.410
agent. This is 3K

1107
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.489
tokens times eight or

1108
00:25:14.489 --> 00:25:16.307
10 that isn't added

1109
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:18.067
to our primary agent.

1110
00:25:18.346 --> 00:25:20.766
This is sub-agent delegation.

1111
00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:21.945
We're leveraging the context

1112
00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:24.125
windows of our sub-agents

1113
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:25.243
to do work and

1114
00:25:25.243 --> 00:25:26.284
keep it out of

1115
00:25:26.284 --> 00:25:28.282
our primary agent. In

1116
00:25:28.282 --> 00:25:29.281
this case, this is

1117
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:30.261
a great use case
