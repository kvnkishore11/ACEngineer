375
00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.648
a claw.md or any

376
00:09:30.648 --> 00:09:32.346
similar auto loading memory

377
00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:33.626
file. While this seems

378
00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:34.907
convenient at first, it

379
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.427
creates problems as you

380
00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:38.105
scale your agentic coding

381
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.645
across different tasks. So

382
00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:42.046
what is context priming?

383
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:42.860
and why is it

384
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.480
superior to a memory

385
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.678
file? And why is

386
00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:47.397
it superior to claw.md?

387
00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:48.676
Let's first double click

388
00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:50.514
into claw.md. There's nothing

389
00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:52.253
inherently wrong with this

390
00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:53.870
file. Like most technology,

391
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.269
it's how it's used

392
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.428
that's the problem. If

393
00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:57.268
we boot up a

394
00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:58.527
new instance here, you

395
00:09:58.527 --> 00:09:59.806
can see right away
