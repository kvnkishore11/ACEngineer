engineering and talk about

682
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.688
controlling your output tokens.

683
00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:33.947
Output tokens are nearly

684
00:16:33.947 --> 00:16:36.447
always the most expensive

685
00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:37.826
part of your agent.

686
00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:39.065
Output tokens are priced

687
00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:40.864
anywhere from three to

688
00:16:40.864 --> 00:16:42.403
five X the price

689
00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:43.543
of your input tokens.

690
00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:44.902
That means one right

691
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:46.201
costs you up to

692
00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:47.900
five times more output

693
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:49.480
tokens burn your compute

694
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.619
and therefore burn a

695
00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:51.578
hole in your wallet

696
00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.437
fast. Thankfully, We can

697
00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:55.177
micromanage this just a

698
00:16:55.177 --> 00:16:56.716
little bit with output

699
00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:58.176
styles to limit and

700
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.034
specify the types of
