00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:30.625
context window of our

246
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.504
agents. Just for MCP

247
00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:34.884
servers, it's consuming 24K

248
00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:36.483
tokens. Let's round down,

249
00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:37.682
that's 10% of our

250
00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:40.101
entire 200K token context

251
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.322
window, chewing up expensive,

252
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.540
valuable Claude Opus tokens.

253
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.201
You might have a

254
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.339
model in the future,

255
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.720
regardless of your model,

256
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.439
context management is still

257
00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.658
critically important. 10K tokens

258
00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:54.177
is 5% of your

259
00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:55.641
entire 200K context window.

260
00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.262
This means 5% less

261
00:06:57.262 --> 00:06:58.321
work you can do

262
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.000
with this swing of
