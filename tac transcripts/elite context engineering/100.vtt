2224
00:49:59.836 --> 00:50:01.175
of the cloud directory

2225
00:50:01.175 --> 00:50:02.795
in our commands directory,

2226
00:50:02.795 --> 00:50:05.605
we have background.md. This

2227
00:50:05.605 --> 00:50:07.744
is a simple single

2228
00:50:07.744 --> 00:50:09.083
prompt that boots up

2229
00:50:09.143 --> 00:50:10.943
a background Claude Code

2230
00:50:10.943 --> 00:50:12.143
instance. This is the

2231
00:50:12.143 --> 00:50:14.121
simplest, quickest way, other

2232
00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:14.842
than going right through

2233
00:50:14.842 --> 00:50:16.521
the CLI, to delegate

2234
00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:18.260
work to agents. When

2235
00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.079
you use a pattern

2236
00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:20.539
like this, we're pushing

2237
00:50:20.539 --> 00:50:21.978
in to powerful Outloop

2238
00:50:21.978 --> 00:50:23.518
agent decoding by running

2239
00:50:23.518 --> 00:50:24.737
a single prompt with

2240
00:50:24.737 --> 00:50:25.876
a single agent that

2241
00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:27.556
does one thing, reports

2242
00:50:27.556 --> 00:50:28.715
its work, and then

2243
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.034
it finishes. So let
