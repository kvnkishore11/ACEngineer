1589
00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.057
your prompt or your

1590
00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.757
model, the context window

1591
00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:02.715
is the same. This

1592
00:36:02.715 --> 00:36:04.076
is also important for

1593
00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:05.815
Outloop agent decoding, right?

1594
00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:06.793
It prepares you for

1595
00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:08.172
Outloop agent decoding. And

1596
00:36:08.172 --> 00:36:08.913
for this to work

1597
00:36:09.012 --> 00:36:10.052
at high levels across

1598
00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:12.050
hundreds of agent executions,

1599
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.889
you need specialized agents

1600
00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:15.070
you know what the

1601
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.349
context will be if

1602
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:18.168
a compact command runs

1603
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:19.349
you can't know this

1604
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:20.768
with high confidence for

1605
00:36:20.768 --> 00:36:22.429
outloop agent decoding no

1606
00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:24.608
single agent should overflow

1607
00:36:24.688 --> 00:36:26.188
their 200k tokens and

1608
00:36:26.188 --> 00:36:27.608
trigger a compact if

1609
00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:28.648
it does you should

1610
00:36:28.648 --> 00:36:29.887
chop up the task

1611
00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.427
you shouldn't need slash
