WEBVTT

2319
00:51:58.364 --> 00:52:00.143
report file, okay? And

2320
00:52:00.143 --> 00:52:00.603
then we have this

2321
00:52:00.603 --> 00:52:02.762
primary agent delegation, XML

2322
00:52:02.762 --> 00:52:04.581
wrapper, where we're detailing

2323
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:05.501
a bunch of information

2324
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:06.380
for our agent, okay?

2325
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:07.541
We are kicking off

2326
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:09.000
a Claude Code instance

2327
00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:10.079
from Claude Code. We

2328
00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:12.059
have compute orchestrating compute,

2329
00:52:12.278 --> 00:52:14.536
agents orchestrating agents, okay?

2330
00:52:14.717 --> 00:52:15.996
This is where everything

2331
00:52:15.996 --> 00:52:17.635
is headed. Better agents

2332
00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:18.914
and then more agents.

2333
00:52:18.914 --> 00:52:19.755
Once you master a

2334
00:52:19.755 --> 00:52:20.934
single context window, you

2335
00:52:20.934 --> 00:52:22.034
can scale it up.

2336
00:52:22.094 --> 00:52:23.132
There's a format here,

2337
00:52:23.132 --> 00:52:23.813
blah, blah, blah, skip

2338
00:52:23.813 --> 00:52:24.413
to the bottom. But

2339
00:52:24.413 --> 00:52:25.273
the important thing here

2340
00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:26.351
is that this free

2341
00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.510
up the primary cloud

2342
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:28.311
code instance. You can

2343
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:28.610
see we have a

2344
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.168
background task, background cloud
