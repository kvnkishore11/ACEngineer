1228
00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:00.055
ready for sub-agents. You

1229
00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:00.775
probably want to spend

1230
00:28:00.775 --> 00:28:01.775
some more time cleaning

1231
00:28:01.775 --> 00:28:03.773
up, managing, and maintaining

1232
00:28:03.894 --> 00:28:05.532
clean context windows for

1233
00:28:05.532 --> 00:28:07.412
your existing single primary

1234
00:28:07.412 --> 00:28:08.211
agent. But once you're

1235
00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:09.490
ready, sub agents are

1236
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.250
a great intermediate level,

1237
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.588
a great intermediate technique

1238
00:28:12.588 --> 00:28:14.127
to step into because

1239
00:28:14.127 --> 00:28:15.327
you can delegate the

1240
00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:17.365
entire context window to

1241
00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:19.025
one or more sub

1242
00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:19.964
agents. As you saw

1243
00:28:19.984 --> 00:28:21.463
here, we say probably

1244
00:28:21.463 --> 00:28:23.903
40,000 total tokens and

1245
00:28:23.903 --> 00:28:25.122
ran all this work

1246
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:26.401
much faster than it

1247
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:27.240
would have taken a

1248
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.599
single primary agent. So

1249
00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:29.739
next up, we have

1250
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:32.317
a powerful classic pattern.
