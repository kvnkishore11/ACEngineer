1207
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.010
because of the flow

1208
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.030
of information. The flow

1209
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.070
of information in these

1210
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.210
multi-agent systems is critical.

1211
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.761
Your primary agent, is

1212
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:39.721
prompting your sub-agents and

1213
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:41.661
your sub-agents are responding

1214
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.880
not to you but

1215
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.420
back to your primary

1216
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.420
agent. So once we

1217
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.439
start getting into this

1218
00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:48.358
intermediate, advanced, and agentic

1219
00:27:48.358 --> 00:27:49.317
level, we have to

1220
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:50.998
keep track of every

1221
00:27:50.998 --> 00:27:52.696
agent's core four that

1222
00:27:52.696 --> 00:27:53.596
we spin up. If

1223
00:27:53.596 --> 00:27:54.196
you're losing track of

1224
00:27:54.196 --> 00:27:55.257
a single agent, right,

1225
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:55.655
and you have a

1226
00:27:55.655 --> 00:27:57.236
bunch of wasted context,

1227
00:27:57.296 --> 00:27:58.715
you probably aren't yet

1228
00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:00.055
ready for sub-agents. You
