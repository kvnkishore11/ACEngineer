2116
00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:30.193
100. Figure out what

2117
00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:31.172
Claude Code hooks are

2118
00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:32.713
available and their respective

2119
00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:34.371
input schemas from the

2120
00:47:34.371 --> 00:47:35.650
documentation. Okay. So I'm

2121
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.291
gonna fire this off.

2122
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:37.389
Here's that context bundle

2123
00:47:37.389 --> 00:47:38.130
running and you can

2124
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:38.929
see that same deal.

2125
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.289
There's all the response

2126
00:47:40.289 --> 00:47:41.907
formats for every hook

2127
00:47:41.987 --> 00:47:42.987
based on the existing

2128
00:47:42.987 --> 00:47:44.646
documentation and there's the

2129
00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:45.387
available hooks. But you

2130
00:47:45.387 --> 00:47:46.505
can see here again

2131
00:47:46.505 --> 00:47:47.365
in the context bundle,

2132
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:49.385
we're saving the actual

2133
00:47:49.385 --> 00:47:51.264
read executions and the

2134
00:47:51.264 --> 00:47:53.400
tool input. We've overwritten

2135
00:47:53.521 --> 00:47:55.557
the calling mechanism for

2136
00:47:55.577 --> 00:47:56.856
reading files. You can

2137
00:47:56.856 --> 00:47:57.875
see there that same

2138
00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:59.333
pattern, reading 100 at

2139
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:00.211
a time of the
