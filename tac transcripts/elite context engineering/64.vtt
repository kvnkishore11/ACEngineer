1404
00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.617
always go overboard. By

1405
00:32:00.617 --> 00:32:01.077
the end of your

1406
00:32:01.077 --> 00:32:01.958
planning phase, you should

1407
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:03.457
be deleting information that

1408
00:32:03.457 --> 00:32:04.217
isn't relevant to the

1409
00:32:04.217 --> 00:32:05.756
work you want done.

1410
00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:06.496
You should go overboard,

1411
00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:07.755
then delete. Here we

1412
00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:09.173
have the R&D framework

1413
00:32:09.173 --> 00:32:10.313
in full swing. We're

1414
00:32:10.313 --> 00:32:12.071
delegating across two agents

1415
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:13.832
to reduce context when

1416
00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:14.770
it matters most. There

1417
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.431
are a lot of

1418
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.450
places where it matters,

1419
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.190
but when your agent

1420
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.828
is actually writing the

1421
00:32:18.828 --> 00:32:20.127
code, when they're actually

1422
00:32:20.127 --> 00:32:21.567
running your agentic workflows,

1423
00:32:21.646 --> 00:32:22.727
that's when it matters

1424
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:23.846
the most. And this

1425
00:32:23.846 --> 00:32:25.345
context window here that's

1426
00:32:25.345 --> 00:32:26.325
doing all this writing,

1427
00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:27.604
right, chewing up our

1428
00:32:27.604 --> 00:32:29.702
expensive output tokens, it's

1429
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:31.554
a focused agent with
