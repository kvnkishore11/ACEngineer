2344
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.168
background task, background cloud

2345
00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:31.048
code kicked off. If

2346
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:31.907
we open this up,

2347
00:52:32.027 --> 00:52:32.987
this is the file

2348
00:52:32.987 --> 00:52:33.766
that our agent is

2349
00:52:33.766 --> 00:52:35.025
going to be reporting

2350
00:52:35.025 --> 00:52:35.945
to. And so cool

2351
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:37.063
thing here, we can

2352
00:52:37.063 --> 00:52:38.264
open up a context

2353
00:52:38.264 --> 00:52:39.402
bundle for this agent,

2354
00:52:39.402 --> 00:52:39.942
right? So if we

2355
00:52:39.942 --> 00:52:40.541
hit up here, you

2356
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:41.860
can see that exact

2357
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.000
prompt background slash quick

2358
00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:45.318
plan, read, blah, blah,

2359
00:52:45.318 --> 00:52:46.157
blah, blah, blah. This

2360
00:52:46.157 --> 00:52:47.257
agent is starting to

2361
00:52:47.257 --> 00:52:48.237
work, all right? It's

2362
00:52:48.257 --> 00:52:49.096
starting to create this

2363
00:52:49.096 --> 00:52:49.795
plan. And we can

2364
00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:50.835
see that with the

2365
00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:52.226
context bundle. You can

2366
00:52:52.226 --> 00:52:53.045
see this is super

2367
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.844
useful adding logging, having

2368
00:52:54.844 --> 00:52:56.684
these trails, there's the

2369
00:52:56.684 --> 00:52:57.784
actual plan just got

2370
00:52:57.784 --> 00:52:59.364
written there. Having this

2371
00:52:59.364 --> 00:53:01.003
trail, this story of
