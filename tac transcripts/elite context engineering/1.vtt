13
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.388
out and fix it.

14
00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:31.527
There are three levels

15
00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.246
of context engineering and

16
00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:34.686
a fourth hidden level

17
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.829
if you're on the

18
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.509
bleeding edge pushing into

19
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.387
agentic engineering. But first

20
00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:40.167
we have to ask,

21
00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:41.926
why are context engineering

22
00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.165
techniques so important? It's

23
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.704
because context engineering enables

24
00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:48.064
you to manage the

25
00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:50.563
precious and delicate resource

26
00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:51.921
that is the context

27
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.600
window of your agents

28
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.420
like Claude Code. There

29
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.740
are only two ways

30
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.698
to manage your context

31
00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.497
window, R and D.

32
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.149
Let's break down each
