458
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.159
problem with always on

459
00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:32.320
context is that It's

460
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.018
not dynamic or controllable.

461
00:11:34.077 --> 00:11:35.395
Engineering work inside of

462
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.693
codebases constantly changes,

463
00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:39.152
but the claw.md file

464
00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:40.929
only grows. Over time,

465
00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:41.610
as you and your

466
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.707
team add more information,

467
00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:43.528
the file grows and

468
00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.485
grows, and eventually it

469
00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.823
becomes bloated with context

470
00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:48.542
that isn't relevant to

471
00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.192
every engineering task, and

472
00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:50.611
this is the key.

473
00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:52.509
Eventually, it's not gonna

474
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:53.190
be relevant for the

475
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.009
work you're doing. It's

476
00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:55.028
going to have useless

477
00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:56.645
context in your precious

478
00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.065
context window, and in

479
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:58.943
the worst case, it's

480
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:01.902
gonna have contradictory information
