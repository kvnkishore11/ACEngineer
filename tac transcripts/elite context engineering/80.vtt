1777
00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:01.101
plus lines of reads

1778
00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:02.001
and writes. We can

1779
00:40:02.001 --> 00:40:03.699
use a context bundle

1780
00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:04.398
to get a much

1781
00:40:04.398 --> 00:40:05.978
more accurate replay of

1782
00:40:05.978 --> 00:40:06.838
what the previous agent

1783
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:07.396
was trying to do.

1784
00:40:07.396 --> 00:40:07.996
You can see here

1785
00:40:07.996 --> 00:40:09.016
in the summary message,

1786
00:40:09.056 --> 00:40:10.235
very concisely, the previous

1787
00:40:10.235 --> 00:40:11.634
agent executed this command

1788
00:40:11.693 --> 00:40:13.132
and loaded key findings.

1789
00:40:13.132 --> 00:40:14.492
That's it, nine files.

1790
00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.152
You can imagine this

1791
00:40:15.152 --> 00:40:15.851
getting a lot more

1792
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.730
complicated with reads, writes,

1793
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:19.248
and additional prompts, but

1794
00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:21.327
with this simple pattern,

1795
00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:23.166
with this session ID,

1796
00:40:23.297 --> 00:40:24.894
getting tracked here inside

1797
00:40:24.894 --> 00:40:25.833
of this context bundle.

1798
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:27.110
We're saving a concise

1799
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.628
execution log, thanks to

1800
00:40:28.628 --> 00:40:29.786
Claude Code Hooks that

1801
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.003
we can reference in
