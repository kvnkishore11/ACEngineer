700
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.034
specify the types of

701
00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:01.034
output you want Cloud

702
00:17:01.034 --> 00:17:02.474
Code to have and

703
00:17:02.474 --> 00:17:04.013
therefore the number of

704
00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:05.772
output tokens CloudCode will

705
00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:07.912
generate when responding. Now

706
00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:08.671
it's important to note

707
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.611
a lot of the

708
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.630
output tokens are chewed

709
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.529
up when you're actually

710
00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.088
writing and generating files

711
00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:14.088
and when CloudCode is

712
00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:16.147
returning large chunks back

713
00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:17.106
to you, there's not

714
00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:17.787
a lot you can

715
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:18.645
do about this, but

716
00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:20.066
we can control the

717
00:17:20.066 --> 00:17:22.384
responses CloudCode has directly

718
00:17:22.404 --> 00:17:22.903
to you. Now we

719
00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:24.243
can showcase that with

720
00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:25.782
a CloudCode settings file.

721
00:17:25.782 --> 00:17:27.422
So inside of our

722
00:17:27.554 --> 00:17:28.893
dot Claude directory here,

723
00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:30.011
we have settings dot
