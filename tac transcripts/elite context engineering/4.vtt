00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.051
to gain an awareness

69
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.248
of the state of

70
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.787
our agents inside of

71
00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.603
our agentic pipelines, inside

72
00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:07.421
of our ADWs. When

73
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:08.319
aligned with the right

74
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.117
model prompt pools and

75
00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:11.396
the right range of

76
00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:12.657
context, we can hit

77
00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:14.436
the core four bullseye

78
00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.794
over and over and

79
00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:17.873
over. This directly increases

80
00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:19.734
our agentic coding KPIs

81
00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:20.832
we break down in

82
00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:21.772
tech and our KPIs

83
00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:24.111
directly tell us if

84
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.491
we're improving our agentic

85
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.310
coding capabilities. Adding the

86
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.889
right context to your

87
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.030
agent is usually the
