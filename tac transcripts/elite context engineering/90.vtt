2000
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.543
read in increments of

2001
00:45:00.543 --> 00:45:02.704
100 lines for example

2002
00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:03.304
and then i give

2003
00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:04.623
an example being really

2004
00:45:04.623 --> 00:45:05.822
detailed with how to

2005
00:45:05.822 --> 00:45:07.503
call this tool exactly

2006
00:45:07.623 --> 00:45:08.103
and then if you

2007
00:45:08.103 --> 00:45:08.902
read enough to accomplish

2008
00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:10.023
the request a task

2009
00:45:10.023 --> 00:45:11.362
stop reading and proceed

2010
00:45:11.362 --> 00:45:12.061
with the task if

2011
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:12.922
you need more information

2012
00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:14.621
read another hundred lines

2013
00:45:14.722 --> 00:45:15.420
and determine if that's

2014
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.201
enough. And then we

2015
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:17.239
have one more instruction,

2016
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.759
important, we're tapping into

2017
00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:20.217
an information tense keyword.

2018
00:45:20.277 --> 00:45:21.518
When you respond to

2019
00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.097
the user with your

2020
00:45:22.097 --> 00:45:23.635
final message, always prefix

2021
00:45:23.675 --> 00:45:24.815
your last message with

2022
00:45:24.974 --> 00:45:26.353
check or X for

2023
00:45:26.353 --> 00:45:27.554
success or failure, all

2024
00:45:27.554 --> 00:45:28.813
right? And so this

2025
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.851
agent has been modified,
