2543
00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:00.179
something really special, something

2544
00:57:00.179 --> 00:57:01.378
really powerful. There's not

2545
00:57:01.378 --> 00:57:01.998
really a name for

2546
00:57:01.998 --> 00:57:02.699
this yet, but I've

2547
00:57:02.699 --> 00:57:03.858
been just blatantly calling

2548
00:57:03.858 --> 00:57:06.117
this pattern agent experts.

2549
00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:07.356
The idea is simple

2550
00:57:07.356 --> 00:57:08.936
and powerful, especially for

2551
00:57:08.936 --> 00:57:10.954
context engineering with agents

2552
00:57:10.974 --> 00:57:12.673
on large codebases.

2553
00:57:12.673 --> 00:57:13.592
Okay, this idea is

2554
00:57:13.612 --> 00:57:14.932
echoed inside of TAC

2555
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:16.391
with templates. You can

2556
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:18.311
use your agent delegation

2557
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:19.369
of choice. You can

2558
00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:20.228
use your primary agent,

2559
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:21.887
primary delegated agent, or

2560
00:57:21.887 --> 00:57:23.047
sub-agent. And the whole

2561
00:57:23.047 --> 00:57:23.606
idea is that you

2562
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.864
fire off specialized agents

2563
00:57:25.864 --> 00:57:27.623
that are experts at

2564
00:57:27.623 --> 00:57:29.300
specific parts of your

2565
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.380
codebase. And here's
