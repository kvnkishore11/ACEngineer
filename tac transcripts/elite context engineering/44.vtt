949
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:01.240
a concise done prompt.

950
00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:02.220
There are other versions

951
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.140
of this. You can

952
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.239
find some better middle

953
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.098
ground, but you can

954
00:22:05.098 --> 00:22:06.538
see very quickly how

955
00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:07.417
this is gonna stack

956
00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:08.077
up and this is

957
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:08.616
a great way to

958
00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:11.315
conserve your token usage.

959
00:22:11.355 --> 00:22:12.453
Now, it's also important

960
00:22:12.473 --> 00:22:13.012
to note here that

961
00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:14.291
output styles do something

962
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.970
interesting to the Cloud

963
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.048
Code instance you're running.

964
00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:19.186
It effectively swaps the

965
00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:20.958
output style block in

966
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.176
the system prompt, right?

967
00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:23.615
It hot swaps the

968
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:24.796
output style block in

969
00:22:24.796 --> 00:22:25.775
the system prompt of

970
00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:26.515
Claude Code. This is

971
00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:27.854
an interesting trend. Keep

972
00:22:27.854 --> 00:22:28.334
your eye on this.

973
00:22:28.334 --> 00:22:28.973
We're gonna talk about

974
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.593
the future of context
