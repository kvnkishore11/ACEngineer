WEBVTT

1679
00:37:59.634 --> 00:38:00.514
the work that happened

1680
00:38:00.514 --> 00:38:01.534
inside of our planner.

1681
00:38:01.826 --> 00:38:02.865
It read the file

1682
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:03.844
as specified and then

1683
00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:05.164
it wrote this plan

1684
00:38:05.164 --> 00:38:05.945
here for us, right?

1685
00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:07.324
And we have the

1686
00:38:07.324 --> 00:38:08.264
tool input and we

1687
00:38:08.264 --> 00:38:09.023
have a couple of

1688
00:38:09.023 --> 00:38:09.864
other things, right? This

1689
00:38:09.864 --> 00:38:10.704
is powerful. This is

1690
00:38:10.704 --> 00:38:12.123
a context bundle. What

1691
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.224
we have here is

1692
00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.762
a simple append only

1693
00:38:14.762 --> 00:38:16.143
log of the work

1694
00:38:16.302 --> 00:38:17.003
that our Claude Code

1695
00:38:17.043 --> 00:38:18.481
instances are doing. These

1696
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:19.362
are unique based on

1697
00:38:19.362 --> 00:38:20.534
the day and the

1698
00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:21.773
hour and the session

1699
00:38:21.773 --> 00:38:23.273
ID, okay? So how

1700
00:38:23.273 --> 00:38:24.152
does this work exactly?

1701
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:25.411
Fire up a YOLO

1702
00:38:25.492 --> 00:38:26.871
dangerous mode instance and

1703
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.789
we just type prime,

1704
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.929
right? Let's just rerun

1705
00:38:28.949 --> 00:38:29.630
a prime and let's

1706
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.309
prime our Claude Code,
