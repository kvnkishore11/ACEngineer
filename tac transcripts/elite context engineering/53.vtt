1163
00:26:29.803 --> 00:26:30.363
this. This is a

1164
00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:31.882
classic workflow we use

1165
00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.101
a lot throughout TAC

1166
00:26:33.101 --> 00:26:34.000
and throughout our extended

1167
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.939
lessons. So you can

1168
00:26:34.939 --> 00:26:35.919
see here all the

1169
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:37.597
tokens that were not

1170
00:26:37.617 --> 00:26:38.797
added to my primary

1171
00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.757
agents context window. We

1172
00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:40.676
can of course slash

1173
00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.936
context to prove that

1174
00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:43.276
we're only up to

1175
00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:44.996
9K tokens, okay? We

1176
00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:46.296
delegated work, right? We're

1177
00:26:46.296 --> 00:26:47.634
stepping into the D

1178
00:26:47.634 --> 00:26:48.414
in the R and

1179
00:26:48.434 --> 00:26:49.714
D framework. There's only

1180
00:26:49.714 --> 00:26:51.255
two ways to manage

1181
00:26:51.255 --> 00:26:52.534
your context window, reduce

1182
00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:54.416
context, entering your primary

1183
00:26:54.416 --> 00:26:56.336
agent and delegate context

1184
00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:57.815
to sub-agents and as

1185
00:26:57.815 --> 00:26:58.795
you'll see in upcoming

1186
00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:00.873
techniques to other primary
