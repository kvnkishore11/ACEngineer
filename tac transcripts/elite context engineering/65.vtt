1429
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:31.554
a focused agent with

1430
00:32:31.554 --> 00:32:33.311
a focused context window,

1431
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:34.490
and that means it

1432
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.910
is a performant agent.

1433
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.630
All right, and just

1434
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.449
to detail that prompt

1435
00:32:37.449 --> 00:32:38.208
a little bit more,

1436
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:39.487
if we run up

1437
00:32:39.487 --> 00:32:40.326
a little bit, here's

1438
00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.165
what this agent is

1439
00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:42.065
planning, just to give

1440
00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:42.505
a little bit of

1441
00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:43.903
more additional context here,

1442
00:32:43.923 --> 00:32:45.042
right? Quite simple, so

1443
00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:46.182
quick plan, and then

1444
00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:46.980
here's the prompt that

1445
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.440
we're actually executing. Read

1446
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.718
TypeScript SDK, create reusable,

1447
00:32:50.817 --> 00:32:51.997
three file wrapper system

1448
00:32:51.997 --> 00:32:53.116
for calling agents via

1449
00:32:53.116 --> 00:32:54.895
Claude Code, TypeScript SDK.

1450
00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:56.035
Here are some methods,

1451
00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:57.234
types file, low level,

1452
00:32:57.414 --> 00:32:58.814
CLI file, create this

1453
00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:00.074
in this directory. All
