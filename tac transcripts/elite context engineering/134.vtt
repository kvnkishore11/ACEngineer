3017
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.280
on the fly. It's

3018
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.519
dedicated, it's differentiated. We

3019
01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:02.980
don't want this to

3020
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.119
be in the workflow

3021
01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:05.320
or in the purpose

3022
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.900
or in the instructions.

3023
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:07.619
We have a dedicated

3024
01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:09.259
section built for this.

3025
01:07:09.338 --> 01:07:10.918
We're following great agentic

3026
01:07:10.918 --> 01:07:11.938
prompt engineering. We're not

3027
01:07:11.938 --> 01:07:14.378
conflating our headers. We're

3028
01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:15.737
not conflating our sections.

3029
01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:16.978
It's very important. And

3030
01:07:17.077 --> 01:07:18.518
this pattern, the agent

3031
01:07:18.518 --> 01:07:20.068
experts, It brings us

3032
01:07:20.068 --> 01:07:20.768
right back to the

3033
01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:22.065
highest leverage point of

3034
01:07:22.065 --> 01:07:23.824
agent decoding, the ADW,

3035
01:07:23.864 --> 01:07:26.380
the AI developer workflow.

3036
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.478
You can imagine a

3037
01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:28.976
workflow in ADW where

3038
01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:30.775
we string together these
