107
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.626
right now fits into

108
00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:01.765
one or both of

109
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.283
these buckets. Let's start

110
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.283
at the beginner level

111
00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.163
and move up to

112
00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:06.722
more technical levels of

113
00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:11.457
context engineering. Your agent's

114
00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.578
context window is a

115
00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:15.235
precious, renewable, but limited

116
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.093
temporal resource. What does

117
00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.234
that mean? The context

118
00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:19.253
window is ephemeral. It

119
00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:21.353
resets. It's alive for

120
00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:22.073
only a certain amount

121
00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:22.991
of time and the

122
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.271
state in your context

123
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.691
window is critical to

124
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.850
your success. Whenever you

125
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.751
have a resource that

126
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.449
determines your success, you

127
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.909
must measure it so
