3038
01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:30.775
we string together these

3039
01:07:30.815 --> 01:07:32.871
three prompts in three

3040
01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:35.380
individual agents. plan, build,

3041
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.400
pass the plan to

3042
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.380
the build, and then

3043
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.780
improve, and then we

3044
01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.838
run our git commits

3045
01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:40.998
after, right? This is

3046
01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:42.436
an entire workflow. All

3047
01:07:42.436 --> 01:07:43.317
we do is pass

3048
01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:44.615
in some prompt, a

3049
01:07:44.615 --> 01:07:45.496
high-level prompt that we

3050
01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:46.275
want, and then this

3051
01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:48.434
workflow, this specialized agent

3052
01:07:48.454 --> 01:07:49.293
takes it from there,

3053
01:07:49.373 --> 01:07:49.753
okay? There are many

3054
01:07:49.753 --> 01:07:51.072
directions to go with

3055
01:07:51.072 --> 01:07:52.472
this. You can imagine

3056
01:07:52.711 --> 01:07:54.371
a router agent that

3057
01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:55.829
takes in any high-level

3058
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:57.188
prompt and then determines

3059
01:07:57.188 --> 01:07:58.407
what expert to run.

3060
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.106
There are many ways
