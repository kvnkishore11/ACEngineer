127
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.909
must measure it so

128
00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:31.969
you can improve it.

129
00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.669
The context window is

130
00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.088
the single most important

131
00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:36.967
leverage point for effective

132
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.487
agentic coding. So how

133
00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:39.187
do we measure it?

134
00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:40.507
Inside of the elite

135
00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.425
context engineering codebase,

136
00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:43.485
we can break down

137
00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.649
how exactly we'll measure

138
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.109
our context in our

139
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.608
Claude Code agents. We

140
00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:50.526
have two primary modes

141
00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.725
of measuring context, context

142
00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:53.846
in our agent and

143
00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:55.365
context we might add

144
00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:56.344
to our agent. If

145
00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:56.783
we spin up a

146
00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.044
Claude Code instance, you

147
00:03:58.044 --> 00:03:58.663
can see here we

148
00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.082
have some context problems
