00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.908
Use slash context and

210
00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:33.127
install a tokenizer right

211
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:34.247
in your IDE so

212
00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:35.307
you know what's coming

213
00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:37.185
into your agent's context.

214
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.084
Do not load MCP

215
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.384
servers unless you need

216
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:45.403
them. Take a look

217
00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:46.124
at how much of

218
00:05:46.124 --> 00:05:48.084
my Claude Code Opus

219
00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:49.223
tokens are being chewed

220
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.963
up by MCP tools.

221
00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:54.141
24.1 thousand tokens. Okay,

222
00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:55.641
this is 12% of

223
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.901
the entire available context

224
00:05:57.901 --> 00:05:59.978
window, it's very likely
