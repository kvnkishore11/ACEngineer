WEBVTT

284
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.923
clears up our context

285
00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:31.523
window, okay? If we

286
00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:33.261
type Claude now context,

287
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.201
we've just saved some

288
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.459
20,000 tokens by not

289
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.737
preloading any MCP servers,

290
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.916
okay? Do not assume

291
00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:40.576
you need these. If

292
00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:41.615
you do need these,

293
00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:42.495
I recommend you fire

294
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.014
these up by hand.

295
00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:45.053
The cracked Claude Code

296
00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.494
team at Anthropic has

297
00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:47.692
a couple of quick,

298
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.451
simple, easy command line

299
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.351
flags you can use.

300
00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.591
Cloud dash dash MCP

301
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.550
config, and now you

302
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.689
just pass in the

303
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:54.410
config you want. So

304
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.110
let's say I just

305
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.509
wanted the Firecrawl MCP

306
00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.108
server. You can see

307
00:07:57.108 --> 00:07:58.348
I have this specialized

308
00:07:58.348 --> 00:07:59.747
file here that pulls

309
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:01.206
in just the Firecrawl
