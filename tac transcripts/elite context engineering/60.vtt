00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.538
continuing to reduce context

1318
00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:03.250
windows and delegate work

1319
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.388
between agents. The idea

1320
00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:07.308
here is simple. Separate

1321
00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.748
your agents responsibilities. Why?

1322
00:30:09.768 --> 00:30:11.326
Because especially for your

1323
00:30:11.326 --> 00:30:13.047
implementer, AKA your editor

1324
00:30:13.067 --> 00:30:14.326
and builder agent, you

1325
00:30:14.326 --> 00:30:16.546
want their context focused

1326
00:30:16.546 --> 00:30:17.105
so they can make

1327
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.825
surgical perfect error free

1328
00:30:19.825 --> 00:30:20.924
edits. A lot of

1329
00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:22.644
engineers are stacking up

1330
00:30:22.644 --> 00:30:23.943
a chat window. They're

1331
00:30:23.943 --> 00:30:26.042
prompt chaining inside of

1332
00:30:26.042 --> 00:30:27.163
a single agents chat

1333
00:30:27.163 --> 00:30:28.042
window over and over

1334
00:30:28.042 --> 00:30:28.821
and over. And they're

1335
00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:30.193
not realizing that they're
