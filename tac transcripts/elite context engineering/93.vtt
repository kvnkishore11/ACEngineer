2071
00:46:29.338 --> 00:46:30.976
super, super powerful. We've

2072
00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:32.576
just reduced the number

2073
00:46:32.576 --> 00:46:33.815
of lines our agent

2074
00:46:33.815 --> 00:46:34.855
had to read with

2075
00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:35.974
the read tool, okay?

2076
00:46:35.974 --> 00:46:37.233
And we forced Cloud

2077
00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:38.914
Code to increment. This

2078
00:46:38.914 --> 00:46:40.092
is super powerful. And

2079
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.112
this is just one

2080
00:46:41.112 --> 00:46:42.771
simple way, one simple

2081
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:45.248
control mechanism for steering

2082
00:46:45.268 --> 00:46:46.009
this agent in a

2083
00:46:46.009 --> 00:46:47.987
completely different direction. You

2084
00:46:47.987 --> 00:46:49.007
can push this even

2085
00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:50.746
further using the Cloud

2086
00:46:50.746 --> 00:46:52.405
Code SDK. In addition

2087
00:46:52.405 --> 00:46:53.764
to the append system

2088
00:46:53.764 --> 00:46:54.842
prompt command, there is

2089
00:46:54.842 --> 00:46:57.541
also a SDK specific

2090
00:46:57.641 --> 00:46:59.978
custom system prompt variable

2091
00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:00.458
that you can pass
