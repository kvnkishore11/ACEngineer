903
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.650
tokens, okay? Not too

904
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.989
bad, right? Now, if

905
00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:02.327
we open up a

906
00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:03.547
new file and copy

907
00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:04.986
done, all right, let's

908
00:21:04.986 --> 00:21:06.125
copy just done. And

909
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:07.124
we'll actually put this

910
00:21:07.124 --> 00:21:07.982
on the left and

911
00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:09.061
we'll put this on

912
00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:09.861
the right. You can

913
00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:10.760
see here we have

914
00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:13.438
two tokens, all right?

915
00:21:14.082 --> 00:21:14.961
So it's not the

916
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:15.901
fact that this is

917
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:16.661
a ton of tokens,

918
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.500
it's not, but it's

919
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.539
the fact that this

920
00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:19.898
is two tokens and

921
00:21:19.898 --> 00:21:22.157
this is 150 tokens.

922
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.538
When we're running Outlook

923
00:21:23.557 --> 00:21:24.356
agents, as we start

924
00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:24.936
to get out the

925
00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:25.816
loop, we don't need

926
00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.655
to be chewing up

927
00:21:26.695 --> 00:21:29.234
this 150 extra tokens

928
00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:31.034
across tens of prompts,
