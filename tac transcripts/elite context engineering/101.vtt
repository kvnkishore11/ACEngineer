WEBVTT

2243
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.034
it finishes. So let

2244
00:50:30.034 --> 00:50:30.574
me show you exactly

2245
00:50:30.574 --> 00:50:31.135
what I mean. I'll

2246
00:50:31.135 --> 00:50:32.833
run Claude Opus in

2247
00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:33.713
Yolo mode here, and

2248
00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:34.773
then I'll say slash

2249
00:50:34.833 --> 00:50:35.813
background. And you can

2250
00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:36.672
see here, this fires

2251
00:50:36.672 --> 00:50:37.891
off a full Claude

2252
00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:39.070
code instance in the

2253
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.490
background. Here's our argument

2254
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.269
hint, prompt model report

2255
00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.248
file. I wanna kick

2256
00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:44.068
off the creation of

2257
00:50:44.068 --> 00:50:45.208
a plan. There's no

2258
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:46.327
reason for me to

2259
00:50:46.507 --> 00:50:47.487
sit here in the

2260
00:50:47.487 --> 00:50:48.547
loop prompting back and

2261
00:50:48.547 --> 00:50:49.505
forth when I can

2262
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.606
kick off a background

2263
00:50:50.606 --> 00:50:51.264
agent, when I can

2264
00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:52.965
delegate this work outside

2265
00:50:52.965 --> 00:50:54.184
of my primary agent's

2266
00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.563
content context window, right?

2267
00:50:55.563 --> 00:50:56.623
We're delegating this work

2268
00:50:56.643 --> 00:50:57.961
out. I can open

2269
00:50:57.961 --> 00:50:58.920
up some quotes here,

2270
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.159
paste this in, and
