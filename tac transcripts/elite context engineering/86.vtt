1910
00:43:00.246 --> 00:43:01.965
Now we've reached the

1911
00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:03.666
agentic level. Here you've

1912
00:43:03.666 --> 00:43:04.764
mastered all the previous

1913
00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:06.083
levels of context engineering.

1914
00:43:06.164 --> 00:43:07.364
This is where things

1915
00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:09.362
get powerful and dangerous

1916
00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:09.922
if you don't know

1917
00:43:09.922 --> 00:43:11.121
what you're doing because

1918
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.641
your patterns will start

1919
00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.280
to scale into the

1920
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.659
agentic workflows, into the

1921
00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:17.219
ADWs, into the pipelines

1922
00:43:17.398 --> 00:43:18.998
that you built. Okay.

1923
00:43:18.998 --> 00:43:20.070
So let's focus on

1924
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.768
the system prompt. You

1925
00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:23.907
can massively control Claude

1926
00:43:23.907 --> 00:43:25.226
Code's behavior and really

1927
00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:27.005
any agent's behavior. This

1928
00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:28.824
can completely change how

1929
00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.163
the tool works even
