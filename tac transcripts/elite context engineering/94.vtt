2091
00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:00.458
that you can pass

2092
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:01.938
into the SDK. Do

2093
00:47:01.938 --> 00:47:03.456
not use that unless

2094
00:47:03.456 --> 00:47:03.876
you know what you're

2095
00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:04.856
doing. The Claude Code

2096
00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:05.556
team has put a

2097
00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.594
ton of work into

2098
00:47:06.594 --> 00:47:08.253
crafting the system prompt

2099
00:47:08.514 --> 00:47:09.552
be a top tier

2100
00:47:09.552 --> 00:47:10.811
agent for engineering. If

2101
00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:12.192
you use, I think

2102
00:47:12.192 --> 00:47:13.550
it's called a custom

2103
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.869
system prompt, I'll of

2104
00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:15.668
course link all the

2105
00:47:15.668 --> 00:47:17.288
documentation below in your

2106
00:47:17.288 --> 00:47:18.307
loot box. But if

2107
00:47:18.307 --> 00:47:19.286
you use this variable,

2108
00:47:19.286 --> 00:47:20.806
you will blow away

2109
00:47:21.057 --> 00:47:22.237
the system prompt, use

2110
00:47:22.237 --> 00:47:23.637
this with caution. Okay.

2111
00:47:23.637 --> 00:47:24.456
And so we can

2112
00:47:24.456 --> 00:47:25.295
run another one. So

2113
00:47:25.295 --> 00:47:26.076
we have another prompt

2114
00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.275
here, same deal. We're

2115
00:47:27.275 --> 00:47:28.414
reading in chunks of

2116
00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:30.193
100. Figure out what
