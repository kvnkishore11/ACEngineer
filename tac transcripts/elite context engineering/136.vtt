3060
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.106
There are many ways

3061
01:08:00.106 --> 01:08:01.266
and directions to take

3062
01:08:01.266 --> 01:08:01.706
this, but I wanna

3063
01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:02.905
leave that up to

3064
01:08:02.905 --> 01:08:04.324
you, take these 12

3065
01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:06.242
techniques and apply them,

3066
01:08:06.442 --> 01:08:07.400
get value out of

3067
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.639
these techniques. All right,

3068
01:08:08.798 --> 01:08:09.438
yes, it takes some

3069
01:08:09.438 --> 01:08:10.197
time. Yes, you have

3070
01:08:10.197 --> 01:08:11.496
to invest. This is

3071
01:08:11.496 --> 01:08:13.094
not vibe coding, okay?

3072
01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:14.811
If it's easy, a

3073
01:08:14.851 --> 01:08:15.791
vibe coder is probably

3074
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:16.689
doing it and that

3075
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:18.787
isn't irreplaceable, okay? That

3076
01:08:18.787 --> 01:08:20.886
is replaceable work. Even

3077
01:08:20.886 --> 01:08:21.445
one of these can

3078
01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:22.604
save you massive time,

3079
01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.545
but you have 12

3080
01:08:23.545 --> 01:08:24.703
here. Pick one, pick

3081
01:08:24.703 --> 01:08:25.923
a couple, dive into

3082
01:08:25.923 --> 01:08:27.162
them, deploy it into

3083
01:08:27.162 --> 01:08:28.023
your agentic coding to

3084
01:08:28.023 --> 01:08:29.902
improve your context engineering.
