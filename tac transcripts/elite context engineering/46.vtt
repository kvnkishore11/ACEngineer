995
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.349
type context in an

996
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:02.569
agent, a brand new

997
00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:03.489
agent, you'll notice something

998
00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:04.828
really interesting. We have

999
00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:06.167
custom agents here. All

1000
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:06.728
right, we have three

1001
00:23:06.728 --> 00:23:07.548
custom agents that we

1002
00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:08.386
can use at any

1003
00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:09.287
point in time. We

1004
00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:10.487
can, of course, find

1005
00:23:10.487 --> 00:23:11.625
these inside of Cloud

1006
00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:12.690
Code. Under the agents

1007
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.969
directory, we can look

1008
00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:14.468
at any one of

1009
00:23:14.468 --> 00:23:15.268
these, right? Now you'll

1010
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.686
notice something quite interesting.

1011
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:17.426
All of our agents

1012
00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:18.726
here, our custom agents

1013
00:23:18.726 --> 00:23:21.144
only consume 122 tokens.

1014
00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:22.063
Whereas you can see

1015
00:23:22.063 --> 00:23:24.061
my rough token counter

1016
00:23:24.122 --> 00:23:25.401
is looking at 900

1017
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:26.201
for this one agent.

1018
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:27.400
What's going on here?

1019
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.798
What's the big difference?

1020
00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:29.478
The big difference here

1021
00:23:29.478 --> 00:23:30.278
is that when you're
