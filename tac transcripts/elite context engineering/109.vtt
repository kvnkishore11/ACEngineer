00:54:29.322 --> 00:54:31.442
them. Don't take my

2442
00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:33.021
word for this. Ignore

2443
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:33.922
me as well, but

2444
00:54:34.001 --> 00:54:36.141
investigate the optimist in

2445
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:36.940
the space. See what

2446
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.641
they can really do.

2447
00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.239
See what we're really

2448
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:40.920
doing here. We have

2449
00:54:41.079 --> 00:54:43.438
background, compute, agents calling

2450
00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:44.318
agents. We have the

2451
00:54:44.458 --> 00:54:47.038
R&D framework, 12 context

2452
00:54:47.038 --> 00:54:48.217
engineering techniques. These are

2453
00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.556
concrete things. Maybe a

2454
00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:50.396
couple of these techniques

2455
00:54:50.396 --> 00:54:51.056
fly over your head

2456
00:54:51.056 --> 00:54:52.157
or you're not interested

2457
00:54:52.157 --> 00:54:52.516
or you think it

2458
00:54:52.516 --> 00:54:53.135
doesn't apply to you.

2459
00:54:53.135 --> 00:54:54.655
That's fine. Just take

2460
00:54:54.655 --> 00:54:55.295
one. a couple of

2461
00:54:55.295 --> 00:54:56.695
these and improve your

2462
00:54:56.695 --> 00:54:59.253
context engineering. The background

2463
00:54:59.293 --> 00:55:01.233
agent task and multi-agent
