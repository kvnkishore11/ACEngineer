660
00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.644
focus for your agents.

661
00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:01.965
And if you find

662
00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:03.283
yourself coming back to

663
00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:04.643
some specific area of

664
00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:06.282
focus, build out a

665
00:16:06.282 --> 00:16:07.581
prime command for that

666
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.840
specific area of focus

667
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.899
for you and your

668
00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:10.778
team. This is the

669
00:16:10.778 --> 00:16:12.118
beginning of a big

670
00:16:12.118 --> 00:16:14.157
agentic level technique that

671
00:16:14.157 --> 00:16:15.015
we're gonna talk about

672
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.254
in this lesson. You

673
00:16:16.254 --> 00:16:16.794
can see we have

674
00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:19.452
this new experts directory.

675
00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:19.932
We'll talk about that

676
00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:20.472
at the end of

677
00:16:20.472 --> 00:16:21.792
this lesson. So now

678
00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.390
we enter the intermediate

679
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.048
zone. Let's enter the

680
00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:29.006
intermediate zone of context

681
00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:30.206
engineering and talk about
