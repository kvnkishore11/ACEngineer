800
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.038
can see there's no

801
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.239
difference in token usage

802
00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:02.578
yet. In fact, our

803
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:03.817
concise agent has actually

804
00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:04.397
spent a few more

805
00:19:04.397 --> 00:19:05.917
tokens reading in and

806
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:06.856
looking for files. Okay,

807
00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:08.096
let's keep pushing this

808
00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:08.715
and get out of

809
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.016
the non-deterministic nature, right?

810
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:11.414
Let's find the average

811
00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:11.875
here. Okay, I'm gonna

812
00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:12.874
fire this off here

813
00:19:13.134 --> 00:19:14.013
and I'm gonna fire

814
00:19:14.013 --> 00:19:15.413
this off here, okay?

815
00:19:15.413 --> 00:19:16.093
And so what we're

816
00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:16.573
doing here is we're

817
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.071
reading some documentation in

818
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:19.090
AI docs. We can

819
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.730
pull this up right

820
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.090
here. It's Claude Code,

821
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.868
TypeScript SDK documentation, and

822
00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:24.608
we're letting our agents

823
00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:25.647
just kick off and

824
00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:26.647
run side by side,

825
00:19:26.827 --> 00:19:27.407
all right? And the

826
00:19:27.407 --> 00:19:28.686
important thing to pay

827
00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:29.905
attention to here is

828
00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.144
the response of our
