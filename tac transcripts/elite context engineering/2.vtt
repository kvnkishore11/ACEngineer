00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.149
Let's break down each

33
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.908
technique at each level

34
00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:04.087
and use the R&D

35
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.206
framework to maximize not

36
00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:07.025
what you can do,

37
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:08.203
but what your agents

38
00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:12.840
can do for you.

39
00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.778
A huge focus in

40
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:16.438
TAC is scaling up

41
00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:17.637
the intelligence we can

42
00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.115
deploy both in the

43
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.275
loop and out the

44
00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:21.674
loop. But with every

45
00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:22.873
agent we create, we

46
00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:24.930
must adopt their perspective

47
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.870
to maximize their impact

48
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.030
context is a critical

49
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.868
in-agent leverage point that
