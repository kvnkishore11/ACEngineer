WEBVTT

723
00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:30.011
we have settings dot

724
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:31.631
local dot concise. All

725
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:32.050
right, so I'm gonna

726
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.750
copy the path to

727
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.589
this and you can

728
00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:34.788
see it has an

729
00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.567
output style specified, okay?

730
00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.007
It has a one

731
00:17:38.007 --> 00:17:39.746
word output style, right?

732
00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:40.265
So let's see how

733
00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:41.105
powerful this can be.

734
00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:42.604
Claude in Yolo mode

735
00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:44.561
with Sonnet, specify a

736
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.080
settings file right here

737
00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:46.941
and kick this off.

738
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.759
Now we'll just type

739
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.500
something simple here, we'll

740
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.499
just say hi and

741
00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:50.239
then we'll open up

742
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:51.417
another terminal side by

743
00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:52.757
side and type Claude.

744
00:17:52.757 --> 00:17:53.556
So you can see

745
00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:56.913
here our agent just

746
00:17:56.913 --> 00:17:58.554
said done. Okay, so

747
00:17:58.554 --> 00:17:59.753
it's not interested in

748
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:00.553
talking to us. It's
