2295
00:51:28.432 --> 00:51:30.190
agent. Okay. And so

2296
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:30.690
you can see our

2297
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.650
primary agent getting to

2298
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.708
work here based on

2299
00:51:32.708 --> 00:51:33.869
the contents of this

2300
00:51:33.869 --> 00:51:34.788
prompt. We can of

2301
00:51:34.788 --> 00:51:36.027
course see that, you

2302
00:51:36.027 --> 00:51:38.025
know, consistent prompt format

2303
00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:39.583
where you're reusing great

2304
00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:40.684
prompt structures that get

2305
00:51:40.684 --> 00:51:41.603
work done for us.

2306
00:51:41.603 --> 00:51:43.141
Again, check out, the

2307
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.340
agentic prompt engineering, agentic

2308
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.239
horizon extended lesson to

2309
00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:47.838
learn how to write

2310
00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.077
great prompts for the

2311
00:51:49.077 --> 00:51:50.297
age of agents. And

2312
00:51:50.297 --> 00:51:51.157
it's all inside of

2313
00:51:51.157 --> 00:51:52.416
the workflow step here,

2314
00:51:52.456 --> 00:51:53.536
right? So create the

2315
00:51:53.536 --> 00:51:54.914
agents background directory. We

2316
00:51:54.914 --> 00:51:56.253
have our default values.

2317
00:51:56.385 --> 00:51:56.885
And then this is

2318
00:51:56.885 --> 00:51:58.364
important, we're creating a

2319
00:51:58.364 --> 00:52:00.143
report file, okay? And
