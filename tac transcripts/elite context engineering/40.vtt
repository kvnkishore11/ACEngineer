851
00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:00.761
clock code output style

852
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:02.301
to just say done

853
00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:03.648
There are of course

854
00:20:03.648 --> 00:20:04.807
a couple exceptions to

855
00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:06.127
this. We don't always

856
00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:07.166
just want a point

857
00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:09.085
blank done response. If

858
00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:09.805
we ask our agent

859
00:20:09.805 --> 00:20:11.104
a question or something

860
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:12.303
goes wrong, we of

861
00:20:12.303 --> 00:20:12.863
course want a more

862
00:20:12.883 --> 00:20:14.622
written out response. But

863
00:20:14.642 --> 00:20:15.240
most of the time

864
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.901
when our agent is

865
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:17.339
shipping work successfully, all

866
00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:17.898
it needs to do

867
00:20:17.898 --> 00:20:19.398
is respond with done,

868
00:20:19.478 --> 00:20:20.258
which is what we're

869
00:20:20.258 --> 00:20:20.916
gonna see here in

870
00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:21.856
just a second. So

871
00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:22.516
you can see on

872
00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:23.755
the right side, our

873
00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:25.015
agent has completed and

874
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.673
it's reported these output

875
00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:27.792
tokens to us here.

876
00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:28.352
And on the left

877
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.551
side here, when our

878
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.830
agent finishes, it's going
