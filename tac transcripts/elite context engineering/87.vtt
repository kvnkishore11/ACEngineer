1929
00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.163
the tool works even

1930
00:43:30.163 --> 00:43:31.182
more than Output Styles

1931
00:43:31.182 --> 00:43:32.782
because we can control

1932
00:43:32.782 --> 00:43:34.601
and start to overwrite

1933
00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:35.900
the default Claude Code

1934
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.938
behavior. I'll say it

1935
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.577
point blank, many engineers

1936
00:43:38.617 --> 00:43:39.217
will not get to

1937
00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:40.237
this level. Many engineers

1938
00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:42.115
don't need this level,

1939
00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:42.835
okay? But if you're

1940
00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:43.855
pushing to the edge,

1941
00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:45.173
the system prompt gives

1942
00:43:45.173 --> 00:43:47.257
you even more control

1943
00:43:47.356 --> 00:43:48.996
over your agent and

1944
00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:51.074
therefore the context flowing

1945
00:43:51.074 --> 00:43:52.452
in and out of

1946
00:43:52.452 --> 00:43:53.253
your agent. If you

1947
00:43:53.253 --> 00:43:53.972
start down the path

1948
00:43:53.972 --> 00:43:55.090
of agentic engineering, at

1949
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.210
some point, you will

1950
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.329
need to crack open

1951
00:43:57.329 --> 00:43:59.108
and modify the system

1952
00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:00.128
prompt. This is how
