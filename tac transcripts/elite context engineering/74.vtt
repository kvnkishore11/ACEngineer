1632
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:01.152
scale your agents, monitoring

1633
00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.652
and managing the state

1634
00:37:02.652 --> 00:37:03.751
of your context window

1635
00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:04.971
is critical for your

1636
00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:06.471
success, all right? Just

1637
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:07.730
like context priming, you

1638
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.989
can push in loop

1639
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.320
active context management even

1640
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.699
further with context bundles.

1641
00:37:13.818 --> 00:37:15.038
Okay. So with Cloud

1642
00:37:15.038 --> 00:37:16.117
Code hooks, you can

1643
00:37:16.117 --> 00:37:17.376
hook into a couple

1644
00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:18.496
of tool calls to

1645
00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:20.135
create a trail of

1646
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.175
work that you can

1647
00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:23.072
use to reprime your

1648
00:37:23.072 --> 00:37:24.371
agents for the next

1649
00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:24.972
run, right? So you

1650
00:37:24.972 --> 00:37:26.291
can chain together agents

1651
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:27.710
after the context window

1652
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.168
has exploded. So the

1653
00:37:29.168 --> 00:37:29.969
great part here is

1654
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:31.007
we've been using context
