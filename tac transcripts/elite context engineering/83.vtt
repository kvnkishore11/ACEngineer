1847
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:30.534
you've picked up on

1848
00:41:30.534 --> 00:41:31.335
this with some of

1849
00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:32.454
the repeat themes that

1850
00:41:32.454 --> 00:41:33.434
we're getting into, but

1851
00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:34.554
there's no better way

1852
00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:35.853
to control and manage

1853
00:41:35.853 --> 00:41:37.333
your context window than

1854
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:39.052
to ship one thing

1855
00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:39.911
at a time. A

1856
00:41:39.911 --> 00:41:41.152
focus agent is a

1857
00:41:41.152 --> 00:41:43.271
performant agent. This advanced

1858
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:44.670
technique forces you to

1859
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.289
sit down and answer

1860
00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:47.829
the question, what does

1861
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:49.070
the pipeline of agents

1862
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.489
look like for this

1863
00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:51.889
work? Okay. Once you

1864
00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:52.989
start doing this well,

1865
00:41:53.009 --> 00:41:54.148
and you understand the

1866
00:41:54.148 --> 00:41:55.228
idea of using one

1867
00:41:55.228 --> 00:41:56.548
agent for one purpose,

1868
00:41:56.548 --> 00:41:57.708
if you've taken tack

1869
00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:58.987
lesson six, you know

1870
00:41:58.987 --> 00:42:00.007
the full version of
