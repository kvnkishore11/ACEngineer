WEBVTT

2896
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.371
have this feature built

2897
01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:33.032
out exactly as specified.

2898
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:33.911
Okay, so there's the

2899
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.610
start session JSONL. We

2900
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:36.510
can type hi, we're

2901
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.668
gonna get whatever the

2902
01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:38.929
user prompts submit, and

2903
01:04:38.929 --> 01:04:39.329
then we're gonna get

2904
01:04:39.329 --> 01:04:40.527
some flows coming in.

2905
01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:41.547
ahead and run, right?

2906
01:04:41.547 --> 01:04:42.007
We got a stop

2907
01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:43.067
command. Let's go ahead

2908
01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:43.967
and run prime. This

2909
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:44.547
is going to run

2910
01:04:44.586 --> 01:04:46.326
a series of operations,

2911
01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:46.846
right? Let's go ahead

2912
01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:47.405
and kick that off.

2913
01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:47.945
And then you're going

2914
01:04:47.945 --> 01:04:48.826
to see the logs

2915
01:04:48.826 --> 01:04:49.985
come in. That was

2916
01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:51.184
built perfectly in one

2917
01:04:51.184 --> 01:04:52.525
shot with a planner

2918
01:04:52.525 --> 01:04:53.643
and a builder as

2919
01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:54.983
an expert, right? These

2920
01:04:54.983 --> 01:04:56.324
are agent experts. Let's

2921
01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:57.184
run the final step

2922
01:04:57.322 --> 01:04:58.402
and let's talk about

2923
01:04:58.402 --> 01:04:59.422
the future of context

2924
01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:00.682
engineering. Okay. So we're
