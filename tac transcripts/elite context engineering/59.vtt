1293
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.598
small reusable codebase

1294
00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:32.897
inside of our application

1295
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:34.316
layer. So app slash

1296
00:29:34.316 --> 00:29:36.055
CCTS wrapper. Okay, so

1297
00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:36.714
let's fire that off

1298
00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:38.457
this agent. is only

1299
00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:39.576
going to plan. And

1300
00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:40.115
now, as you can

1301
00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:41.275
imagine, if our agent

1302
00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:41.973
on the left is

1303
00:29:41.973 --> 00:29:43.133
only planning, we have

1304
00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:44.771
a completely free context

1305
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:45.691
window on the right

1306
00:29:45.711 --> 00:29:47.190
to build. Okay. And

1307
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.690
so we of course

1308
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.989
have slash build. We

1309
00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:49.907
can then take this

1310
00:29:49.907 --> 00:29:51.986
build command and execute

1311
00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:53.285
it on the plan

1312
00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:54.763
generated by our plan

1313
00:29:54.824 --> 00:29:55.702
agent. So we're going

1314
00:29:55.702 --> 00:29:56.602
to let this agent

1315
00:29:56.602 --> 00:29:57.901
cook. And as you

1316
00:29:57.901 --> 00:29:58.840
can see, we are

1317
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.538
continuing to reduce context
