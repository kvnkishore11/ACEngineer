1621
00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.634
just walk through these

1622
00:34:30.673 --> 00:34:32.353
and really understand what

1623
00:34:32.353 --> 00:34:33.112
these mean. This is

1624
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:34.532
how we know we're

1625
00:34:34.532 --> 00:34:35.690
improving, right? It's not

1626
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.690
enough to vibe code

1627
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.949
to randomly ship a

1628
00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.168
feature. That's cool. That's

1629
00:34:39.168 --> 00:34:40.248
table stakes, right? That's,

1630
00:34:40.268 --> 00:34:41.168
that's the low hanging

1631
00:34:41.168 --> 00:34:41.867
fruit. We need to

1632
00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:43.327
know we're improving. We

1633
00:34:43.327 --> 00:34:44.677
need metrics. Right? If

1634
00:34:44.677 --> 00:34:45.416
you don't measure it,

1635
00:34:45.597 --> 00:34:46.556
you can't improve it.

1636
00:34:46.556 --> 00:34:47.376
So we want to

1637
00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:49.253
increase size. We want

1638
00:34:49.273 --> 00:34:50.913
to decrease attempts. We

1639
00:34:50.913 --> 00:34:51.931
want to increase our

1640
00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:53.090
streak and we want

1641
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.889
to decrease our presence.

1642
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.289
These four make up

1643
00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:59.106
your Agentic Coding KPIs.

1644
00:34:59.487 --> 00:35:00.326
At the first level,
