00:46:29.585 --> 00:46:31.146
because they're so powerful,

2173
00:46:31.346 --> 00:46:32.766
they deserve their own

2174
00:46:32.929 --> 00:46:34.269
lesson and notice how

2175
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.989
some of the leverage

2176
00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:36.748
points are the node

2177
00:46:36.869 --> 00:46:37.929
in the software developer

2178
00:46:37.929 --> 00:46:39.467
lifecycle. Okay. In lesson

2179
00:46:39.487 --> 00:46:40.588
three, we'll focus our

2180
00:46:40.588 --> 00:46:41.507
attention on one of

2181
00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:42.527
the most powerful leverage

2182
00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:44.126

2185
00:46:46.527 --> 00:46:47.786
order prompts and we'll

2186
00:46:47.786 --> 00:46:49.286
build reusable plans that

2187
00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:50.757
you're agent can use

level prompt into low

2190
00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:55.735
level accurate codebase

2191
00:46:55.795 --> 00:46:57.414
details that will increase

2192
00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.793
