00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:01.011
deliver on engineering work.

977
00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:02.630
Okay. Now let's talk

978
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.557
about a really important

979
00:21:04.557 --> 00:21:06.516
leverage point architecture. Code-based

980
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.174
architecture is a critical

981
00:21:08.194 --> 00:21:09.374
leverage point for agentic

982
00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:10.113
coding. Let me give

983
00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:11.173
you a dead simple

984
00:21:11.173 --> 00:21:12.592
example to showcase this.

985
00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:14.050
Inside of this application,

986
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.029
if you open app,

987
00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:16.148
we have an architectural

988
00:21:16.148 --> 00:21:17.867
decision that cuts all

989
00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:19.326
possibilities in half for

990
00:21:19.326 --> 00:21:20.247
our agent. Can you

991
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:21.326
guess what it is?

992
00:21:21.465 --> 00:21:22.525
It's looking right at

993
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:24.044
us, right? Client and

994
00:21:24.104 --> 00:21:25.403
server. Because we have

995
00:21:25.403 --> 00:21:26.961
these separated, this one

996
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:28.601
simple decision makes it

997
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.779
easy for our agent

998
00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:30.640
to cut all of
