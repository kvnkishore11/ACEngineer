1165
00:24:59.713 --> 00:25:02.651
avoid large file sizes.

1166
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:03.191
I like the limit

1167
00:25:03.191 --> 00:25:05.128
of 1000 lines as

1168
00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:06.088
a loose, you know,

1169
00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:07.527
good max file size

1170
00:25:07.527 --> 00:25:08.406
to have great code

1171
00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.826
based architecture. You want

1172
00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:10.704
to have these markdown

1173
00:25:10.704 --> 00:25:12.544
files, right? These read

1174
00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.702
me's or these Claude.mds,

1175
00:25:14.702 --> 00:25:16.162
whatever the agent specific

1176
00:25:16.162 --> 00:25:17.682
documentation file is. You

1177
00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:18.421
want to have that

1178
00:25:18.421 --> 00:25:19.401
spread throughout your code

1179
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:20.779
base available whenever you

1180
00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:21.459
need it. You can

1181
00:25:21.459 --> 00:25:21.959
see we have it

1182
00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:22.598
here. We have it

1183
00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:23.557
in our tree. You

1184
00:25:23.557 --> 00:25:24.778
really want these inside

1185
00:25:24.778 --> 00:25:26.136
throughout your applications. We're

1186
00:25:26.136 --> 00:25:26.696
going to be building

1187
00:25:26.696 --> 00:25:27.355
these out as we

1188
00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:28.576
go along in tactical

1189
00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:29.454
agent to coding. All

1190
00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:30.055
right. You want to
