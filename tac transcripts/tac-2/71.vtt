00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:31.289
an hour, three hours.

1670
00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:32.768
Don't underestimate the amount

1671
00:35:32.768 --> 00:35:33.347
of work you can

1672
00:35:33.347 --> 00:35:35.367
hand off autonomously to

1673
00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:36.447
your agent. So that's

1674
00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:38.365
size. If you're improving,

1675
00:35:38.561 --> 00:35:39.721
your agent decoding, this

1676
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:40.960
number goes up. Now,

1677
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.400
of course, we have

1678
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.559
attempts. You know where

1679
00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:43.458
this is going, right?

1680
00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:44.539
We don't want issues.

1681
00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:45.079
We don't want to

1682
00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:46.197
miscommunicate. We don't want

1683
00:35:46.217 --> 00:35:46.818
to have to go

1684
00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:47.836
back in after the

1685
00:35:47.836 --> 00:35:49.735
prompt completes and fix

1686
00:35:49.735 --> 00:35:52.175
issues. This is attempts.

1687
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:52.893
You want to drive

1688
00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:54.574
your attempts down. Why

1689
00:35:54.574 --> 00:35:55.632
is that? It's because

1690
00:35:55.632 --> 00:35:56.572
attempts, when you have

1691
00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:57.371
to come back in,

1692
00:35:57.552 --> 00:35:58.791
prompt again, correct the

1693
00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.670
mistake, this costs your
