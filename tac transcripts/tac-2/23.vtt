502
00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:30.216
your commands and your

503
00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:31.917
scripts can guide your

504
00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:33.596
agent to success. Let

505
00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:34.456
me show you exactly

506
00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:35.174
what I mean in

507
00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:36.095
this codebase. If

508
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:36.615
we open up the

509
00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:38.274
application here, we can

510
00:11:38.354 --> 00:11:40.293
upload data and inside

511
00:11:40.293 --> 00:11:41.173
of the codebase,

512
00:11:41.212 --> 00:11:42.491
if we open app

513
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:44.691
client public sample data,

514
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.551
we have a couple

515
00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:46.291
of files here. Let's

516
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.090
open this in an

517
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.149
explorer. All right, so

518
00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:48.610
we're gonna drag and

519
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:49.688
drop this over. And

520
00:11:49.688 --> 00:11:50.328
you can see here

521
00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:51.208
we have an error,

522
00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.687
error converting CSV to

523
00:11:52.748 --> 00:11:54.366
SQLite, and there's some

524
00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:56.027
error message. Now we

525
00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:56.946
can see this. The

526
00:11:56.946 --> 00:11:58.225
real question though is,

527
00:11:58.225 --> 00:11:59.485
can our agent see

528
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.404
this? If we hop
