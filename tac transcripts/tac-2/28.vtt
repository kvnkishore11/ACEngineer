628
00:13:59.582 --> 00:14:00.523
cancel the front end

629
00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:01.761
and the backend and

630
00:14:01.822 --> 00:14:02.912
then boot them back

631
00:14:02.912 --> 00:14:04.240
up We can reopen

632
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.039
our front end here,

633
00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:06.278
refresh. And now you

634
00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.317
can see we have

635
00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:08.816
this success. If we

636
00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:12.532
re-upload this error, right?

637
00:14:12.532 --> 00:14:13.270
If we hop back

638
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.448
to the server, we

639
00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:15.508
now have an error

640
00:14:15.508 --> 00:14:17.625
message getting traced to

641
00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:19.546
standard out. Fantastic. Okay.

642
00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:20.485
So what we're doing

643
00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:21.644
here is we're building

644
00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:23.445
up a system for

645
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.764
our agent to solve

646
00:14:24.825 --> 00:14:26.585
problems, right? We're updating

647
00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:27.464
our codebase to

648
00:14:27.464 --> 00:14:29.323
communicate information to our

649
00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.323
agent. So this is
