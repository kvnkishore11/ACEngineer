1715
00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:31.043
right? Experimentation can be

1716
00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:32.003
done with your agents.

1717
00:36:32.003 --> 00:36:33.041
And that means you

1718
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.221
want fewer prompts. You

1719
00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:36.320
want fewer attempts. We're

1720
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.239
not aiming to become

1721
00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:38.858
a babysitter for AI

1722
00:36:38.858 --> 00:36:40.077
agents. We're looking for

1723
00:36:40.077 --> 00:36:42.376
one shot solutions. Okay.

1724
00:36:42.376 --> 00:36:43.054
You might be thinking,

1725
00:36:43.195 --> 00:36:44.373
why is iterating so

1726
00:36:44.373 --> 00:36:45.534
bad? The goal is

1727
00:36:45.534 --> 00:36:46.413
to maximize what we

1728
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:47.871
can do with agentic

1729
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:49.032
coding, right? This is

1730
00:36:49.032 --> 00:36:51.251
tactical Agentic Coding, not

1731
00:36:51.351 --> 00:36:53.409
iterative prompting, right? Not

1732
00:36:53.429 --> 00:36:54.889
iterative AI coding. This

1733
00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:55.847
iterative back and forth,

1734
00:36:55.907 --> 00:36:57.226
it's not very agentic,

1735
00:36:57.226 --> 00:36:57.967
is it? We're not

1736
00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:58.626
here to settle for

1737
00:36:58.626 --> 00:36:59.346
what's easy. We're here

1738
00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:00.206
to learn how to
