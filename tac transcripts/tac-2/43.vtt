998
00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:30.640
to cut all of

999
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.298
its work in half

1000
00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:31.959
when dealing with the

1001
00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:33.278
client or the server.

1002
00:21:33.554 --> 00:21:34.634
Okay, this is super,

1003
00:21:34.634 --> 00:21:35.692
super important. It might

1004
00:21:35.692 --> 00:21:37.232
seem simple, but three

1005
00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:38.811
simple codebased architectural

1006
00:21:38.811 --> 00:21:40.550
decisions will change how

1007
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.671
much time your agent

1008
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.170
spends just spinning, trying

1009
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:44.990
to figure out where

1010
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.328
everything is for the

1011
00:21:46.328 --> 00:21:47.929
nth time. Remember, we're

1012
00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:48.489
going to boot up

1013
00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:49.768
agents over and over

1014
00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:50.548
and over. We're talking

1015
00:21:50.548 --> 00:21:52.047
hundreds and thousands of

1016
00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:53.146
times. This is why

1017
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:53.826
we have to ask

1018
00:21:53.826 --> 00:21:54.945
ourselves, how easy is

1019
00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:56.554
it to reason about

1020
00:21:56.554 --> 00:21:57.513
the structure of our

1021
00:21:57.513 --> 00:21:58.712
codebase. How easy

1022
00:21:58.712 --> 00:21:59.732
is it to understand

1023
00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:01.031
how to operate your
