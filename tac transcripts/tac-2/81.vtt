1897
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:30.690
can improve them all

1898
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.170
by using one or

1899
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.210
more of the 12

1900
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.309
leverage points of agentic

1901
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:36.369
coding really four or

1902
00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:37.369
more right because the

1903
00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:38.581
core four are always

1904
00:40:38.581 --> 00:40:39.322
there. So, you know,

1905
00:40:39.322 --> 00:40:40.282
for example, does your

1906
00:40:40.282 --> 00:40:42.420
agent get confused because

1907
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.021
your codebase is

1908
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:44.400
using dictionaries instead of

1909
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.920
types, right? Obviously the

1910
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.099
clear answer there, leverage

1911
00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:48.119
types to improve your

1912
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:49.179
agent performance, all right?

1913
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.900
Is your codebase

1914
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.880
structure inconsistent and confusing

1915
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.978
to navigate even for

1916
00:40:52.978 --> 00:40:54.498
your team, right? Okay,

1917
00:40:54.699 --> 00:40:55.898
refactor your codebase,

1918
00:40:55.978 --> 00:40:56.539
build it for the

1919
00:40:56.539 --> 00:40:58.878
new age of agents.

1920
00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:00.038
Are you still manually
