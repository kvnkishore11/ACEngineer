834
00:17:58.623 --> 00:18:00.461
server, upload data, and

835
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:01.940
let's actually delete our

836
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.078
previous database file. There

837
00:18:03.078 --> 00:18:03.759
might be some issues

838
00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:04.778
there. We'll hit upload

839
00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:06.396
data, finder, drag and

840
00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:07.894
drop this in, and

841
00:18:07.894 --> 00:18:08.615
bam, look at that.

842
00:18:08.615 --> 00:18:09.693
We have these characters

843
00:18:09.693 --> 00:18:10.853
escaped. The issue's been

844
00:18:10.853 --> 00:18:11.932
resolved. We can say

845
00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:14.029
latest delivery. Okay, we'll

846
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:15.009
hit query, and now

847
00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:15.689
our code's going to

848
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:17.248
run as it should.

849
00:18:17.248 --> 00:18:18.086
Check this out, that's

850
00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:19.710
our latest delivery. Very

851
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.108
cool stuff. Now let's

852
00:18:21.108 --> 00:18:22.108
talk about another key

853
00:18:22.108 --> 00:18:23.528
leverage point. You've likely

854
00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:25.307
heard about how types

855
00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:28.125
and type languages reduce

856
00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:28.704
bugs, but why are

857
00:18:28.704 --> 00:18:29.584
they so important for

858
00:18:29.584 --> 00:18:31.343
agents? It's because types
