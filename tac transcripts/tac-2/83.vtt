1944
00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.146
Right. Be more detailed.

1945
00:41:30.166 --> 00:41:30.867
You can plan with

1946
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:32.045
your agent as you'll

1947
00:41:32.045 --> 00:41:32.818
see. In the next

1948
00:41:32.818 --> 00:41:34.056
lesson, all right? Does

1949
00:41:34.056 --> 00:41:34.916
your agent say it

1950
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:36.295
was successful? And then

1951
00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:37.175
you see bugs when

1952
00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:38.213
you run your application.

1953
00:41:38.574 --> 00:41:40.273
You need tests. And

1954
00:41:40.313 --> 00:41:40.992
as you're building up

1955
00:41:40.992 --> 00:41:41.911
new features, as you're

1956
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:43.311
writing prompts, have your

1957
00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:45.269
agent write tests as

1958
00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:46.708
it goes, right? Your

1959
00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:48.447
agent will automatically catch

1960
00:41:48.447 --> 00:41:49.766
and fix issues because

1961
00:41:49.766 --> 00:41:51.445
the output will go

1962
00:41:51.445 --> 00:41:52.425
right to standard in,

1963
00:41:52.644 --> 00:41:53.083
right? We can do

1964
00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:54.664
that right now anywhere

1965
00:41:54.802 --> 00:41:56.902
we want, PWD, bang,

1966
00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:59.036
CD, app server bang

1967
00:41:59.177 --> 00:42:00.815
UV run pie test.
