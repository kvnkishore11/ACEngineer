2104
00:44:58.753 --> 00:45:00.152
even further away from

2105
00:45:00.172 --> 00:45:01.753
manual coding. The new

2106
00:45:01.773 --> 00:45:03.552
age phase two engineering

2107
00:45:03.771 --> 00:45:05.110
looks less and less

2108
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.751
of what it used

2109
00:45:05.751 --> 00:45:06.789
to look like. What

2110
00:45:06.789 --> 00:45:08.429
does stay is architecture.

2111
00:45:08.429 --> 00:45:09.168
What does stay is

2112
00:45:09.168 --> 00:45:11.648
direction. It's planning. It's

2113
00:45:11.648 --> 00:45:13.306
thinking. It's engineering. It's

2114
00:45:13.487 --> 00:45:15.126
building out to create

2115
00:45:15.166 --> 00:45:16.465
value, right? This is

2116
00:45:16.525 --> 00:45:18.724
all about our products

2117
00:45:18.784 --> 00:45:19.824
and our products are

2118
00:45:19.824 --> 00:45:21.764
all about our users.

2119
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.302
Okay. Never lose sight

2120
00:45:23.302 --> 00:45:24.222
of that throughout every

2121
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.885
lesson, throughout all the

2122
00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:27.105
noise, bring it all

2123
00:45:27.105 --> 00:45:28.123
back to what this

2124
00:45:28.123 --> 00:45:29.063
is all for. We're

2125
00:45:29.063 --> 00:45:29.943
scaling up what we

2126
00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:31.322
can do. Once again,
