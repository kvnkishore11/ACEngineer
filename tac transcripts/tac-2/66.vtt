1554
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.904
happen autonomously. This is

1555
00:33:00.904 --> 00:33:01.724
the leverage point we'll

1556
00:33:01.724 --> 00:33:03.085
use to automate the

1557
00:33:03.085 --> 00:33:05.124
software development lifecycle so

1558
00:33:05.124 --> 00:33:06.263
well that your code

1559
00:33:06.263 --> 00:33:07.863
base literally runs itself.

1560
00:33:07.863 --> 00:33:09.303
Every tactic and concept

1561
00:33:09.303 --> 00:33:10.842
from each lesson pushes

1562
00:33:10.842 --> 00:33:12.422
us toward this final

1563
00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:14.381
leverage point, ADW, the

1564
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.359
AI developer workflow. Okay.

1565
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.779
This is prompts combined

1566
00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:19.278
with code, combined with

1567
00:33:19.278 --> 00:33:20.519
a trigger so that

1568
00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.417
it all runs itself.

1569
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:23.690
Now, Don't worry if

1570
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.388
it feels like we've

1571
00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:25.607
breezed through some of

1572
00:33:25.607 --> 00:33:26.708
these leverage points. We'll

1573
00:33:26.708 --> 00:33:27.967
be using these in

1574
00:33:27.967 --> 00:33:29.286
every lesson moving forward.

1575
00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:29.746
These are going to

1576
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:30.585
come back up over
