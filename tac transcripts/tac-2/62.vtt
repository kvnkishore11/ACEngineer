1464
00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:00.484
well you write your

1465
00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:01.564
plans. If you can

1466
00:31:01.564 --> 00:31:02.442
do the planning step

1467
00:31:02.462 --> 00:31:03.641
well, which we'll discuss

1468
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:04.759
in our next lesson,

1469
00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:05.978
every other step of

1470
00:31:05.978 --> 00:31:07.675
the software developer lifecycle

1471
00:31:07.675 --> 00:31:08.855
we're gonna be augmenting

1472
00:31:09.055 --> 00:31:10.811
and automating falls right

1473
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:11.691
into place, but it

1474
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.829
all starts with a

1475
00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:14.028
great plan. It all

1476
00:31:14.028 --> 00:31:16.445
starts by communicating with

1477
00:31:16.445 --> 00:31:17.644
your agent. This is

1478
00:31:17.644 --> 00:31:19.003
a fundamental principle of

1479
00:31:19.023 --> 00:31:20.442
AI coding that translates

1480
00:31:20.442 --> 00:31:22.260
directly to the superset

1481
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:23.440
of Agentic Coding. The

1482
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.739
plan is the prompt

1483
00:31:24.739 --> 00:31:25.479
and that means great

1484
00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:27.137
planning is great prompting.

1485
00:31:27.137 --> 00:31:28.237
And so that leaves

1486
00:31:28.237 --> 00:31:29.256
us with two more

1487
00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.734
leverage points. We have
