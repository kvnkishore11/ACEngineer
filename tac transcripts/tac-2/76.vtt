1785
00:37:58.617 --> 00:38:00.255
you start one-shotting, don't

1786
00:38:00.295 --> 00:38:01.576
break the streak. Keep

1787
00:38:01.576 --> 00:38:02.454
that chain going. And

1788
00:38:02.474 --> 00:38:03.394
when you break it,

1789
00:38:03.474 --> 00:38:05.594
figure out exactly which

1790
00:38:05.594 --> 00:38:06.913
leverage point you were

1791
00:38:06.913 --> 00:38:07.932
missing. Because what we're

1792
00:38:07.932 --> 00:38:09.193
gonna do here is

1793
00:38:09.193 --> 00:38:10.192
hand all of this

1794
00:38:10.192 --> 00:38:11.971
off to our agentic

1795
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.331
codebase, right? Our

1796
00:38:13.331 --> 00:38:14.429
agents operating our code

1797
00:38:14.429 --> 00:38:15.289
base. And we need

1798
00:38:15.289 --> 00:38:15.750
them to be able

1799
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.369
to run reliably with

1800
00:38:17.369 --> 00:38:19.768
extremely high accuracy, okay?

1801
00:38:20.148 --> 00:38:20.547
This is what we're

1802
00:38:20.547 --> 00:38:21.447
building up to. The

1803
00:38:21.447 --> 00:38:22.786
last is likely the

1804
00:38:22.786 --> 00:38:25.429
most important. Presence you

1805
00:38:25.429 --> 00:38:26.009
want to lower your

1806
00:38:26.009 --> 00:38:27.548
presence to zero presence

1807
00:38:27.548 --> 00:38:28.188
is a measure of

1808
00:38:28.188 --> 00:38:29.648
how much you the

1809
00:38:29.648 --> 00:38:31.068
engineer have to sit
