00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:00.904
logging level to only

781
00:17:00.904 --> 00:17:03.403
log warnings and errors.

782
00:17:03.442 --> 00:17:04.143
Although, you know, I

783
00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:05.142
will say warnings and

784
00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:06.021
errors are only part

785
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:07.121
of the story. You

786
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.319
really want your agent

787
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.459
to have the full

788
00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:10.659
standard output so it

789
00:17:10.659 --> 00:17:12.178
can really see everything

790
00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:12.896
that's going on in

791
00:17:12.896 --> 00:17:14.017
your application. Just like

792
00:17:14.037 --> 00:17:15.076
we did here, if

793
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:15.736
you give your agent

794
00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:17.095
the top level, it

795
00:17:17.095 --> 00:17:18.134
can at least know

796
00:17:18.134 --> 00:17:19.613
what methods are involved

797
00:17:19.613 --> 00:17:20.792
with the issue, which

798
00:17:20.813 --> 00:17:23.030
drastically reduces the state

799
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.329
space. It reduces all

800
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.509
the files, all the

801
00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:27.368
complexity that your agent

802
00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:28.407
has to run through

803
00:17:28.407 --> 00:17:29.728
to narrow down where

804
00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:31.346
issues are. Okay. There's
