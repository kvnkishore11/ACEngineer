858
00:18:29.584 --> 00:18:31.343
agents? It's because types

859
00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:32.682
tell a story about

860
00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:34.561
how information travels throughout

861
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.820
your codebase. When

862
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.940
you have dedicated types

863
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.799
in your application, you

864
00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.659
create a traceable flow

865
00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:41.357
of information your agent

866
00:18:41.357 --> 00:18:42.576
can follow, right? In

867
00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:43.277
fact, you can do

868
00:18:43.277 --> 00:18:44.096
something like this, right?

869
00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:44.816
Let's open up our

870
00:18:44.816 --> 00:18:46.194
type file here. Let's

871
00:18:46.194 --> 00:18:47.295
go to data models.

872
00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:49.026
Let's collapse. And let's

873
00:18:49.026 --> 00:18:50.046
just copy any one

874
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:50.845
of our data models

875
00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:51.644
here, right? Let's copy

876
00:18:51.644 --> 00:18:54.364
the database schema response

877
00:18:54.364 --> 00:18:54.983
and then we'll prompt

878
00:18:54.983 --> 00:18:55.544
this. I'm going to

879
00:18:55.544 --> 00:18:56.124
do a new Claude

880
00:18:56.124 --> 00:18:57.242
instance because I don't

881
00:18:57.242 --> 00:18:57.923
want Claude to have

882
00:18:58.022 --> 00:18:59.962
any context about what's

883
00:18:59.962 --> 00:19:00.602
going on here. All
