387
00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:00.816
the codebase. That's

388
00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:01.715
exactly what it's done

389
00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:02.774
here. We have a

390
00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:04.374
front end, backend, AI

391
00:09:04.374 --> 00:09:06.432
integration, and a database.

392
00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:07.592
Fantastic. Let's turn our

393
00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:08.592
attention to the in-agent

394
00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:10.371
leverage points of agentic

395
00:09:10.371 --> 00:09:11.392
coding. Now we're already

396
00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:12.791
familiar with the in-agent

397
00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:13.870
leverage points. This is

398
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.051
just the core four,

399
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:16.171
right? The context, the

400
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.090
model, the prompt, and

401
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.830
the tools. But let's

402
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.028
briefly touch on tools.

403
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:21.229
We'll gloss over the

404
00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:22.609
context model and prompt

405
00:09:22.609 --> 00:09:23.208
so we can focus

406
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:24.148
on the heavy hitting

407
00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:25.947
through agent leverage points.

408
00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:27.206
So with Claude Code,

409
00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:28.767
the tools are embedded

410
00:09:28.947 --> 00:09:30.086
in its system prompt.
