00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:30.346
it detailed inside of

955
00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.066
our original spec file.

956
00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.663
Remember that types are

957
00:20:33.683 --> 00:20:36.541
IDKs information dense keywords.

958
00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:37.929
They point to exact

959
00:20:37.929 --> 00:20:39.288
locations in your code

960
00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:40.186
base and represent the

961
00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:41.885
flow of a specific

962
00:20:41.885 --> 00:20:43.325
type of information. You've

963
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.163
likely done this where

964
00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:45.064
you copy a type

965
00:20:45.064 --> 00:20:46.083
or a class and

966
00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:46.801
then you search throughout

967
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:48.121
the entire application and

968
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:48.901
it tells you where

969
00:20:48.901 --> 00:20:50.279
all instances of this

970
00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:51.598
type is, which tells

971
00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:52.978
a story about the

972
00:20:52.978 --> 00:20:54.715
data and an information

973
00:20:54.715 --> 00:20:56.015
flow that you and

974
00:20:56.015 --> 00:20:57.733
now, more importantly, your

975
00:20:57.753 --> 00:20:59.532
agents can follow to

976
00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:01.011
deliver on engineering work.
