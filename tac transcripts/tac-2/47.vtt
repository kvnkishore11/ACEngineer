1096
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.318
your codebases to

1097
00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:32.058
help redesign it for

1098
00:23:32.058 --> 00:23:33.738
your agent. Okay. More

1099
00:23:33.738 --> 00:23:34.596
and more, it's going

1100
00:23:34.596 --> 00:23:35.396
to be our agent

1101
00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:36.935
operator codebases, not

1102
00:23:36.935 --> 00:23:38.175
us. Right? So we

1103
00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:39.075
need to build for

1104
00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:40.015
them. We want our

1105
00:23:40.015 --> 00:23:40.894
codebases to be

1106
00:23:40.933 --> 00:23:42.513
token efficient. So I'm

1107
00:23:42.513 --> 00:23:43.353
just going to run

1108
00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:44.432
through some here. You'll

1109
00:23:44.432 --> 00:23:45.511
also have a concise

1110
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:46.791
list in your loot

1111
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:48.050
box below. Don't forget,

1112
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.510
we're stacking up a

1113
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.710
bunch of important loot

1114
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.801
for you. To help

1115
00:23:50.801 --> 00:23:52.000
you quickly connect and

1116
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.220
reconnect with these ideas

1117
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.138
over time as you're

1118
00:23:54.138 --> 00:23:55.198
doing real engineering work.

1119
00:23:55.198 --> 00:23:55.778
What are some of

1120
00:23:55.778 --> 00:23:56.896
these items? What are

1121
00:23:56.896 --> 00:23:57.576
some ways we can

1122
00:23:57.576 --> 00:23:58.816
be consistent throughout our

1123
00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:00.554
codebased architecture? Use
