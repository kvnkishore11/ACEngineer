276
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.288
and back end dependencies.

277
00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:02.348
We're using a powerful

278
00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:03.908
pattern of running prompts

279
00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.127
inside of prompts. This

280
00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:05.947
is no different than

281
00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:08.086
passing a function inside

282
00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:08.706
of a function. We

283
00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:09.387
can open up the

284
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.247
prime method and you

285
00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:11.067
can see exactly what

286
00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:12.805
this does. Get else

287
00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:13.870
files. And then we

288
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.168
read the readme. This

289
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.367
is how our install

290
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:17.908
command knows how to

291
00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:18.867
install the front end

292
00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:19.786
and back end dependencies.

293
00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:20.226
If we look at

294
00:07:20.226 --> 00:07:21.206
the Claude Codes output

295
00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:22.105
here, we can see

296
00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:23.144
that's exactly what's been

297
00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:23.644
done. Look at all

298
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:24.584
this engineering work that

299
00:07:24.584 --> 00:07:26.363
just happened agentically doing

300
00:07:26.384 --> 00:07:27.663
things one step at

301
00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:28.562
a time until it's

302
00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:29.961
all complete. Let's open

303
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.221
up the readme and
