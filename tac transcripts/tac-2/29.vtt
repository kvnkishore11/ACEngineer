649
00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.323
agent. So this is

650
00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:31.024
great. Now what we

651
00:14:31.024 --> 00:14:32.504
can do is close

652
00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:33.763
the server here and

653
00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:34.682
open up a brand

654
00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:36.062
new agent instance. Let's

655
00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:36.523
open up a new

656
00:14:36.523 --> 00:14:37.562
cloud instance. Now we'll

657
00:14:37.562 --> 00:14:38.263
do something great. Let's

658
00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:38.822
go ahead and prime

659
00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:39.741
our agent again. We

660
00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:40.981
wanted to understand the

661
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.621
structure of our application.

662
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:44.160
The prime custom slash

663
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.301
command is super, super

664
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.980
important. This in combination

665
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.099
with the claw.md lets

666
00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.177
your agent quickly get

667
00:14:50.177 --> 00:14:51.597
ramped up with information

668
00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:52.256
about your codebase.

669
00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:53.096
We'll talk about that

670
00:14:53.096 --> 00:14:55.056
leverage point, the documentation

671
00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:56.174
leverage point more in

672
00:14:56.174 --> 00:14:56.995
just a moment, but

673
00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:57.495
you can see our

674
00:14:57.495 --> 00:14:58.734
agent is primed. Now

675
00:14:58.734 --> 00:14:59.413
I want to run

676
00:14:59.413 --> 00:15:00.173
the following. I want
