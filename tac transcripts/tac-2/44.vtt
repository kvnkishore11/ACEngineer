1023
00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:01.031
how to operate your

1024
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:02.231
codebase and run

1025
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:03.412
different commands, right? If

1026
00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:04.131
it's hard for you,

1027
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.111
you should assume it'll

1028
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:05.911
be hard for your

1029
00:22:05.911 --> 00:22:06.950
agent. You know, it's

1030
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:07.930
not that codebases

1031
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.170
can't be complex. They

1032
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.729
will be complex. Successful

1033
00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:11.729
codebases. If your

1034
00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:12.988
application tool or product

1035
00:22:12.988 --> 00:22:13.968
is successful, it will

1036
00:22:13.968 --> 00:22:15.448
grow by nature, right?

1037
00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:17.106
The best preventative action

1038
00:22:17.106 --> 00:22:19.346
against this is consistency.

1039
00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:20.605
No matter how complex

1040
00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:21.673
If you reuse the

1041
00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:24.073
same patterns, folder structures,

1042
00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:25.972
function names, file names,

1043
00:22:26.032 --> 00:22:27.692
comment structure, your code

1044
00:22:27.692 --> 00:22:28.632
base will be consistent

1045
00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:29.892
and consistency is a

1046
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:32.191
powerful actor against complexity
