2014
00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:00.753
right. Very important stuff

2015
00:43:00.753 --> 00:43:01.512
there, right? So the

2016
00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:02.731
examples here go on

2017
00:43:02.731 --> 00:43:03.251
and on and on.

2018
00:43:03.271 --> 00:43:04.409
As you work through

2019
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.469
the 12 leverage points,

2020
00:43:06.548 --> 00:43:08.106
you'll notice one tactic

2021
00:43:08.106 --> 00:43:09.565
that summarizes it all.

2022
00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:11.025
You must adopt your

2023
00:43:11.025 --> 00:43:13.063
agent's perspective. This tactic

2024
00:43:13.063 --> 00:43:14.003
will drive your success

2025
00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:15.362
as an engineer that

2026
00:43:15.362 --> 00:43:17.041
wields and deploys agents

2027
00:43:17.081 --> 00:43:18.981
across your codebase.

2028
00:43:19.001 --> 00:43:19.940
It's not about you

2029
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.039
anymore. It's about what

2030
00:43:21.039 --> 00:43:21.938
you can do for

2031
00:43:21.938 --> 00:43:23.177
your agent so they

2032
00:43:23.177 --> 00:43:24.416
can work for you.

2033
00:43:24.637 --> 00:43:25.735
Okay? By adopting your

2034
00:43:25.735 --> 00:43:27.315
agent's perspective, you do

2035
00:43:27.356 --> 00:43:29.135
four things. You send

2036
00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:30.414
the size of your
