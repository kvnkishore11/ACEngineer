1600
00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:01.375
know we're actually doing

1601
00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:02.675
things right? How do

1602
00:34:02.675 --> 00:34:03.556
we know we're improving?

1603
00:34:03.556 --> 00:34:04.096
Let's go ahead and

1604
00:34:04.096 --> 00:34:05.076
just crack open a

1605
00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.015
classic markdown file and

1606
00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:07.694
just take a look

1607
00:34:07.694 --> 00:34:09.195
at this. Okay. How

1608
00:34:09.434 --> 00:34:10.355
do we know we're

1609
00:34:10.355 --> 00:34:13.054
improving as Agentic Engineers?

1610
00:34:13.414 --> 00:34:15.614
We have four KPIs.

1611
00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:16.661
There are just four

1612
00:34:16.661 --> 00:34:17.501
numbers that make up

1613
00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:19.480
your Agentic Coding key

1614
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.458
performance indicators, right? We

1615
00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:24.056
have size attempts, we

1616
00:34:24.056 --> 00:34:25.097
have streak, and we

1617
00:34:25.097 --> 00:34:27.056
have presence. This is

1618
00:34:27.056 --> 00:34:28.014
it. This is all

1619
00:34:28.014 --> 00:34:28.614
we need to track

1620
00:34:28.614 --> 00:34:29.634
to win. So let's

1621
00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.634
just walk through these
