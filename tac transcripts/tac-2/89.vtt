2078
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.409
using Claude Code. We'll

2079
00:44:30.409 --> 00:44:32.108
be using AI agents

2080
00:44:32.108 --> 00:44:33.146
to do engineering work

2081
00:44:33.186 --> 00:44:34.365
autonomously. This will be

2082
00:44:34.365 --> 00:44:35.945
uncomfortable. As us engineers,

2083
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:37.023
we love control and

2084
00:44:37.023 --> 00:44:38.204
visibility, but it's time

2085
00:44:38.204 --> 00:44:38.902
for us to let

2086
00:44:38.902 --> 00:44:39.802
that go. In order

2087
00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:40.681
to let our code

2088
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:42.221
base run itself, we

2089
00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:43.539
have to let go

2090
00:44:43.539 --> 00:44:44.858
of control. We still

2091
00:44:44.858 --> 00:44:45.679
need to know exactly

2092
00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:46.777
what's happening. We still

2093
00:44:46.777 --> 00:44:47.277
need to be able

2094
00:44:47.277 --> 00:44:48.356
to observe, but we

2095
00:44:48.356 --> 00:44:49.215
need to let go

2096
00:44:49.315 --> 00:44:50.614
of the hands-on engineering,

2097
00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:50.994
right? We have to

2098
00:44:50.994 --> 00:44:52.074
stop coding. This is

2099
00:44:52.074 --> 00:44:53.074
going to be hard.

2100
00:44:53.094 --> 00:44:53.932
The hardest thing we

2101
00:44:53.932 --> 00:44:55.251
do in tactical agentic

2102
00:44:55.251 --> 00:44:57.311
coding is transition away

2103
00:44:57.311 --> 00:44:58.750
from AI coding and

2104
00:44:58.753 --> 00:45:00.152
even further away from
