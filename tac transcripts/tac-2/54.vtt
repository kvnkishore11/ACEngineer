WEBVTT

1266
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.221
simple. There are two

1267
00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:02.500
types, internal documentation and

1268
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.838
external documentation. AI docs

1269
00:27:04.838 --> 00:27:06.238
is a dedicated folder

1270
00:27:06.337 --> 00:27:08.895
specifically for our agents.

1271
00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:09.576
You don't want them

1272
00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:11.095
making web requests every

1273
00:27:11.095 --> 00:27:11.513
time they have to

1274
00:27:11.513 --> 00:27:12.273
look something up. Just

1275
00:27:12.294 --> 00:27:13.313
get it local, get

1276
00:27:13.313 --> 00:27:14.232
it right here so

1277
00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.392
you can write plans

1278
00:27:15.392 --> 00:27:16.570
and do work when

1279
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.351
you need it, if

1280
00:27:17.351 --> 00:27:18.730
you need it. Documentation

1281
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.528
and codebase architecture

1282
00:27:20.587 --> 00:27:21.708
overlap a little bit.

1283
00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:22.906
There are tools like

1284
00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:25.045
RepoMix and other Git

1285
00:27:25.045 --> 00:27:26.045
related tools that help

1286
00:27:26.045 --> 00:27:27.163
you pull in open

1287
00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:28.643
source codebases and

1288
00:27:28.643 --> 00:27:29.842
make web requests. If

1289
00:27:29.842 --> 00:27:30.902
you remember here, if
