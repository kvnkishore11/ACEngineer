1576
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:30.585
come back up over

1577
00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:31.204
and over and over.

1578
00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:32.743
Okay, let's talk about

1579
00:33:32.743 --> 00:33:33.982
how to measure success

1580
00:33:34.343 --> 00:33:35.882
and round out this

1581
00:33:35.882 --> 00:33:37.740
really important lesson. Fantastic

1582
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.340
work so far, by

1583
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.099
the way. I know

1584
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:39.660
there's a lot of

1585
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.759
content here. We're working

1586
00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:41.179
through a lot of

1587
00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:42.518
key ideas, but this

1588
00:33:42.518 --> 00:33:44.297
extends the groundwork we're

1589
00:33:44.297 --> 00:33:45.316
setting and lets us

1590
00:33:45.316 --> 00:33:45.875
get in the right

1591
00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:48.035
headspace to transition from

1592
00:33:48.035 --> 00:33:49.438
AI coding where we're

1593
00:33:49.438 --> 00:33:50.877
prompting over and over

1594
00:33:50.978 --> 00:33:53.297
iteratively, right? To real

1595
00:33:53.356 --> 00:33:54.717
Agentic Coding where our

1596
00:33:54.717 --> 00:33:55.777
agents are really doing

1597
00:33:55.777 --> 00:33:57.037
the work. Okay. So

1598
00:33:57.317 --> 00:33:58.916
let's talk about KPIs.

1599
00:33:58.936 --> 00:33:59.415
So how do we

1600
00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:01.375
know we're actually doing
