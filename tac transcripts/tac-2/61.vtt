00:30:29.457 --> 00:30:30.155
And as you may

1439
00:30:30.155 --> 00:30:31.016
have noticed by looking

1440
00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:32.614
at this, there is

1441
00:30:32.614 --> 00:30:33.473
no way that I

1442
00:30:33.473 --> 00:30:35.491
sat here and typed

1443
00:30:35.491 --> 00:30:36.570
out 700 lines of

1444
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.310
a plan. We are

1445
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.049
going to be planning

1446
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.288
with our agent. We're

1447
00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:40.048
going to showcase how

1448
00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:40.847
you can take your

1449
00:30:40.847 --> 00:30:42.626
high level, low information,

1450
00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:44.805
frankly, bad prompt, hand

1451
00:30:44.805 --> 00:30:45.663
it to your agent

1452
00:30:45.784 --> 00:30:46.784
and let it generate

1453
00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:48.201
the first draft of

1454
00:30:48.201 --> 00:30:49.021
your plan for you.

1455
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:50.121
Okay. Planning is the

1456
00:30:50.121 --> 00:30:51.720
first key step of

1457
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.838
the software development life

1458
00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:53.817
cycle. You need to

1459
00:30:53.817 --> 00:30:54.597
know what you want.

1460
00:30:54.597 --> 00:30:55.317
You need to define

1461
00:30:55.317 --> 00:30:56.215
it and your ability

1462
00:30:56.215 --> 00:30:58.154
to communicate that information

1463
00:30:58.154 --> 00:30:58.874
is all about how

1464
00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:00.484
well you write your
