00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:00.554
codebased architecture? Use

1124
00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:02.393
clear entry points, no

1125
00:24:02.393 --> 00:24:03.592
matter what service it

1126
00:24:03.592 --> 00:24:04.611
is, right? Server or

1127
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:05.730
client, right? Make sure

1128
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:06.609
it's clear where it

1129
00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:07.648
starts. You saw we

1130
00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:09.728
had the server.python file

1131
00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:11.226
very quickly. Our agent

1132
00:24:11.226 --> 00:24:12.086
knows to look for

1133
00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:13.424
this main file to

1134
00:24:13.424 --> 00:24:14.023
get started with the

1135
00:24:14.023 --> 00:24:15.823
server. Okay. Use clear

1136
00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:17.921
entry points, use constant

1137
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:20.019
files for unchanging information,

1138
00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:21.798
use types, classes, and

1139
00:24:21.798 --> 00:24:23.836
structures, use meaningful and

1140
00:24:23.836 --> 00:24:26.875
verbose directory, file, type,

1141
00:24:26.954 --> 00:24:29.232
class, and variable names.

1142
00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:30.672
Remember that everything you
