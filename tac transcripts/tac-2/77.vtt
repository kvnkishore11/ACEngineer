1809
00:38:29.648 --> 00:38:31.068
engineer have to sit

1810
00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:32.867
guide and correct your

1811
00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:34.025
ai agent right now

1812
00:38:34.085 --> 00:38:35.726
engineers are in fact

1813
00:38:35.726 --> 00:38:37.925
operating with high presence

1814
00:38:37.945 --> 00:38:38.864
we think that the

1815
00:38:38.864 --> 00:38:40.164
end game of agentic

1816
00:38:40.164 --> 00:38:41.264
coding is sitting here

1817
00:38:41.563 --> 00:38:42.563
and prompting back and

1818
00:38:42.563 --> 00:38:43.862
forth and back and

1819
00:38:43.862 --> 00:38:45.842
forth right monitoring reviewing

1820
00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:47.454
everything This is not

1821
00:38:47.454 --> 00:38:48.233
the end game. This

1822
00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:48.992
is the early game.

1823
00:38:49.152 --> 00:38:50.472
With Agentic Coding, you

1824
00:38:50.472 --> 00:38:52.032
can truly drop your

1825
00:38:52.032 --> 00:38:53.990
presence to zero. The

1826
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.369
balancing act here is

1827
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.590
learning what you can

1828
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.369
do with full autonomy,

1829
00:38:58.509 --> 00:38:59.867
right? With the autonomy

1830
00:38:59.867 --> 00:39:01.027
knob dialed up to
