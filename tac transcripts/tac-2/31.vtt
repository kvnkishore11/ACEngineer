WEBVTT

701
00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.208
has access to standard

702
00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:31.807
out upload data. And

703
00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:32.488
let's drop this in

704
00:15:32.488 --> 00:15:34.307
here once again. Okay.

705
00:15:34.407 --> 00:15:35.186
So we have that

706
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.673
error. And now we

707
00:15:36.673 --> 00:15:37.913
know for a fact

708
00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.153
that our agent has

709
00:15:39.153 --> 00:15:40.913
seen the error. From

710
00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:42.731
our agent's perspective, it

711
00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:44.812
is seeing the standard

712
00:15:44.812 --> 00:15:46.052
out from the start

713
00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:47.172
script, which shows output

714
00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:48.230
from the server and

715
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.650
the client. Fantastic. So

716
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.110
now I'm going to

717
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.471
stop running this and

718
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:51.890
then I'm just going

719
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.409
to prompt any issues

720
00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:55.505
with the server. Now

721
00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:56.326
we know there's an

722
00:15:56.326 --> 00:15:57.566
issue, right? But we're

723
00:15:57.566 --> 00:15:58.725
just validating it with

724
00:15:58.725 --> 00:15:59.804
our agent here. Let's

725
00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:00.284
see what it comes
