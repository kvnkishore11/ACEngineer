00:45:59.831 --> 00:46:01.389
off a single powerful

2149
00:46:01.389 --> 00:46:02.610
agent running a single

2150
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.489
prompt right remember Big

2151
00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:05.630
things are just two

2152
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:06.369
or more small things

2153
00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:07.170
put together. If you

2154
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.789
do the simple thing

2155
00:46:07.789 --> 00:46:08.668
well, you will be

2156
00:46:08.668 --> 00:46:09.548
able to scale it

2157
00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:11.309
into something valuable. Master

2158
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:12.369
the primitives and you'll

2159
00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:14.088
master the compositions. As

2160
00:46:14.088 --> 00:46:14.668
we work through each

2161
00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:15.927
lesson, we're not coding

2162
00:46:15.927 --> 00:46:17.768
anymore. We're adopting our

2163
00:46:17.768 --> 00:46:19.407
agent's perspective. We're leaning

2164
00:46:19.407 --> 00:46:20.947
in to the autonomy.

2165
00:46:20.967 --> 00:46:21.887
This enables us to

2166
00:46:21.887 --> 00:46:23.166
give our agents the

2167
00:46:23.166 --> 00:46:24.726
leverage points it needs

2168
00:46:24.726 --> 00:46:26.186
to ship engineering work

2169
00:46:26.186 --> 00:46:27.347
on our behalf. Now

2170
00:46:27.347 --> 00:46:28.467
we've glossed over a

2171
00:46:28.467 --> 00:46:29.585
couple of leverage points

2172
00:46:29.585 --> 00:46:31.146
because they're so powerful,
