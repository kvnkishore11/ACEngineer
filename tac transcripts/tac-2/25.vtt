552
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.190
fix the issue. So

553
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.330
open up code, I'll

554
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.389
boot up a brand

555
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:33.649
new agent here. I'll

556
00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:35.188
type Claude, I'll type

557
00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:36.288
Prime. So we're just

558
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.447
running that Prime command.

559
00:12:37.447 --> 00:12:38.327
We don't want install,

560
00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:39.388
we've already done that.

561
00:12:39.388 --> 00:12:40.128
So there it goes.

562
00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:41.626
Once again, just rerunning

563
00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.567
this small, short, but

564
00:12:43.567 --> 00:12:46.238
powerful agent workflow It's

565
00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:47.197
running Git LS and

566
00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:48.236
it's reading some files.

567
00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:48.996
And now let's run

568
00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:50.936
this. In our directory

569
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.275
here, we can see

570
00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:52.595
app server. If we

571
00:12:52.595 --> 00:12:53.995
scroll down here to

572
00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:54.793
server, we can see

573
00:12:54.793 --> 00:12:55.793
exactly what our API

574
00:12:55.793 --> 00:12:56.773
endpoints look like. If

575
00:12:56.773 --> 00:12:57.653
we collapse all the

576
00:12:57.653 --> 00:12:58.971
code here, you can

577
00:12:58.971 --> 00:12:59.792
see we have a

578
00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.192
bunch of endpoints that
