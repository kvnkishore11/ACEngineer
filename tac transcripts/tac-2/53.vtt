00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:31.518
massive long-term effect on

1243
00:26:31.518 --> 00:26:33.276
your ability to improve

1244
00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:34.516
your Agentic Coding. We'll

1245
00:26:34.516 --> 00:26:36.374
discuss measuring the success

1246
00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.932
with key KPIs of

1247
00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:39.332
Agentic Coding after we

1248
00:26:39.332 --> 00:26:40.011
break down a few

1249
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:41.111
more leverage points here.

1250
00:26:41.111 --> 00:26:41.651
We're not gonna deep

1251
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:42.430
dive into all these

1252
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.250
here. Many of these

1253
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.608
points have their own

1254
00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:46.048
dedicated lesson. So let's

1255
00:26:46.048 --> 00:26:47.287
talk about documentation. This

1256
00:26:47.287 --> 00:26:47.787
is a big one.

1257
00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:48.605
We have an entire

1258
00:26:48.605 --> 00:26:50.585
lesson dedicated to docs,

1259
00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:52.005
tests, and plans. So

1260
00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:52.763
we're not gonna deep

1261
00:26:52.763 --> 00:26:54.503
dive into these, but

1262
00:26:54.503 --> 00:26:55.242
this is an important

1263
00:26:55.242 --> 00:26:56.603
leverage point, right? It'll

1264
00:26:56.603 --> 00:26:57.261
make or break your

1265
00:26:57.261 --> 00:26:59.201
success. Documentation is really

1266
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.221
simple. There are two
