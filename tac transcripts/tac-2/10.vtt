193
00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:01.821
hot streak possible of

194
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:03.319
success. When you stack

195
00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.439
up these leverage points,

196
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.697
Agentic Coding success becomes

197
00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:08.338
inevitable. Now, what are

198
00:05:08.338 --> 00:05:09.476
these leverage points? Let's

199
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.557
break them down and

200
00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:11.076
look at a few

201
00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.375
of them in action.

202
00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:13.615
There are two types

203
00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:14.894
of leverage points in

204
00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:16.814
agent and through agent

205
00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:18.192
in agent leverage points

206
00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:19.752
contain the core four.

207
00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:20.872
These are in the

208
00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:22.690
agent because they're always

209
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.310
with your agent context,

210
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.362
model, prompt, tools. We're

211
00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:27.281
very aware of these.

212
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:28.321
We're very comfortable with

213
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:29.639
these ideas. We use

214
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.459
them all the time,
