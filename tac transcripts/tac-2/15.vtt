303
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.221
up the readme and

304
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:32.860
let's get our environment

305
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.319
variables installed so that

306
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.079
we can run this

307
00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.158
application. This is going

308
00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:36.918
to be in step

309
00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:37.937
two here. Setting up

310
00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:38.997
your configuration. We open

311
00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:40.276
up app server. We

312
00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:41.057
want to set up

313
00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:42.255
a dot environment variable

314
00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:43.276
file here for our

315
00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:43.915
server. I'm going to

316
00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:44.415
go ahead and copy

317
00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:45.535
the send. Of course,

318
00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:46.154
make sure you don't

319
00:07:46.154 --> 00:07:47.115
leak this to anyone.

320
00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:47.574
All right. So I

321
00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:48.514
have my environment variable

322
00:07:48.514 --> 00:07:49.214
there. If you look

323
00:07:49.214 --> 00:07:49.874
at the sample, you

324
00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:50.613
can see we just

325
00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:51.314
need an open AI

326
00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:52.713
key and the anthropic

327
00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:53.894
API key. All right.

328
00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:54.653
And then we can

329
00:07:54.653 --> 00:07:56.173
run our start setup

330
00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:56.952
script. This will kick

331
00:07:56.952 --> 00:07:57.733
off both the front

332
00:07:57.733 --> 00:07:58.531
end and the back

333
00:07:58.531 --> 00:07:59.372
end. We're just going

334
00:07:59.372 --> 00:07:59.851
to open up a

335
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:00.872
brand new terminal window
