68
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.388
and automate key steps

69
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.429
so that your agent

70
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.007
ships on your behalf.

71
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:03.968
When I say your

72
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.507
codebase will literally run

73
00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:07.025
itself, I mean that.

74
00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:07.725
We're not here to

75
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:09.405
write bigger prompts and

76
00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:10.465
iterate back and forth

77
00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:11.403
and back and forth.

78
00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:13.063
We're here to dial

79
00:02:13.063 --> 00:02:14.263
up the autonomy knob

80
00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:15.362
all the way to

81
00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:16.542
11. We're here to

82
00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:19.181
become Agentic Engineers. How

83
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:19.960
well you do this

84
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.699
determines your progression as

85
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.278
an engineer in phase

86
00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:24.617
two of the generative

87
00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.097
AI age. This lesson

88
00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:28.016
focuses on three key

89
00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.675
topics. We'll break down

90
00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.096
a new tactic that
