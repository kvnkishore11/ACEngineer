1967
00:41:59.177 --> 00:42:00.815
UV run pie test.

1968
00:42:00.936 --> 00:42:01.914
Okay. And now the

1969
00:42:01.914 --> 00:42:03.034
agent has all the

1970
00:42:03.034 --> 00:42:04.213
tests, all the output,

1971
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:05.411
all the details, all

1972
00:42:05.411 --> 00:42:06.532
the errors right in

1973
00:42:06.532 --> 00:42:07.550
this context window. It

1974
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.230
can agentically solve this

1975
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.148
problem for you. Okay.

1976
00:42:10.429 --> 00:42:11.568
Right tests. Are you

1977
00:42:11.568 --> 00:42:13.226
running the same prompts,

1978
00:42:13.286 --> 00:42:14.766
the same workflows over

1979
00:42:14.766 --> 00:42:15.346
and over and over,

1980
00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:16.344
right? For instance, we

1981
00:42:16.344 --> 00:42:17.103
had our agent run

1982
00:42:17.103 --> 00:42:18.523
our shell start command,

1983
00:42:18.523 --> 00:42:20.541
right? Scripts start, copy

1984
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:21.880
this and literally tell

1985
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.840
your agent create dot

1986
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.858
clause slash command slash

1987
00:42:25.858 --> 00:42:29.068
start and then as

1988
00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:30.166
a string, just give
