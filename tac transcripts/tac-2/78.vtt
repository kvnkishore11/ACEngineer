00:38:59.867 --> 00:39:01.027
knob dialed up to

1831
00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:02.586
11. And it's knowing

1832
00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:03.905
when there might be

1833
00:39:03.905 --> 00:39:05.146
issues that you'll have

1834
00:39:05.146 --> 00:39:07.405
to modify as you

1835
00:39:07.405 --> 00:39:08.643
augment and automate the

1836
00:39:08.643 --> 00:39:10.583
software developer lifecycle, okay?

1837
00:39:11.003 --> 00:39:12.123
This is presence. It

1838
00:39:12.123 --> 00:39:13.141
might seem crazy or

1839
00:39:13.141 --> 00:39:14.726
realistic, depending on your

1840
00:39:14.726 --> 00:39:16.005
experience level with Agentic

1841
00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:17.804
coding, that's fine. Throughout

1842
00:39:17.824 --> 00:39:19.003
TAC, throughout every single

1843
00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.003
lesson you complete, you'll

1844
00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:20.722
see that this is

1845
00:39:20.722 --> 00:39:21.902
not only possible, but

1846
00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:23.260
it's the future of

1847
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.559
engineering that you can

1848
00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:25.920
pull into the present

1849
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.378
right now. Okay, with

1850
00:39:27.518 --> 00:39:28.898
each lesson you complete,

1851
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:30.456
this vision will become
