1851
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:30.456
this vision will become

1852
00:39:30.496 --> 00:39:31.795
clearer and clearer to

1853
00:39:31.795 --> 00:39:32.896
you. Okay, there's of

1854
00:39:32.896 --> 00:39:34.014
course iteration along the

1855
00:39:34.014 --> 00:39:35.673
way. Of course, as

1856
00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:36.494
you scale up the

1857
00:39:36.494 --> 00:39:37.413
size of your work,

1858
00:39:37.652 --> 00:39:38.193
you'll have to put

1859
00:39:38.193 --> 00:39:39.032
more attempts in, you'll

1860
00:39:39.032 --> 00:39:40.172
break your streak, that's

1861
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:41.110
fine. We're gonna have

1862
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.931
high presence at the

1863
00:39:41.931 --> 00:39:43.710
beginning, but the goal

1864
00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:44.570
is that you have

1865
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.188
concrete KPIs you can

1866
00:39:46.188 --> 00:39:47.548
drive down, you can

1867
00:39:47.548 --> 00:39:49.547
drive to success, okay?

1868
00:39:49.547 --> 00:39:50.967
This is Agentic Coding,

1869
00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:52.367
this is tactical agentic

1870
00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:52.967
coding, this is how

1871
00:39:52.967 --> 00:39:54.206
we can know, right?

1872
00:39:54.206 --> 00:39:55.525
Not guess, not vibe,

1873
00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:56.226
this is how we

1874
00:39:56.226 --> 00:39:57.925
know we're improving, all

1875
00:39:57.925 --> 00:39:58.824
right? There are ways

1876
00:39:58.824 --> 00:40:00.664
to systematize this inside
