528
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.404
this? If we hop

529
00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:01.724
back to our IDE,

530
00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:02.783
if we go over

531
00:12:02.783 --> 00:12:03.703
here, we have a

532
00:12:03.703 --> 00:12:05.003
massive mistake. Not only

533
00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:05.822
do we have bad

534
00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:07.302
code, we have bad

535
00:12:07.402 --> 00:12:09.780
agentic code. Our server

536
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.120
is not printing out

537
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.440
the error at all.

538
00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:13.679
There's no way for

539
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:14.519
our agent to see

540
00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:15.418
what's going on. This

541
00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:15.938
is what it looks

542
00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.597
like when standard out

543
00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:19.313
is completely missing. The

544
00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:20.232
issue is getting bubbled

545
00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:20.893
up all the way

546
00:12:20.893 --> 00:12:21.673
to the front end

547
00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:24.011
without any trace throughout

548
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.032
the server or the

549
00:12:25.032 --> 00:12:26.551
client server. So let's

550
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:27.451
fix the code that

551
00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:29.110
enables our agent to

552
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.190
fix the issue. So
