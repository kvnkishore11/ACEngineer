676
00:14:59.413 --> 00:15:00.173
the following. I want

677
00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:03.692
to say scripts start.sh,

678
00:15:03.692 --> 00:15:05.510
300s. So now we're

679
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.289
kicking off our start

680
00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:08.302
script inside of our

681
00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:09.760
agent. Okay. Inside of

682
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.379
the current version of

683
00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:11.700
Claude Code, it only

684
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.158
shows the first parameter,

685
00:15:13.158 --> 00:15:14.378
right? Which we know

686
00:15:14.378 --> 00:15:15.057
from looking at things

687
00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:16.177
from our agent perspective,

688
00:15:16.177 --> 00:15:16.537
if we search for

689
00:15:16.537 --> 00:15:17.515
the bash command, the

690
00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:18.316
first command is of

691
00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:19.855
course the command that

692
00:15:19.855 --> 00:15:20.595
we want to execute.

693
00:15:20.693 --> 00:15:21.374
Okay. So we know

694
00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:22.472
the tools our agent

695
00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:23.432
has access to now

696
00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:23.913
let's put it to

697
00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:25.251
work. Let's really use

698
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:26.191
that leverage point. So

699
00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.250
it's running this right

700
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.529
now. That means it

701
00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.208
has access to standard
