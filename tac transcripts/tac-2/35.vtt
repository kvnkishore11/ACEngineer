804
00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:31.346
issues are. Okay. There's

805
00:17:31.346 --> 00:17:32.086
a small codebase,

806
00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:33.346
so it could easily

807
00:17:33.346 --> 00:17:34.345
do that. But when

808
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:35.065
you're operating in real

809
00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.644
codebases in production

810
00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:37.583
environments, you're going to

811
00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:38.383
have tons of files

812
00:17:38.383 --> 00:17:39.122
and you want to

813
00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:40.582
narrow down the scope

814
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:41.740
of where your agent

815
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.560
has to look. And

816
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.200
one great way to

817
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.059
do that one high

818
00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:45.179
leverage point of agent

819
00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:46.857
decoding is standard out.

820
00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:47.298
All right. So we

821
00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:48.217
have things working again.

822
00:17:48.237 --> 00:17:49.317
Instead of running this

823
00:17:49.356 --> 00:17:50.276
by hand, I'm just

824
00:17:50.276 --> 00:17:50.715
going to hit up

825
00:17:50.715 --> 00:17:51.496
a couple of times

826
00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:52.894
and kick this off

827
00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:53.454
again. If there are

828
00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:54.826
any additional issues, I

829
00:17:54.826 --> 00:17:55.744
want my agent to

830
00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:56.464
be the one managing

831
00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:57.144
them. All right, so

832
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:57.604
we're gonna fire that

833
00:17:57.604 --> 00:17:58.623
off again. Refresh the

834
00:17:58.623 --> 00:18:00.461
server, upload data, and
