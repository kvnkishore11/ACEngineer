362
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.358
database. So now we

363
00:08:30.358 --> 00:08:31.057
can do something like

364
00:08:31.057 --> 00:08:32.615
this list top five

365
00:08:32.615 --> 00:08:35.134
products by price. We

366
00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:35.933
can kick this off.

367
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:37.229
And of course our

368
00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.308
application will take that

369
00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:40.148
natural language query, convert

370
00:08:40.148 --> 00:08:40.927
it into an SQL

371
00:08:40.927 --> 00:08:42.067
statement, and then return

372
00:08:42.067 --> 00:08:42.946
the results from our

373
00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:43.965
database. This is a

374
00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:46.203
simple, beautiful, classic language

375
00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:47.743
model application. This code

376
00:08:47.743 --> 00:08:48.263
base will make a

377
00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:49.581
great playground we can

378
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.581
use to showcase the

379
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:51.961
leverage points of agentic

380
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:52.879
coding. If we open

381
00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.960
up our prime command,

382
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.578
you can see cloud

383
00:08:54.578 --> 00:08:55.857
code was asked to

384
00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:57.138
run the commands, read

385
00:08:57.138 --> 00:08:58.136
the file, and then

386
00:08:58.136 --> 00:08:59.696
summarize your understanding of

387
00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:00.816
the codebase. That's
