252
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.110
installation steps, which install

253
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.170
the front end and

254
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.009
the client. We can

255
00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:33.108
do this all with

256
00:06:33.108 --> 00:06:33.949
one prompt. We can

257
00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.468
type slash install. Out

258
00:06:36.468 --> 00:06:37.028
of the gate, we're

259
00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:38.288
using a custom slash

260
00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:39.127
command. This is a

261
00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:40.526
reusable prompt. If you

262
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.107
open up dot Claude

263
00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:43.485
slash commands, you can

264
00:06:43.485 --> 00:06:44.225
see all of the

265
00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:46.593
built-in baked in reusable

266
00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:47.913
prompts inside this code

267
00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:48.653
base. If you open

268
00:06:48.653 --> 00:06:50.252
up install, you can

269
00:06:50.252 --> 00:06:51.211
see exactly what just

270
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.451
ran there. Very simple,

271
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:54.230
seven line. We're reading

272
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.130
and executing an entirely

273
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.569
different prompt. And then

274
00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:58.649
we're having Claude Code

275
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.870
install the front end

276
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.288
and back end dependencies.
