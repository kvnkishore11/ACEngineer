883
00:18:59.962 --> 00:19:00.602
going on here. All

884
00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:01.021
right, so we can

885
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:02.342
say, show me how

886
00:19:02.981 --> 00:19:04.621
this type flows throughout

887
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:08.319
the application, detail functions,

888
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.159
files, and purpose. And

889
00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:11.679
then I'll just give

890
00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:12.818
it a format here.

891
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:13.838
So I'll say file,

892
00:19:14.239 --> 00:19:17.205
new line, file, function

893
00:19:17.205 --> 00:19:18.046
dot dot dot. Right.

894
00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:18.685
So it can just

895
00:19:18.685 --> 00:19:19.445
continue the pattern. So

896
00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:20.444
I'll fire that off.

897
00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:21.644
And now our agent

898
00:19:21.644 --> 00:19:22.964
is going to trace

899
00:19:22.984 --> 00:19:24.105
this throughout the applications.

900
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:24.765
You can see here

901
00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:25.644
it's firing off a

902
00:19:25.644 --> 00:19:26.924
task. What does task

903
00:19:26.924 --> 00:19:27.923
do? Let's go ahead

904
00:19:27.923 --> 00:19:29.044
and look at our

905
00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:30.203
tools, right? Because we
