905
00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:30.203
tools, right? Because we

906
00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:30.884
know exactly what our

907
00:19:30.884 --> 00:19:31.824
agent can see and

908
00:19:31.844 --> 00:19:33.003
do. We're thinking from

909
00:19:33.003 --> 00:19:34.403
our agent perspective. It

910
00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:36.083
is a sub agent

911
00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:37.262
for a keyword and

912
00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:38.423
file searches. It's firing

913
00:19:38.423 --> 00:19:39.143
off a sub agent

914
00:19:39.163 --> 00:19:39.803
to do work for

915
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:40.522
us. All right. So

916
00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:41.202
we're getting a bunch

917
00:19:41.202 --> 00:19:42.303
of commands fired off

918
00:19:42.303 --> 00:19:43.182
here. You can see

919
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.182
we're searching, check out

920
00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.241
the search, right? Pulling

921
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:46.961
together all the instances,

922
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:49.000
all the locations of

923
00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:50.058
this type. To be

924
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:50.759
clear, when I say

925
00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:51.958
types, I'm talking about

926
00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.416
classes, exceptions, interfaces, and

927
00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:55.976
all typing structures that

928
00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:57.255
represent a concrete piece

929
00:19:57.255 --> 00:19:58.453
of information in your

930
00:19:58.453 --> 00:19:59.653
codebase. Okay, so

931
00:19:59.653 --> 00:20:00.792
it's finished 26 K
