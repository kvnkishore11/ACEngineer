232
00:05:59.574 --> 00:06:01.514
terminal. Here we have

233
00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:02.473
the lesson one code

234
00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:03.812
base. Let's clone in

235
00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:05.891
TAC2, link available in

236
00:06:05.891 --> 00:06:06.810
your loop box below

237
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.430
if you wanna follow

238
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.189
along. TAC2 VS Code.

239
00:06:10.428 --> 00:06:11.608
So before we do

240
00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:13.208
anything, let's open our

241
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:14.346
Agentic Coding tool of

242
00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:17.113
choice, ClaudeCode. In order

243
00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:18.833
to fully transition into

244
00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:20.052
Agentic Coding, we need

245
00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:20.853
to lean on our

246
00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:22.172
agent as the primary

247
00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:23.372
interface in which we

248
00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:24.911
do engineering work. Let's

249
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:26.091
have Claude code teach

250
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:26.790
us about this code

251
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.230
base and run the

252
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.110
installation steps, which install
