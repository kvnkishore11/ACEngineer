435
00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:00.220
can do. Tools, as

436
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.599
you know, give your

437
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:02.798
agents the ability to

438
00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:03.778
act. But if you

439
00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:04.837
don't know the tools

440
00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:05.956
your agent can use,

441
00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:07.996
you can't maximize your

442
00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:09.235
agent to its highest

443
00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:10.775
capability. For instance, did

444
00:10:10.775 --> 00:10:11.934
you know that the

445
00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:13.774
bash tool here has

446
00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:15.190
a timeout? So if

447
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.750
you want to run

448
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.350
a long running bash

449
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.808
command and feed the

450
00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.448
output into Claude Code,

451
00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:21.068
you can set the

452
00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:22.389
timeout. There are many

453
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.488
little hidden kind of

454
00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:24.707
secrets inside of every

455
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:25.748
single tool, and it

456
00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:26.927
always helps to see

457
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:27.826
the definition and it

458
00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.027
always helps to know

459
00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:30.767
everything your agent can
