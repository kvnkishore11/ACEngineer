335
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:00.872
brand new terminal window

336
00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:02.031
here. Let's kick off

337
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:02.951
our front end and

338
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:03.951
our back end with

339
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.031
this script. Check out

340
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.110
this file before running

341
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.850
it. If you're running

342
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.870
on Windows, make sure,

343
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.470
of course, in WSL.

344
00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:10.134
And you can see

345
00:08:10.134 --> 00:08:10.932
here, this kicks off

346
00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:11.752
both our front end

347
00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:12.812
and our backend. So

348
00:08:12.812 --> 00:08:13.170
let's go ahead and

349
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.449
close our files here

350
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.528
and let's open the

351
00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.067
browser. What exactly are

352
00:08:17.067 --> 00:08:18.028
we running here? Here

353
00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:19.387
we have a simple

354
00:08:19.387 --> 00:08:21.564
natural language SQL interface.

355
00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:22.324
If we hit upload

356
00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:23.184
data, we'll start with

357
00:08:23.184 --> 00:08:24.302
a sample data set.

358
00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:25.362
We'll click the product

359
00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:26.480
inventory. This will create

360
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.579
a new table inside

361
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:29.199
of our in-memory SQLite

362
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.358
database. So now we
