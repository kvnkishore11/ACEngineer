1693
00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.670
mistake, this costs your

1694
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.929
most important engineering resource

1695
00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:04.108
your time. If your

1696
00:36:04.108 --> 00:36:04.987
attempts are high in

1697
00:36:04.987 --> 00:36:05.965
the five to 10

1698
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.603
range, even the three

1699
00:36:07.603 --> 00:36:08.762
to six range, you

1700
00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:09.422
need to spend more

1701
00:36:09.422 --> 00:36:11.141
time figuring out which

1702
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:12.219
of the 12 leverage

1703
00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:13.998
points you're missing, okay?

1704
00:36:13.998 --> 00:36:14.836
And you need to

1705
00:36:14.916 --> 00:36:15.755
employ it, right? You

1706
00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:16.715
need to use these

1707
00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:19.193
leverage points. Counterintuitively, iterating

1708
00:36:19.331 --> 00:36:20.570
is not good. There

1709
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.190
are some cases When

1710
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.429
you're doing exploratory work,

1711
00:36:23.429 --> 00:36:24.827
we're iterating is fine,

1712
00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:25.987
but we're moving toward

1713
00:36:25.987 --> 00:36:27.045
the space and the

1714
00:36:27.045 --> 00:36:29.184
place where even iteration,

1715
00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:31.043
right? Experimentation can be
