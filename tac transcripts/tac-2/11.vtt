214
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.459
them all the time,

215
00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.459
every day to get

216
00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:33.017
engineering work done. Through

217
00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:35.377
agents are external levers

218
00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.235
that eventually interact with

219
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:38.394
your agent that have

220
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:39.654
massive impact on your

221
00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:41.353
success. They typically flow

222
00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:43.012
through the context window.

223
00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:44.451
Here we have standard

224
00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:47.329
out types, documentation, tests,

225
00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.901
architecture, plans, templates, and

226
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.540
ADWs. Let's shift from

227
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.999
theory to some practical

228
00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.958
engineering using the 12

229
00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.276
leverage points of agentic

230
00:05:57.276 --> 00:05:58.396
coding. Let's go ahead

231
00:05:58.396 --> 00:05:59.574
and open up the

232
00:05:59.574 --> 00:06:01.514
terminal. Here we have
