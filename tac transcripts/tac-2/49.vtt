00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:30.672
Remember that everything you

1143
00:24:30.672 --> 00:24:31.332
name can be an

1144
00:24:31.332 --> 00:24:33.349
information dense keyword. If

1145
00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:34.868
you start muddying your

1146
00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:36.327
types and your data

1147
00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:37.346
models and you call

1148
00:24:37.346 --> 00:24:38.486
something, you know, something

1149
00:24:38.486 --> 00:24:39.625
even like this, right?

1150
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.344
Query request, query response,

1151
00:24:41.344 --> 00:24:42.702
not that good, right?

1152
00:24:42.702 --> 00:24:43.063
This is one of

1153
00:24:43.063 --> 00:24:44.102
those words that's like,

1154
00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:46.604
Data request, okay, terrible,

1155
00:24:46.604 --> 00:24:48.282
terrible name. There's not

1156
00:24:48.282 --> 00:24:49.182
a lot of information

1157
00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:49.922
here. If your agent

1158
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:51.080
ever wants to search

1159
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.200
for data or just

1160
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.877
request, it's cooked. Use

1161
00:24:53.877 --> 00:24:55.797
these information dense keywords,

1162
00:24:55.957 --> 00:24:56.935
name things, be a

1163
00:24:56.935 --> 00:24:58.474
little bit more verbose

1164
00:24:58.634 --> 00:24:59.693
and direct. You wanna

1165
00:24:59.713 --> 00:25:02.651
avoid large file sizes.
