point where you're running

1764
00:37:30.228 --> 00:37:30.847
back to back to

1765
00:37:30.847 --> 00:37:33.106
back successful agent decoding

1766
00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:34.346
prompts that shipping real

1767
00:37:34.365 --> 00:37:35.485
engineering work, right? You

1768
00:37:35.485 --> 00:37:36.525
want streaks of three,

1769
00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:37.903
streaks of five, streaks

1770
00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:39.164
of 10. An engineer

1771
00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:40.262
that can run, you

1772
00:37:40.262 --> 00:37:42.382
know, five one-shot agent

1773
00:37:42.382 --> 00:37:43.900

1774
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.340
entire features, right? Back

1775
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.219
to back to back

1776
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.079
over and over drastically

1777
00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.637
outperforms an engineer that

1778
00:37:49.637 --> 00:37:50.996
runs five prompts, but

1779
00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:51.996
had to fix three

1780
00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:53.155
issues per prompts, right?

1781
00:37:53.155 --> 00:37:54.875
That's three X slower,

1782
00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:55.753
right? The goal here

1783
00:37:55.753 --> 00:37:57.018
is simple. This KPI

1784
00:37:57.038 --> 00:37:58.617
tracks one thing. Once

1785
00:37:58.617 --> 00:38:00.255
you start one-shotting, don't
