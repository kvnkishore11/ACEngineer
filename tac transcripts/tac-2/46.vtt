1071
00:22:59.162 --> 00:23:00.280
high level overview of

1072
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.520
where everything is, but

1073
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.059
this is just a

1074
00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:03.220
starting point. Your agent

1075
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.199
still has to look

1076
00:23:04.338 --> 00:23:05.518
through files, figure out

1077
00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:07.573
where things are, and

1078
00:23:07.573 --> 00:23:09.112
navigate your codebase.

1079
00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:11.230
Your architecture stacks up

1080
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.450
very, very quickly for

1081
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.949
you or against you,

1082
00:23:13.949 --> 00:23:15.067
okay? I'm not gonna

1083
00:23:15.147 --> 00:23:16.487
invent a complex code

1084
00:23:16.487 --> 00:23:17.527
base to showcase this

1085
00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:18.885
leverage point because you

1086
00:23:18.885 --> 00:23:20.164
probably already have one.

1087
00:23:20.164 --> 00:23:21.364
You're probably already operating

1088
00:23:21.403 --> 00:23:22.183
in a complex code

1089
00:23:22.183 --> 00:23:23.063
base where things fall

1090
00:23:23.063 --> 00:23:24.942
apart somewhere in the

1091
00:23:24.942 --> 00:23:25.881
application structure. Okay. I'm

1092
00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:26.881
just going to list

1093
00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:27.661
off a couple of

1094
00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:28.559
important things that you

1095
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.240
should be doing in

1096
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.318
your codebases to
