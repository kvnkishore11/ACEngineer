2126
00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:31.322
can do. Once again,

2127
00:45:31.322 --> 00:45:32.242
we're going up the

2128
00:45:32.242 --> 00:45:34.199
abstraction chain. Once again,

2129
00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:35.659
English is the new

2130
00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:37.038
programming language and we're

2131
00:45:37.038 --> 00:45:38.257
just digging into that

2132
00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:39.436
fact and we're taking

2133
00:45:39.476 --> 00:45:40.635
it where it's going

2134
00:45:40.775 --> 00:45:42.295
before it gets there.

2135
00:45:42.434 --> 00:45:43.893
Okay? These leverage points,

2136
00:45:44.034 --> 00:45:45.773
the largest consistent impact

2137
00:45:45.773 --> 00:45:46.612
on your ability to

2138
00:45:46.612 --> 00:45:48.992
create engineering results with

2139
00:45:48.992 --> 00:45:50.432
one-shot agentic prompts now

2140
00:45:50.432 --> 00:45:51.391
this is important if

2141
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:51.952
you want to create

2142
00:45:51.952 --> 00:45:53.652
powerful sets of agents

2143
00:45:53.652 --> 00:45:55.211
and deploy them across

2144
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.431
the software development life

2145
00:45:56.431 --> 00:45:57.371
cycle like we're aiming

2146
00:45:57.371 --> 00:45:58.530
to do we must

2147
00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:59.831
know how to fire

2148
00:45:59.831 --> 00:46:01.389
off a single powerful
