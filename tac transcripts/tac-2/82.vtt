1920
00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:00.038
Are you still manually

1921
00:41:00.038 --> 00:41:01.657
looking at error messages?

1922
00:41:01.657 --> 00:41:04.336
Stop Stop. All right.

1923
00:41:04.456 --> 00:41:05.297
We're first going to

1924
00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:06.155
stop coding. But the

1925
00:41:06.155 --> 00:41:06.835
next thing to do

1926
00:41:06.835 --> 00:41:07.715
is stop looking at

1927
00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:09.054
error messages. Right. Give

1928
00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:09.954
them to your agent.

1929
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:10.954
And only when your

1930
00:41:10.954 --> 00:41:12.233
agent fails do you

1931
00:41:12.233 --> 00:41:13.753
take your precious time

1932
00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:14.632
and dig into the

1933
00:41:14.632 --> 00:41:15.233
error. All right. Make

1934
00:41:15.233 --> 00:41:16.271
sure you have standard

1935
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:17.311
out logging that your

1936
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:18.851
agent can see all

1937
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:19.710
the time as much

1938
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.791
as possible. This will

1939
00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:22.670
drop your attempts drastically.

1940
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:23.829
OK. If you're running

1941
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:25.309
short back to back

1942
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:27.027
iterative prompts, stop, sit

1943
00:41:27.027 --> 00:41:28.726
down, write some plans.

1944
00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.146
Right. Be more detailed.
