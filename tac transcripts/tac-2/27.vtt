601
00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:32.214
response before returning. Okay.

602
00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:33.653
And so what we're

603
00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:34.773
doing here is I'm

604
00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.571
not actually fixing the

605
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:37.671
issue. I'm setting up

606
00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:38.990
my codebase. So

607
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.090
that my agent can

608
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.028
resolve the issue. Okay,

609
00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:41.749
we're going into Yolo

610
00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:42.568
mode here. We don't

611
00:13:42.568 --> 00:13:43.648
want to be constantly

612
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:44.748
watching everything that's going

613
00:13:44.748 --> 00:13:45.467
on. We want our

614
00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:46.187
agent to do the

615
00:13:46.187 --> 00:13:46.927
work for us on

616
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:47.826
our behalf. So here

617
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:48.567
we go. Just doing

618
00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:49.527
a quick code review.

619
00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:50.365
You can see exactly

620
00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:51.426
what's happening here. Now

621
00:13:51.426 --> 00:13:52.825
we're printing to standard

622
00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:53.865
out both the error

623
00:13:53.865 --> 00:13:55.125
case and the success

624
00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:55.943
case. Okay, this is

625
00:13:55.943 --> 00:13:57.504
a big change. Now,

626
00:13:57.683 --> 00:13:58.183
if we hop back

627
00:13:58.183 --> 00:13:59.263
to our start script,

628
00:13:59.582 --> 00:14:00.523
cancel the front end
