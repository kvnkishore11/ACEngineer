1738
00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:00.206
to learn how to

1739
00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:02.443
create self-operating codebases

1740
00:37:02.443 --> 00:37:04.023
where agents operate on

1741
00:37:04.043 --> 00:37:05.262
our behalf, all right?

1742
00:37:05.483 --> 00:37:06.382
That brings us to

1743
00:37:06.382 --> 00:37:08.280
the next important KPI.

1744
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.400
These stack up on

1745
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.079
each other, as you

1746
00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:11.798
can see, right? Streak.

1747
00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:13.139
We want back to

1748
00:37:13.139 --> 00:37:14.556
back to back one

1749
00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:17.014
shot successes. Okay. We

1750
00:37:17.014 --> 00:37:18.152
want one shot agent

1751
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.949
decoding prompts with zero

1752
00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:21.228
issues. There's always kind

1753
00:37:21.228 --> 00:37:22.045
of a balancing game,

1754
00:37:22.045 --> 00:37:22.525
right? You want to

1755
00:37:22.525 --> 00:37:23.563
keep increasing your size

1756
00:37:23.563 --> 00:37:24.842
as you scale up.

1757
00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.561
You might have to,

1758
00:37:25.601 --> 00:37:25.960
you know, take a

1759
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.239
couple of attempts. That's

1760
00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:28.230
fine. But what you

1761
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.869
want to do is

1762
00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:29.289
get this to a

1763
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:30.208
point where you're running
