1218
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:00.722
ways to organize your

1219
00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:02.022
codebase. The main

1220
00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:02.541
thing is that you

1221
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:03.001
want to make it

1222
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:04.365
easy to navigate. By

1223
00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:06.565
making it consistent. Refactoring

1224
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.404
your codebase for

1225
00:26:07.404 --> 00:26:08.625
your agent is a

1226
00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:10.144
great idea and is

1227
00:26:10.144 --> 00:26:11.384
the refactor that will

1228
00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:13.344
pay you massive dividends.

1229
00:26:13.344 --> 00:26:14.344
But don't refactor yet.

1230
00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:15.284
In future lessons, we'll

1231
00:26:15.284 --> 00:26:16.284
cover how to organize

1232
00:26:16.284 --> 00:26:18.163
key agentic assets in

1233
00:26:18.163 --> 00:26:19.303
your codebase without

1234
00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:20.222
your agent and most

1235
00:26:20.222 --> 00:26:21.782
importantly, with your agent,

1236
00:26:21.883 --> 00:26:23.001
right? Your agent is

1237
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:23.741
going to be helping

1238
00:26:23.741 --> 00:26:25.501
you organize build and

1239
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:26.961
document everything in your

1240
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:27.940
codebase moving forward.

1241
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.459
Consistent architecture has a

1242
00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:31.518
massive long-term effect on
