1364
00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.016
loop. If you're not

1365
00:29:00.016 --> 00:29:01.135
writing tests, you're leaving

1366
00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:03.055
massive leverage on the

1367
00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:04.154
table. This used to

1368
00:29:04.154 --> 00:29:05.634
be a negotiable and

1369
00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:07.212
a debatable. Should startups

1370
00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:08.571
use these? Do engineers

1371
00:29:08.571 --> 00:29:09.432
just starting out need

1372
00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:09.971
to write tests? right

1373
00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:11.170
test. That time I

1374
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.508
think has completely passed.

1375
00:29:12.508 --> 00:29:13.047
If you're not writing

1376
00:29:13.047 --> 00:29:14.325
tests, you're probably vibe

1377
00:29:14.345 --> 00:29:15.583
coding. And at some

1378
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:16.461
point, if you want

1379
00:29:16.461 --> 00:29:18.597
your application to actually

1380
00:29:18.597 --> 00:29:19.701
be useful, to actually

1381
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:21.401
scale with your agents,

1382
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:22.319
you need tests so

1383
00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:23.900
that they can self-validate

1384
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.019
their own work. This

1385
00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:25.398
is one of the

1386
00:29:25.398 --> 00:29:26.998
highest leverage points of

1387
00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:28.357
Agentic Coding. If you're

1388
00:29:28.357 --> 00:29:29.557
not writing tests, this

1389
00:29:29.557 --> 00:29:30.616
is probably the first
