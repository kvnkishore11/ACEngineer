1533
00:32:29.148 --> 00:32:30.748
trigger. OK, here we're

1534
00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:31.407
going to be using

1535
00:32:31.448 --> 00:32:33.707
in ClawedCodes programmable mode.

1536
00:32:34.146 --> 00:32:34.967
If we close out

1537
00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:36.145
of this agent, type

1538
00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:37.586
Clawed-P and then we

1539
00:32:37.925 --> 00:32:40.305
type slash tools, right?

1540
00:32:40.505 --> 00:32:41.703
This is programmable mode.

1541
00:32:41.703 --> 00:32:43.104
We're running this right

1542
00:32:43.203 --> 00:32:44.343
from the terminal, not

1543
00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:45.742
in iterative mode, right?

1544
00:32:45.742 --> 00:32:47.001
I'm saying do this

1545
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:48.862
work, call this command,

1546
00:32:48.942 --> 00:32:50.260
whatever happens, return the

1547
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:50.840
result. You can see

1548
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.519
here, it's done, right?

1549
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.480
This is what we're

1550
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.539
gonna be doing inside

1551
00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.419
of ADWs, AI developer

1552
00:32:56.419 --> 00:32:57.419
workflows. This is where

1553
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:58.978
real engineering work can

1554
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.904
happen autonomously. This is
