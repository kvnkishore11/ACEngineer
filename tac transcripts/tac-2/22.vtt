00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:00.581
core four with tools

482
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.119
as the latest addition.

483
00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:03.178
Let's look at our

484
00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:05.297
through agent leverage points.

485
00:11:05.417 --> 00:11:06.775
Let's start with standard

486
00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:08.134
out. Your agent can

487
00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.274
only see what you

488
00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:10.533
let it see. Standard

489
00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:11.591
out is the response

490
00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:12.870
from any command you

491
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.809
run. Every time your

492
00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:14.889
agent runs a command,

493
00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:15.947
as we saw here,

494
00:11:15.947 --> 00:11:17.527
it's always getting some

495
00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:19.422
type of output. Some

496
00:11:19.442 --> 00:11:21.081
error, some response, some

497
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:21.620
lines of code red,

498
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.340
some directory structure, right?

499
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.840
It's all standard out.

500
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.499
This means that clear

501
00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:28.998
logging throughout your applications,

502
00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:30.216
your commands and your
