1314
00:27:58.988 --> 00:28:00.106
does it have the

1315
00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.346
right leverage it needs

1316
00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.085
to correct the mistakes?

1317
00:28:03.085 --> 00:28:04.025
This is where testing

1318
00:28:04.025 --> 00:28:05.463
comes in. Your back

1319
00:28:05.463 --> 00:28:07.163
ends are the easiest

1320
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:08.281
thing to test that

1321
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:09.721
offer massive leverage on

1322
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.240
your Agentic Coding. And

1323
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.440
of course, our tests

1324
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.239
are spitting out information

1325
00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:15.298
right to standard out

1326
00:28:15.377 --> 00:28:16.218
so your agent can

1327
00:28:16.218 --> 00:28:16.916
pick up on them.

1328
00:28:16.977 --> 00:28:18.236
Okay, so if right

1329
00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:19.276
here, I just ran

1330
00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:20.015
bang to run a

1331
00:28:20.015 --> 00:28:21.854
bash command, UV run

1332
00:28:21.854 --> 00:28:23.461
py test, Let's go

1333
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:24.461
ahead and CD into

1334
00:28:24.461 --> 00:28:25.359
the right directory here.

1335
00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:26.378
We can just run

1336
00:28:26.378 --> 00:28:27.077
this, right? So UV

1337
00:28:27.077 --> 00:28:28.136
run py tests, make

1338
00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:29.195
sure we're in bash

1339
00:28:29.195 --> 00:28:30.474
mode here. And you
