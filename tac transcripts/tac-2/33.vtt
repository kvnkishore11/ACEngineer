753
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.191
And now our agent

754
00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:31.570
is just doing all

755
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.389
the work for us,

756
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:33.710
right? Making sure agent

757
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.349
can read standard out

758
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.028
is a massive leverage

759
00:16:37.068 --> 00:16:37.908
point. If you're working

760
00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:38.427
on a codebase

761
00:16:38.427 --> 00:16:40.028
that produces tons of

762
00:16:40.028 --> 00:16:41.346
standard out enough that

763
00:16:41.346 --> 00:16:42.586
would overload your agent

764
00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:43.307
or blow up your

765
00:16:43.307 --> 00:16:44.605
agents context window, you

766
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:45.385
have a few options.

767
00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:46.413
You can create a

768
00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:48.373
dedicated per session log

769
00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:49.552
file that your agent

770
00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:50.971
can just read after

771
00:16:50.971 --> 00:16:51.870
the fact. Or you

772
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.830
can, of course, clean

773
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.889
up your log files

774
00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:54.988
that are likely too

775
00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:55.888
much for a human

776
00:16:55.888 --> 00:16:57.307
to read anyway. Or,

777
00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:57.907
you know, your last

778
00:16:57.907 --> 00:16:58.625
option here is you

779
00:16:58.625 --> 00:16:59.525
can set up your

780
00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:00.904
logging level to only
