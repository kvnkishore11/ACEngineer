it's finished 26 K

932

tokens, seven tool uses

933
00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:03.550
and check this out,

934
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.609
right? We have a

935
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:06.749
top to bottom flow

936
00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:07.948
of this type throughout

937
00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:09.346
the application. Okay. Just

938
00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.287
how you saw our

939
00:20:10.287 --> 00:20:12.001
agent searching here, This

940
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:12.861
is how you can

941
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:14.119
use types to track

942
00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:15.459
the flow of information

943
00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:16.518
throughout your application, right?

944
00:20:16.518 --> 00:20:17.576
This is a critical

945
00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:19.175
leverage point of agentic

946
00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:20.015
coding. This gives your

947
00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:21.354
agents the ability to

948
00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:22.913
look at flows of

949
00:20:22.913 --> 00:20:24.711
information throughout your code

950
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:25.930
base. All right. So

951
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.390
we go from data

952
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.189
model, servers, types, client,

953
00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:29.087
and then we have

954
00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:30.346
it detailed inside of
