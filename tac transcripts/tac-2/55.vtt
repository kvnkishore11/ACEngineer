WEBVTT

1289
00:27:29.842 --> 00:27:30.902
you remember here, if

1290
00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:31.340
we go back to

1291
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.660
our tools, Claude Code

1292
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.398
does have web fetch

1293
00:27:34.398 --> 00:27:35.419
and web searching tools.

1294
00:27:35.419 --> 00:27:36.382
This is just a

1295
00:27:36.382 --> 00:27:37.700
critical tool for engineering,

1296
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.259
which is why they

1297
00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:39.398
baked it in to

1298
00:27:39.398 --> 00:27:40.576
the agent. We have,

1299
00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:42.714
of course, tests. Tests

1300
00:27:42.714 --> 00:27:43.993
are mission critical. Let's

1301
00:27:44.133 --> 00:27:44.952
open up app, go

1302
00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:45.872
to server, and you

1303
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:46.471
can see here we

1304
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.849
have nice starter set

1305
00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:48.628
of tests here in

1306
00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:50.086
our codebase. Let's

1307
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:51.026
make this super clear.

1308
00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:52.784
Your agent will make

1309
00:27:52.784 --> 00:27:54.402
mistakes, okay, just like

1310
00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:55.829
you. Your agent is

1311
00:27:55.969 --> 00:27:56.808
bound to make a

1312
00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.768
mistake at some point.

1313
00:27:57.788 --> 00:27:58.988
The only question is,

1314
00:27:58.988 --> 00:28:00.106
does it have the
