1415
00:29:59.027 --> 00:30:00.426
up specs, we have

1416
00:30:00.446 --> 00:30:02.606
the initialize codebase

1417
00:30:02.727 --> 00:30:03.646
plan here. And so

1418
00:30:03.646 --> 00:30:04.086
you can look at

1419
00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:04.807
this, you know, it's

1420
00:30:04.826 --> 00:30:07.047
some 750 lines long,

1421
00:30:07.446 --> 00:30:08.487
lots of details, you

1422
00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:09.207
know, going into code

1423
00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:10.386
examples, front and back-end

1424
00:30:10.386 --> 00:30:12.006
types, high level, so

1425
00:30:12.006 --> 00:30:12.566
on and so forth.

1426
00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.125
Most engineers don't spend

1427
00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:15.905
enough time communicating what

1428
00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:17.006
they want done. Put

1429
00:30:17.006 --> 00:30:18.724
simply, Plans are just

1430
00:30:18.724 --> 00:30:21.063
prompts. Put accurately, plans

1431
00:30:21.063 --> 00:30:22.103
are how you communicate

1432
00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:24.121
massive amounts of work

1433
00:30:24.201 --> 00:30:25.400
to your agent. This

1434
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.338
is how we scale

1435
00:30:26.338 --> 00:30:26.919
up our work. This

1436
00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:27.458
is how we do

1437
00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.257
more in less time.

1438
00:30:29.457 --> 00:30:30.155
And as you may
