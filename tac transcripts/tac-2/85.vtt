1988
00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:30.166
a string, just give

1989
00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:31.106
it exactly what you

1990
00:42:31.106 --> 00:42:31.844
want in there. Then

1991
00:42:31.844 --> 00:42:32.784
you can reformat it

1992
00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:33.842
later. Start with the

1993
00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:35.440
bare minimum. Three time

1994
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.539
makes a pattern. Three

1995
00:42:36.539 --> 00:42:37.759
time should trigger your

1996
00:42:37.759 --> 00:42:39.936
engineering brain. Automate, right?

1997
00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:40.556
This is what prompt

1998
00:42:40.576 --> 00:42:41.554
templates allow us to

1999
00:42:41.554 --> 00:42:43.751
do. Automate work. Templates

2000
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.070
are big, big ideas

2001
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:45.650
we're gonna be looking

2002
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.065
at. Throughout Tactical agent

2003
00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:48.083
coding right now we

2004
00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:49.043
can boot up a

2005
00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:50.181
new agent whenever we

2006
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:51.322
need to right Claude

2007
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:52.760
slash start. What do

2008
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.579
you know? Check this

2009
00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:54.119
out. It's going to

2010
00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:55.458
start the server and

2011
00:42:55.458 --> 00:42:56.577
automatically listen to that

2012
00:42:56.577 --> 00:42:58.235
input for however much

2013
00:42:58.235 --> 00:42:59.634
time we give it

2014
00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:00.753
right. Very important stuff
