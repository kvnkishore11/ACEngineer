725
00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:00.284
see what it comes

726
00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:00.965
up with. There you

727
00:16:00.965 --> 00:16:02.004
go. There's an SQL

728
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:03.264
error trying to execute

729
00:16:03.264 --> 00:16:04.864
this likely contains special

730
00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:06.244
characters like parentheses that

731
00:16:06.244 --> 00:16:07.283
aren't being properly escaped

732
00:16:07.364 --> 00:16:08.864
or quoted. Fantastic. Our

733
00:16:08.864 --> 00:16:10.342
agent can now see

734
00:16:10.342 --> 00:16:11.102
everything that's going on.

735
00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:12.143
It can resolve the

736
00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:12.763
issue on its own.

737
00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:13.663
Okay, so we don't

738
00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:14.283
have to say much

739
00:16:14.283 --> 00:16:15.123
here. We'll just say

740
00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.601
resolve colon replace bad

741
00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.714
chars and escape. And

742
00:16:19.714 --> 00:16:20.614
so this is the

743
00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:21.633
power of standard out.

744
00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:22.153
Now our agent is

745
00:16:22.153 --> 00:16:22.673
going to read all

746
00:16:22.673 --> 00:16:23.332
the files it needs

747
00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:24.273
to and update the

748
00:16:24.273 --> 00:16:25.072
code so that doesn't

749
00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:25.672
break. Let's go into

750
00:16:25.672 --> 00:16:26.532
yellow mode here. All

751
00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:27.432
right. There's our new

752
00:16:27.432 --> 00:16:29.130
sanitized table name method.

753
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.191
And now our agent
