1644
00:34:59.487 --> 00:35:00.326
At the first level,

1645
00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:01.445
we have size. We

1646
00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:02.204
want to increase the

1647
00:35:02.204 --> 00:35:03.083
size of work we

1648
00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:04.123
can hand off to

1649
00:35:04.123 --> 00:35:05.601
our Agentic Coding tools,

1650
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:07.380
to our agents. Okay.

1651
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.820
If you're improving, you'll

1652
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.132
be increasing the size

1653
00:35:10.132 --> 00:35:11.438
of work, Right. So

1654
00:35:11.438 --> 00:35:12.496
this means writing bigger

1655
00:35:12.496 --> 00:35:14.097
plans and that means

1656
00:35:14.097 --> 00:35:15.016
that your larger plans

1657
00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:16.396
will likely consume more

1658
00:35:16.396 --> 00:35:17.815
time, which will correlate

1659
00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:19.713
to longer agent runs.

1660
00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:20.893
Right. If you've been

1661
00:35:20.893 --> 00:35:22.512
running five minute agentic

1662
00:35:22.512 --> 00:35:23.731
jobs, right, where your

1663
00:35:23.731 --> 00:35:24.532
agent goes off for

1664
00:35:24.532 --> 00:35:25.411
five minutes and works

1665
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:26.070
on your codebase,

1666
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.371
that's good. We want

1667
00:35:27.371 --> 00:35:27.951
that number to go

1668
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:29.829
up 10, 20, 30,

1669
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:31.289
an hour, three hours.
