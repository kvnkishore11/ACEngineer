2036
00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:30.414
the size of your

2037
00:43:30.414 --> 00:43:31.693
agentic prompts up and

2038
00:43:31.693 --> 00:43:32.452
the size of work

2039
00:43:32.452 --> 00:43:33.192
you can do up.

2040
00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:34.971
You send your attempts

2041
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.190
down to one per

2042
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.668
prompt. You increase your

2043
00:43:37.668 --> 00:43:38.829
streak so you can

2044
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:40.927
chain together success so

2045
00:43:40.927 --> 00:43:41.746
you can drop your

2046
00:43:41.746 --> 00:43:44.184
presence down to zero.

2047
00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:44.963
Okay, I hope you

2048
00:43:44.963 --> 00:43:45.922
can start to see

2049
00:43:45.943 --> 00:43:47.422
the vision of engineering

2050
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.780
we're creating, the vision

2051
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.739
of Agentic Engineering we're

2052
00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:52.418
creating. With this critical

2053
00:43:52.418 --> 00:43:54.101
tactic, And these 12

2054
00:43:54.101 --> 00:43:55.121
leverage points, you can

2055
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:56.780
start rapidly improving your

2056
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.559
agent to coding performance.

2057
00:43:58.639 --> 00:43:59.978
Now there's something important

2058
00:43:59.998 --> 00:44:00.958
to call out before
