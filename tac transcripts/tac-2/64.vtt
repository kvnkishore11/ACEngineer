00:31:59.118 --> 00:32:00.038
This is a code

1510
00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:01.157
base with empty set

1511
00:32:01.442 --> 00:32:02.401
of slash commands. Just

1512
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:03.141
to be super clear,

1513
00:32:03.141 --> 00:32:04.000
you want many, many,

1514
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.960
many commands that help

1515
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.059
you do real engineering

1516
00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:07.278
work at the drop

1517
00:32:07.278 --> 00:32:08.298
of a single slash

1518
00:32:08.298 --> 00:32:09.057
command. All right. We're

1519
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:09.617
going to be using

1520
00:32:09.617 --> 00:32:10.738
these a lot throughout

1521
00:32:10.758 --> 00:32:13.176
tactical Agentic Coding. ADWs,

1522
00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:15.115
aka AI developer workflows,

1523
00:32:15.115 --> 00:32:16.654
are the highest level

1524
00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:18.493
of abstraction. ADWs are

1525
00:32:18.493 --> 00:32:20.012
created when you combine

1526
00:32:20.012 --> 00:32:21.292
one or more agentic

1527
00:32:21.292 --> 00:32:22.692
prompts right out of

1528
00:32:22.692 --> 00:32:24.050
the commands directory and

1529
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.651
then you wrap it

1530
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:26.210
in arbitrary code and

1531
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.970
then you kick it

1532
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.148
off autonomously with a

1533
00:32:29.148 --> 00:32:30.748
trigger. OK, here we're
