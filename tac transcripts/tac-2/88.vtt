2058
00:43:59.998 --> 00:44:00.958
to call out before

2059
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:01.657
we move on to

2060
00:44:01.657 --> 00:44:03.157
lesson three. We're leaving

2061
00:44:03.157 --> 00:44:04.476
the beginner lessons and

2062
00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:05.717
moving into the intermediate

2063
00:44:05.717 --> 00:44:06.536
zone. We have to

2064
00:44:06.536 --> 00:44:07.456
call this out. We've

2065
00:44:07.456 --> 00:44:08.536
been using Claude Code

2066
00:44:09.094 --> 00:44:11.094
in phase one mode.

2067
00:44:11.793 --> 00:44:12.974
Okay, as I mentioned,

2068
00:44:13.054 --> 00:44:14.313
we've been prompting back

2069
00:44:14.313 --> 00:44:16.172
and forth very iteratively.

2070
00:44:16.271 --> 00:44:18.291
This tanks our presence

2071
00:44:18.311 --> 00:44:19.670
KPI, right? It literally

2072
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.909
drives it up every

2073
00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:23.286
interaction increases your presence.

2074
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.186
As we progress throughout

2075
00:44:24.206 --> 00:44:25.364
TAC, we'll be using

2076
00:44:25.523 --> 00:44:27.260
this mode right here,

2077
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.070
programmable mode. We'll be

2078
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.409
using Claude Code. We'll
