1389
00:29:29.557 --> 00:29:30.616
is probably the first

1390
00:29:30.616 --> 00:29:32.175
leverage point you should

1391
00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:33.875
go after right next

1392
00:29:33.894 --> 00:29:35.114
to standard out. We'll

1393
00:29:35.114 --> 00:29:36.334
dig into testing in

1394
00:29:36.334 --> 00:29:37.692
future lessons, right? Backend

1395
00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:38.512
testing is obviously a

1396
00:29:38.512 --> 00:29:39.791
lot simpler. We also

1397
00:29:39.791 --> 00:29:40.991
want front end tests.

1398
00:29:40.991 --> 00:29:41.590
We want our agent

1399
00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:42.270
to be able to,

1400
00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.351
you know, really look

1401
00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:44.210
at our front end

1402
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.490
to see the results

1403
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:45.949
of its work. We

1404
00:29:45.949 --> 00:29:46.509
want it to be

1405
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:47.388
able to click buttons.

1406
00:29:47.388 --> 00:29:47.887
We're going to look

1407
00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:48.667
at both front end

1408
00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:50.288
and back-end testing with

1409
00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.887
our agents throughout tactical

1410
00:29:51.887 --> 00:29:53.488
Agentic Coding. Let's talk

1411
00:29:53.508 --> 00:29:55.807
about plans. So this

1412
00:29:55.807 --> 00:29:57.067
is a popular high

1413
00:29:57.067 --> 00:29:58.287
leverage point of agentic

1414
00:29:58.287 --> 00:29:59.027
coding. If we open

1415
00:29:59.027 --> 00:30:00.426
up specs, we have
