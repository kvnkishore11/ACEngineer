1487
00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.734
leverage points. We have

1488
00:31:30.734 --> 00:31:32.492
templates and ADWs. So

1489
00:31:32.492 --> 00:31:34.271
this pushes us to

1490
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:35.830
the highest level of

1491
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.586
abstraction inside of our

1492
00:31:37.586 --> 00:31:38.625
codebase. We played

1493
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.144
with a couple templates.

1494
00:31:40.144 --> 00:31:40.865
Really, these are just

1495
00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.044
reusable prompts. There's nothing

1496
00:31:42.044 --> 00:31:43.263
we're templating out. These

1497
00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:43.903
are prompts we can

1498
00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:45.722
reuse and pass information

1499
00:31:45.722 --> 00:31:46.502
into. To use our

1500
00:31:46.502 --> 00:31:48.122
precise language, these are

1501
00:31:48.182 --> 00:31:50.201
agentic prompts, right? Prompts

1502
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:51.280
that can fire many

1503
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.701
tools thanks to Cloud

1504
00:31:52.701 --> 00:31:53.720
Code, right? Thanks to

1505
00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:55.539
Agentic Coding tools. You

1506
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:56.420
saw how much work

1507
00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.798
we did. Slash command,

1508
00:31:57.798 --> 00:31:59.098
slash command, slash command.

1509
00:31:59.118 --> 00:32:00.038
This is a code
