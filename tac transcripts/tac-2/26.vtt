578
00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.192
bunch of endpoints that

579
00:13:01.192 --> 00:13:02.171
if we drill into

580
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:03.471
it, they're not giving

581
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.710
any standard out, right?

582
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.529
These are all just

583
00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:06.828
raw responses. This is

584
00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:08.888
bad agentic code. Why

585
00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:09.668
is that? It's because

586
00:13:09.668 --> 00:13:11.028
our agent can't see

587
00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:12.246
anything. It can't help

588
00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:13.147
here at all. So

589
00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:13.966
we're gonna run this

590
00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:15.005
prompt here. I'm going

591
00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:15.884
to get the reference

592
00:13:15.884 --> 00:13:16.625
to this file. I'll

593
00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:17.663
type app. I'll use

594
00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:18.543
the at symbol for

595
00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:19.961
references. I'll search for

596
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.480
server.py. I'll tap complete

597
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.399
this. And then I'll

598
00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.178
say, make sure every

599
00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:27.476
exception, all exception details,

600
00:13:27.697 --> 00:13:29.696
make sure every successful

601
00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:32.214
response before returning. Okay.
