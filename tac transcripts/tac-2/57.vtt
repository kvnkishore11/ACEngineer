1339
00:28:29.195 --> 00:28:30.474
mode here. And you

1340
00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:31.114
can see here, we

1341
00:28:31.114 --> 00:28:31.753
are kicking off all

1342
00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:32.593
of our tests, right?

1343
00:28:32.593 --> 00:28:34.010
So all the output

1344
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.430
just ran and fed

1345
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.729
right into our agent.

1346
00:28:37.167 --> 00:28:38.686
Everything pass, so there

1347
00:28:38.686 --> 00:28:40.246
are no issues. If

1348
00:28:40.246 --> 00:28:41.005
there was an issue,

1349
00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:42.164
for instance, remember we

1350
00:28:42.164 --> 00:28:43.144
just added this new

1351
00:28:43.144 --> 00:28:45.603
functionality to our agent,

1352
00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:46.363
we can have it

1353
00:28:46.462 --> 00:28:47.582
execute the tests and

1354
00:28:47.582 --> 00:28:48.481
then improve on them

1355
00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:49.901
right away. You can

1356
00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:50.340
see where this is

1357
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.121
going. You can create

1358
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:52.740
self-validating loops. These are

1359
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.699
called closed loop structures.

1360
00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:55.219
This is where we

1361
00:28:55.219 --> 00:28:56.678
let our agent write

1362
00:28:56.678 --> 00:28:57.637
the code itself by

1363
00:28:57.637 --> 00:28:59.217
getting a concrete feedback

1364
00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.016
loop. If you're not
