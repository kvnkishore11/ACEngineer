1046
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:32.191
powerful actor against complexity

1047
00:22:32.191 --> 00:22:33.931
for both humans and

1048
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:35.690
for agents, right? And

1049
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.509
this is something that

1050
00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:38.272
It's so important and

1051
00:22:38.272 --> 00:22:39.711
widespread that I've called

1052
00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:41.810
this the agent navigation

1053
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.270
problem. Every time you

1054
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.829
boot up a new

1055
00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:44.930
agent, it has to

1056
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.909
explore the codebase,

1057
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:46.988
right? Even with our

1058
00:22:46.988 --> 00:22:48.147
prime command, right? If

1059
00:22:48.147 --> 00:22:48.647
we open up our

1060
00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:49.807
prime command and it

1061
00:22:49.846 --> 00:22:50.865
understands at a high

1062
00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:51.526
level, right? We can

1063
00:22:51.526 --> 00:22:52.644
always just copy this

1064
00:22:52.644 --> 00:22:53.305
and see what our

1065
00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:54.784
agent sees, right? New

1066
00:22:54.784 --> 00:22:55.963
terminal here, paste, get

1067
00:22:55.963 --> 00:22:57.022
LS files. You can

1068
00:22:57.022 --> 00:22:57.502
see what this is

1069
00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:58.461
giving your agent, right?

1070
00:22:58.582 --> 00:22:59.162
You get a good

1071
00:22:59.162 --> 00:23:00.280
high level overview of
