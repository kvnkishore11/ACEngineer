1190
00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:30.055
right. You want to

1191
00:25:30.055 --> 00:25:31.614
separate your services to

1192
00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:32.853
make things really clear

1193
00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:34.133
where things are at

1194
00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:35.311
a high level. Stick

1195
00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:37.431
to one responsibility per

1196
00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:38.809
file. You want to

1197
00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:40.049
sync your test file.

1198
00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:40.490
If we open up

1199
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.048
the server here and

1200
00:25:42.048 --> 00:25:43.068
we go to tests,

1201
00:25:43.249 --> 00:25:43.788
right, we can see

1202
00:25:43.788 --> 00:25:45.508
our tests represent the

1203
00:25:45.508 --> 00:25:46.748
exact same folder structure

1204
00:25:46.748 --> 00:25:47.707
as our server, right?

1205
00:25:47.747 --> 00:25:48.626
We have core and

1206
00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:49.586
we're testing everything in

1207
00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:50.286
the core, right? So

1208
00:25:50.286 --> 00:25:50.726
you want to mirror

1209
00:25:50.726 --> 00:25:51.286
these. It makes it

1210
00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:51.965
really easy for your

1211
00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:53.165
agent to see and

1212
00:25:53.165 --> 00:25:54.404
write tests. Obviously, we're

1213
00:25:54.404 --> 00:25:55.105
getting to test in

1214
00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:55.805
a moment here. That's

1215
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:57.584
a really important high

1216
00:25:57.584 --> 00:25:58.624
leverage point of agentic

1217
00:25:58.624 --> 00:25:59.623
coding. There are many

1218
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:00.722
ways to organize your
