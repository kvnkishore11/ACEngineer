## 🔑 Key Discoveries

### 1. The Core Innovation: ADW System
**Agentic Development Workflow (ADW)** is the revolutionary framework that:
- Transforms GitHub issues into pull requests autonomously
- Provides complete traceability via unique ADW IDs
- Enables zero-touch execution from requirement to deployment
- Represents a fundamental shift in software development

### 2. Five Universal Principles
1. **The Agentic Layer Principle** - Separate AI from application logic
2. **The Planning-First Principle** - Think before acting at every level
3. **The Isolation Principle** - Clear boundaries, single responsibilities
4. **The Traceability Principle** - Complete audit trails for all actions
5. **The Progressive Enhancement Principle** - Start simple, scale as needed

### 3. The Pattern Library
**45+ Patterns** organized across:
- Architectural Patterns (7)
- Prompting Patterns (8)
- Workflow Patterns (6)
- Context Patterns (5)
- Integration Patterns (6)
- Testing Patterns (5)
- Production Patterns (8)

### 4. Five Architectural Approaches (TAC-8)
1. **Minimum Viable Agentic Layer** - Specs + Commands + Workflows
2. **Scaled Agentic Layer** - Full production with all features
3. **Multi-Agent Task System** - Parallel processing via git worktrees
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration** - Strategic human oversight
5. **Domain-Specific Architecture** - Industry-specialized systems

### 5. The Seven Levels of Prompt Engineering
```
Level 1: Static Prompts           → Basic instructions
Level 2: Templated Prompts        → Reusable with variables
Level 3: Delegating Prompts       → Reduce context, delegate tasks
Level 4: Composable Prompts       → Modular components
Level 5: Adaptive Prompts         → Context-aware responses
Level 6: Generative Prompts       → Self-creating prompts
Level 7: Self-Improving Prompts   → Evolutionary optimization
```

### 6. R&D Framework (Reduce & Delegate)
**Context optimization strategy** achieving:
- 70% context window reduction
- 3x faster agent performance
- Improved focus and accuracy
- Scalable to complex systems
