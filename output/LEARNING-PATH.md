### Pitfall 2: Over-Engineering Simple Problems
**Problem**: Using complex patterns for simple tasks
**Solution**: Start with Minimum Viable, scale when needed

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Context Limits
**Problem**: Agents failing due to context overflow
**Solution**: Apply R&D framework early and often

### Pitfall 4: Monolithic Agent Design
**Problem**: Creating do-everything agents
**Solution**: Specialize agents for specific tasks

### Pitfall 5: Neglecting Error Handling
