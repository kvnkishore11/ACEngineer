## 📈 Evolution Through TAC Levels

The diagrams show clear progression through three phases:

### Foundation (TAC 1-3)
- Basic prompt engineering
- Command organization
- Workflow templates

### Automation (TAC 4-5)
- Agent introduction
- Pipeline creation
- Test automation

### Production (TAC 6-8)
- Enterprise governance
- Issue orchestration
- Zero-touch execution

### Mastery (Agentic Horizon)
- Metaprompting
- Custom agent building
- Elite context engineering
- Multi-agent orchestration

## 💡 Key Insights from Visualizations

1. **Complexity Emerges from Simplicity**
   - Simple rules create complex behaviors
   - Patterns compose into sophisticated systems
   - Each level builds on previous foundations

2. **Patterns Are Universal**
   - Same patterns appear at different scales
   - Workflows become reusable components
   - Systems are patterns of patterns

3. **Automation Enables Innovation**
   - Each level automates the previous
   - Freed capacity enables next-level thinking
   - Evolution becomes self-sustaining

4. **Context and Orchestration Are Critical**
   - Better context = better results
   - Orchestration patterns determine scalability
   - Communication protocols enable collaboration

5. **Decision Trees Codify Expertise**
   - Expert knowledge becomes algorithmic
   - Decisions can be automated
   - Troubleshooting becomes systematic
