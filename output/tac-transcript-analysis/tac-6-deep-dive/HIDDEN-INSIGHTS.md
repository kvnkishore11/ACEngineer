# TAC-6 Hidden Insights: Video-Only Revelations

*Critical insights, warnings, and future hints that only appear in the video teaching, not in the code or documentation*

## The Secret of Tactical Agentic Coding (Teased for TAC-7)

### The Big Reveal Coming
> "I'm gonna reveal the secret of Tactical Agentic coding. Understanding the secret is mission critical to your success in Tactical Agentic Coding. It's something that's been **hiding in plain sight throughout TAC** and it'll upscale everything we've done here in TAC. It's a **big idea that you may have noticed that starts small and then scales up**."

**What we can infer:**
- The secret has been present since TAC-1
- It's about scaling patterns
- Those who've been applying the tactics may have discovered it
- It fundamentally changes how we view everything learned

### Dangerous Mode Workflows
> "You can run entire AI developer workflows in **dangerous mode**, where we ship all the way to production. We're gonna showcase exactly what that looks like and how and when we would use this, because if you're on the edge of this stuff, I think you can start to see how and when we could use this, **not for big features, right? Not for serious work like that, but for maybe some bugs, maybe some chores**."

**Hidden capability not yet implemented:**
- Full production deployment automation
- Risk-based workflow selection
- Automated severity assessment for safe automation

## Technical Warnings & Pitfalls

### The Compact Command Problem
> "The compact command inside of Claude Code, maybe this will be resolved in the future, but this is a **bandaid fix**. If your agent is running compact, **it is losing information**."

**Critical warning:**
- Never mentioned in documentation
- Indicates data loss during agent operations
- Explains why single-purpose agents are crucial

### Vision Mode Gap
> "We don't have this dash dash vision. We're not operating in vision mode. **The tokens aren't flowing through the vision capabilities of our language model**."

**Missing capability:**
- Screenshots are captured but not analyzed
- Vision analysis would catch UI placement issues
- Token flow architecture consideration

### Model Intelligence Trap
> "Model intelligence is not a constraint. **Don't use this as an excuse. It will set you back. This is a losing mindset.**"

**Philosophical stance:**
- Don't wait for better models
- Build systems assuming current capabilities
- Focus on what you can control

## Engineering Philosophy Bombs

### The "Not About You" Moment
> "Why didn't you just do that by hand? You're missing the point... **This isn't about you anymore. Okay, this is about your agents.** It's about teaching your agents how to build on your behalf, right? So that **it can be about you again**."

**Paradigm shift:**
- Temporary ego death for long-term leverage
- Investment mindset vs. immediate gratification
- Building teacher systems, not doing systems

### The 80% Revelation
> "**80% of coding has been solved already by language models**, right? AI coding is not enough. It's not just about updating code, right? Engineering is about much more."

**Industry insight:**
- Coding is commoditized
- Engineering > Coding
- Focus on the 20% that matters

### The God Model Rejection
> "Generative AI companies, big tech, they're chasing the all-in-one, god model the super agent that can do it all but **that's not what we're doing here**... Let me just spoil it for you. **They won't, it's not here. It's not coming soon.**"

**Contrarian view:**
- Industry is chasing wrong goal
- Specialized agents > General agents
- Practical engineering > Theoretical AI

## Agentic KPIs Deep Dive

### The Four Metrics Mantra
> "We want attempts down, streak up, size up, presence down."

**Detailed breakdown from video:**
- **Attempts**: "We ran one prompt... This is the optimal state"
- **Streak**: "We did break our streak because we needed to call two AI developer workflows"
- **Size**: "The work that we did ship with that one prompt was solid"
- **Presence**: "Two moments of presence, one at the beginning for your prompt input, one at the end for your review and your PR merge"

### The Presence Evolution
> "In our next lesson, you can actually **push that further**. This is where things are going to start to feel and get a little wacky as engineers."

**Future capability hint:**
- Even less human presence possible
- "Wacky" suggests radical automation
- Beyond traditional engineering comfort zones

## Process Insights

### The Install Pattern Recognition
> "Our agent is setting everything up for us. **There is no reason to do this work by hand. You have agents use them.**"

**Cultural shift:**
- Every manual process should be automated
- No task too small for agents
- Immediate ROI on automation investment

### The Outloop System Philosophy
> "Thanks for our Outloop system, we were able to quickly identify this issue and just patch it... **out the loop, I just write this and then the webhook triggers the Outloop system to just get the job done.**"

**System design insight:**
- Webhook-triggered automation
- Issue comment → Full workflow
- Human writes intent, system executes

### The Testing Skip Lesson
> "It's also really important to note. I don't wanna keep harping on this too long, but it's important to note that **we did completely skip the test step**, right? Which operates and validates end to end... **testing very likely would have caught this issue**."

**Process validation:**
- Each SDLC step has unique value
- Skipping steps creates specific blind spots
- Review ≠ Testing (reinforced through failure)

## Mental Model Revelations

### The Eval Creation Pattern
> "By doing all this, you effectively **create evals for the agentic layer of your codebase**... You can change the model. You can add thinking mode. You can change your Agentic Coding tool. You can rerun these over and over."

**Advanced concept:**
- Prompts as evaluatable units
- Model-agnostic testing
- Passive eval formation in engineer's mind

### The Context Engineering Minimalism
> "You want to **context engineer as little as possible**. You want the **minimum context** in your prompt required to solve the problem."

**Counter-intuitive principle:**
- Less context = Better performance
- Minimum viable context
- Focus through constraint

### The Three Constraints Framework Detail
> "As agentic engineers, we have three constraints:
> 1. The context window
> 2. The complexity of our codebase/the problem we're solving
> 3. Our abilities
>
> **Specialized agents bypass two out of three of these**"

**Strategic insight:**
- Only human ability remains as bottleneck
- System design eliminates 66% of constraints
- Focus innovation on the remaining third

## Future Technology Hints

### The Cloudflare R2 Integration
> "We are going to set up some **Cloudflare environment variables** so that we can upload some image assets. This is gonna be really important for our review workflow."

**Infrastructure choice:**
- Cloudflare R2 over AWS S3
- Public bucket requirement for GitHub integration
- Asset management as core workflow component

### The MCP Configuration
> "We have this .mcp.json and we have a simple **Playwright configuration** that allows our agents to operate Playwright."

**Tool integration:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool access
- Playwright for browser automation
- Configuration-based tool enablement

## Workflow Velocity Insights

### The Review Velocity Focus
> "For Agentic Coding, this is **massively important for increasing your review velocity**."

**Why review velocity matters:**
- Review is the bottleneck in SDLC
- Visual proof accelerates decisions
- "Yes or no" decisions, not deep analysis

### The Single Swing Myth
> "Even with in-loop agentic coding **it doesn't happen in one swing**. There are steps, there's process, there's planning, building, testing, reviewing, and documenting."

**Reality check:**
- No magic bullets in engineering
- Process still matters with AI
- Steps can't be skipped, only automated

## Personal Moments & Humor

### The Jira Dig
> "Maybe you want to use a entirely different resource, right? Jira. **I can't imagine someone wants to use Jira**, but you know, you might want to use something like some Jira..."

### The Engineering Reality Check
> "We can even do it by hand **if we're being really dumb**. We both know that we can fix this instantly with a prompt."

### The Boots on the Ground Metaphor
> "We're solving real engineering problems **with our boots on the ground** with real work ahead of us."

## Critical Implementation Gaps

### The Documentation Reading Improvement
> "Something we could add here is inside of the instructions: **for every image you take, be sure to read it in during the review process**."

**Identified improvement:**
- Not yet implemented in code
- Would catch UI positioning issues
- Requires vision model integration

### The Background Process Lock
> "In my install script, it looks like my agent kicked off start on its own, which **locked up its loop**. So this is something that we can improve in the install command, right? **Make sure to be running on the background process**."

**Live debugging insight:**
- Real-time problem identification
- Agent workflow can self-interfere
- Background process management critical

## The Urgency Call

### The Final Push
> "**Great work here. Do not wait to start putting this stuff in your codebase.** Set up basic ADWs, set up basic agentic prompts, get your advantage, start rolling this into your code bases. **The value here is immense.**"

**Author's urgency:**
- Competitive advantage window
- First-mover benefits
- Immediate applicable value
