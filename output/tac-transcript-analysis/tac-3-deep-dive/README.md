## Key Discoveries

### 1. The Meta-Prompt Revolution
TAC-3's core innovation is **meta-prompts** - templates that generate plans that agents execute:
```
Template (meta-prompt) → Plan (prompt) → Implementation (execution)
```

### 2. The Fresh Agent Pattern
Counter-intuitive but powerful - new agent instances for each task:
- Maximizes context focus
- Ensures reproducibility
- Prepares for cloud deployment

### 3. The "THINK HARD" Secret
Information-dense keyword that activates Claude's reasoning model - a hidden feature revealed in the videos.

### 4. Template Engineering Philosophy
> "When you template your engineering, you encode your problem solving into reusable units that you, your team, and your agents can see, use, and importantly, improve."

### 5. The SDLC Automation
Complete automation of Plan → Code → Test → Review → Document lifecycle.

## Critical Insights

### 1. The "Irreplaceable Engineer"
You become irreplaceable not by writing better code, but by building better systems that write code.

### 2. The Paradigm Shift
From "AI helps me code" to "Agents do engineering while I orchestrate."

### 3. The Betting Strategy
Bet on what doesn't change (SDLC) while tools and models evolve.

### 4. The Teaching Method
The entire TAC series is itself a template for teaching machines - demonstrating the principles being taught.

## The Core Message

> "In order to become an irreplaceable engineer, we have to stop coding and learn to build systems that can operate on our behalf."

TAC-3 isn't just about using AI tools - it's about fundamentally transforming how we approach engineering. By mastering templates, meta-prompts, and the fresh agent pattern, you're not just keeping up with AI advancement; you're positioning yourself to leverage every future improvement.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone TAC-3
git clone [repository] tac-3
cd tac-3

# 2. Install dependencies
/install

# 3. Create your first plan
/chore "Add comprehensive logging"

# 4. Implement (new terminal!)
/implement specs/[generated-plan].md

# 5. Review and iterate
git diff --stat
```

## Final Wisdom

> "What was once a complete joke is now the most valuable skill any engineer can have. The prompt is everything."

The future belongs to those who can teach machines to engineer. TAC-3 shows you exactly how.
