Welcome to lesson seven, your second to last Tactical Agentic Coding lesson. Here we approach the edge of agentic coding. Here we ship end to end with our Outloop system to deliver more engineering value than we ever could before. In the next hour, you'll witness something most engineers dismiss as impossible,


[FILE: 3 - 1.vtt - TAC-7]
third level of agentic coding on the agentic engineering velocity scale. There are three levels in loop out loop and one additional level that we're going to break down in this lesson. Most engineers are operating in the loop throughout tack. You've learned how to construct powerful out loop systems that you're going to see in this lesson that clearly outperform out of the box agentic coding tools because they contain your engineering practices and your engineering workflows. But there's a level beyond Outloop


[FILE: 4 - 1.vtt - TAC-7]
a level beyond Outloop Systems. We'll understand a critical moment in the future where human in the loop review becomes a bottleneck, not a safety net. This tactic will lead us to the secret of tactical agentic coding. Let's collect the incredible dividends from our complete end to end Outloop agentic system. I wanna showcase that once you've invested in your Outloop system. Once you've built the system that builds the system, it's going to pay you back massively. Let's prompt and while our


[FILE: 5 - 1.vtt - TAC-7]
prompt and while our agents cook, let's review the codebase and then review their work. As we work through these, we'll address shortcomings, trade-offs and improvements we can make to this version of this Outloop system. And we'll discuss how you can move toward the next scale of Agentic coding. We are approaching the edge. These are the advanced lessons to the ideas here haven't arrived yet. but I wanna give you the greatest edge I possibly can. So let's get started and hand off more work than ever with the new agentic layer of


[FILE: 11.vtt - TAC-7]
products CSV export looks like this. We have the chart icon and then CSV, but if we select a product, you'll see something here We have mismatched text. Okay, so this is just a small, simple bug. So we wanna align this. This is gonna be a simple high level prompt. And here we're not even gonna use the full SDLC workflow, which I'll break down in a moment. We're going to use a simple patch workflow. Okay, so check this out, five issues. We're gonna fire them all off back to back. Our Outloop agentic system is gonna pick up all these events


[FILE: 26.vtt - TAC-7]
can say code trees, 8F. Let's actually use a real, let's use a real ID. So we have this agent operating here and this agent just implemented its solution. So if we copy this ID here, we can open up this agent environment right now. And we can just watch what's going on. So we open up this, we have a brand new instance, we're in the dedicated environment that this agent is operating in. Check this out. You can see the branch down there, right? Chore task issue 39, there's the ADWID. Okay. Think in the gray, we're not jumping to Outloop. We're progressively handing off more and more work to


[FILE: 40.vtt - TAC-7]
the power of the Outloop system. This is the power of investing in your agentic layer of your codebase. This is where scaled up agentic impact happens. Now, many engineers are going to gloss over this. They're not going to pay attention to this. They're going to stay in the loop and they're going to waste a bunch of time. Not you and I. CSV text doesn't match. This is a simple patch workflow. It looks like this completed a while ago. Great. So you do want to stay on the review system as much as possible, right? You want to build up your review system to be intricate, to be detailed so that basically you don't have to leave to know that


[FILE: 45.vtt - TAC-7]
our random data is still implementing. This is a big feature, it's running Opus. This is gonna be the ones where we might have to jump in, right? Go from Outloop to Endloop to kind of round out the implementation or understand what's going on. Our increase drop zone surface area has completed. This is fantastic. So all the work here is done and that means that we can check out the PR. So let's go ahead and open up this PR. I'm going to copy the branch Looks like we have 400 lines here. That's great. And now we're going to do some hands on review, right? Some in loop review.


[FILE: 61.vtt - TAC-7]
time you shipped a chore or bug or even a feature end to end. What happens next, right? When you get so good, when you template your engineering so well in your codebase, something will happen. Okay. I want to zero in on this idea here. Something is going to happen once you become proficient at Outloop agentic coding. You'll realize something incredible. This human in the loop model is a bottleneck. I'm not catching any bugs anymore. I'm not adding any value outside of the agentic layer. I'm going to remove the human in the loop review process for this class of


[FILE: 62.vtt - TAC-7]
for this class of problems. Once you come to this realization, and trust me, if you bet big and invest in your agentic layer, this will happen. You will arrive at the next order of magnitude the Agentic Engineering velocity scale first we're in the loop next we're out the loop and then we're doing z t e zero touch engineering you'll drop yourself off the end of the Outloop Peter framework and it becomes Pete not Peter you'll drop off the review, okay? This is the next


[FILE: 63.vtt - TAC-7]
This is the next step. Let me just be super clear about what this is. This is YOLO mode for your AI developer workflows. This is high confidence mode for agenting engineering. It's maximum confidence mode for agenting engineering. No review, right? Just like you've stopped coding, you'll stop reviewing. This is the lesson seven tactic. Target zero touch engineering. This is the ultimate agentic coding Northstar. This is what your agentic coding KPIs lead you toward. Attempts at one, size constantly scaling up,


[FILE: 64.vtt - TAC-7]
size constantly scaling up, streak constantly increasing as you solve and ship problem classes back to back to back with one attempt and you'll drop your presence down to one. You'll let your agent ship end to end. When you do this, you've achieved zero touch. Engineering. The best Outloop agent decoders have a presence of two. You show up at the prompt and you show up at the review, just like we were here, right? Our presence for this drag and drop feature was two. Okay. We increased it by going into the loop, but we only needed two,


[FILE: 72.vtt - TAC-7]
more. And then let's talk about the secret of tactical, logistic coding. What has this all been leading up to? You can see here, we've built up to these incredible Outloop systems. Our codebase is running itself and we're coming in to make sure things look good. We're spending our time, building the system that builds a system. And I know a lot of engineers, when you look at the zero touch engineering scale of agent decoding, you might think that this is impossible. There's no way you're letting agents ship to production in your real production application, right? Yes, I completely agree with you. We're operating on a simple toy application. There's no real


[FILE: 90.vtt - TAC-7]
velocity scale. This is an advanced edge next level concept, but this is something you wanna be working toward. This is the tactic of lesson seven. Target zero touch engineering. In the end, you want no overview, no oversight because it's been embedded into your agents, right? Your agents have gotten so good and your templates have gotten so great that your agents know how you would do the work. And you know, how is this possible? It's only possible because you've encoded your engineering. You've told your agents, you've instructed your system, you've trained your system to know when things are ready for production. Right, maybe you add another step on


[FILE: 97.vtt - TAC-7]
it has been deployed to production, okay? The issue is closed. All I did was write this prompt. Update the background color. Of course, yes, it's like we've talked about. This is just a starting point. Agents can push more than this. They can do more than this, but it's all about progression, think in the gray and don't reject the ideas of the future. Target zero touch engineering. This is the tactic of lesson seven. This is your North Star when you are building out the agentic layer of your code base. In the back of your head, you wanna think, how can I build this so that I can gain confidence to one day


[FILE: 99.vtt - TAC-7]
coding. All right, so what happens next? Take a moment to just appreciate what we've done here. We have seen the future of where this is all going, right? We've transcended the traditional engineering velocity scale in loop, Outloop zero touch coding. You understand that the agent layer is the highest leverage point in your code base. This is the place where one X input becomes 10 X output and 10 X input becomes 100 X if you invest in this layer, okay? everything I've shown you, everything we've worked through in TAC so far, the plan, build, test, review, and document is just


[FILE: 101.vtt - TAC-7]
you organize AI developer workflows, ADWs. You'll want to resist this and you'll doubt that Outloop and ZTE are the future of engineering, but this is the crux of tactical agent decoding. This is the real challenge I have for you in this course. It's not about the code. The ideas are powerful, but the most important thing is that you must update your beliefs. This is a belief change that you must make for 10 to 100x scaled engineering with agents. And once you do this for yourself, something incredible will happen. Once you truly


[FILE: 113.vtt - TAC-7]
workflows in dangerous mode, where we ship all the way to production. We're gonna showcase exactly what that looks like and how and when we would use this, because if you're on the edge of this stuff, I think you can start to see how and when we could use this, not for big features, right? Not for serious work like that, but for maybe some bugs, maybe some chores, we can start to run entire workflows in yellow mode but i'll see you in lesson seven where we dive in to the secret of Tactical Agentic Coding the secret of Agentic Coding great work here do not wait to start putting


[FILE: 114.vtt - TAC-7]
wait to start putting this stuff in your codebase set up basic adws set up basic agentic prompts get your advantage start rolling this into your code bases the value here is immense i'll see you in lesson seven we're going to reveal the secret of agentic engineering
