## 🔥 Key Concepts Summary

### The 12 Techniques at a Glance

**Beginner (Foundation)**
1. **Measure to Manage** - You can't optimize what you don't measure
2. **Avoid MCP Servers** - Save 10-25% instantly
3. **MORE Prime, Less CLAUDE.md** - Dynamic > Static context

**Intermediate (Delegation)**
4. **Control Output Tokens** - They cost 3-5X more
5. **Use Sub-Agents PROPERLY** - Partially forked context windows
6. **Architect/Editor Pattern** - Separate planning from building

**Advanced (Optimization)**
7. **Avoid Compact - Reset & Prime** - Know your context exactly
8. **Use Context Bundles** - Instant context restoration
9. **One Agent for One Purpose** - Focus beats breadth

**Agentic (Bleeding Edge)**
10. **System Prompt Control** - Deep behavioral modification
11. **Primary Multi-Agent Delegation** - Parallel independent agents
12. **Agent Experts** - Self-improving specialized systems

### The Context Engineering Equation

```
Optimal Context = Minimal Essential Information + Zero Waste + Perfect Distribution
```

### The Evolution Journey

```
Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert → Master
   ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓         ↓

## 💻 Quick Start Implementation

### The 5-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Clean your context
rm .mcp.json
echo "# Project\nMinimal info" > CLAUDE.md

# 2. Create concise output
mkdir -p .claude/output-styles
echo 'Success: "Done."' > .claude/output-styles/concise.md

# 3. Launch optimized
claude --no-mcp --settings .claude/settings.concise.json

# Result: 40K+ tokens saved immediately
```

### Your Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start fresh
/clear && /prime

# Check regularly
/context  # Monitor growth

# Reset at 50K
/clear && /prime_[task]

# Delegate heavy work
/background "Complex task" opus report.md
```
