## 🔑 Key Concepts at a Glance

### The Core Innovation: ADW System
**Agentic Development Workflow** - A revolutionary approach that transforms GitHub issues into completed pull requests autonomously.

### The Framework: PETER
- **P**rompt Input (GitHub Issues)
- **E**nvironment (Dedicated sandbox)
- **T**rigger (Webhook/Cron/Manual)
- **E**nvironment (Memorable redundancy)
- **R**eview (Pull Requests)

### The Philosophy: "Stay Out The Loop"
> "While other engineers are sitting at their device, prompting back and forth... you'll have built a new agentic layer around your code base where you stay out the loop and let your product build itself."

## 📊 By The Numbers

- **105** Video segments processed
- **8** Comprehensive documents created
- **4** Modules in the TAC progression (TAC-1 → TAC-4)
- **12** Leverage points of agentic coding
- **6** Specialized agents in the pipeline
- **17** Minutes average for autonomous feature implementation
- **10x+** Velocity improvement potential

## 🚀 The TAC Evolution

## 💡 Most Important Insights

### From Video Analysis:
1. **"Your agent is brilliant, but blind"** - The fundamental truth about AI agents
2. **"Adopt your agent's perspective"** - The key mental model shift
3. **"Fix the system, not the issue"** - The automation mindset

### From Code Analysis:
1. **ADW ID System** - Unique tracking for every workflow
2. **Agent Specialization** - Each agent masters one task
3. **Multi-layer Observability** - GitHub comments + file logs + metrics

### From Hidden Insights:
1. **Use Opus for complex tasks**, Sonnet for demos
2. **Start with chores**, then bugs, then features
3. **Dedicated environments are crucial** (Mac Mini recommended)

## 📈 Impact Metrics

Based on the author's teachings and real implementations:

| Metric | Before TAC-4 | After TAC-4 |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Feature Implementation | 4 hours | 17 minutes |
| Human Involvement | 100% | 5% |
| Error Rate | Medium | Very Low |
| Scalability | Linear | Exponential |
| Engineering Focus | Writing code | Building systems |

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal

> "In order to become an irreplaceable engineer, we have to stop coding and learn to build systems that can operate on our behalf."

This collection gives you everything you need to make this transition from code writer to system architect to automation orchestrator.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone TAC-4
git clone [tac-4-repo]

# 2. Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 3. Create a GitHub issue
# Title: "Add JSON-L support"

# 4. Run your first ADW
cd adws
uv run adw_plan_build.py 1

# 5. Watch the magic happen
# Issue → Plan → Code → PR in ~17 minutes
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You've mastered TAC-4 when:
- ✅ Your GitHub issues automatically become PRs
- ✅ You spend more time reviewing than coding
- ✅ Your velocity has increased 5-10x
- ✅ You're building systems, not features
- ✅ Your codebase literally runs itself
