## 🎓 TAC-8 Overview

### What Is TAC-8?

TAC-8 is the **FINAL and CULMINATING** module of Tactical Agentic Coding that:
- Synthesizes all concepts from TAC-1 through TAC-7
- Presents 5 complete, production-ready applications
- Demonstrates different architectural patterns
- Shows how to build the "Agentic Layer"
- Completes your transformation into an Agentic Engineer

### The 5 Applications

1. **Agent Layer Primitives** - Foundation patterns
2. **Multi-Agent Todone** - Parallel task processing
3. **Out-Loop Multi-Agent Task Board** - External orchestration
4. **Agentic Prototyping** - Rapid development
5. **NLQ to SQL AEA** - Domain-specific systems

### Core Innovation: The Agentic Layer

> **"Imagine a ring around your codebase. At first it's thin, then it becomes thicker as you scale agentics into your codebase."**

The Agentic Layer is:
- A architectural boundary around your application
- Where you spend >50% of your engineering time
- The system that builds the system
- Your path to 10-100x productivity

## 💡 Key Concepts Summary

### The Core Philosophy
> **"Build the system that builds the system"**

You should spend >50% of your time on the agentic layer, not the application layer.

### The Final Tactic
> **"Prioritize Agentics"**

This single tactic encompasses all others from TAC-1 through TAC-7.

### The Secret Revealed
> **"It's not about the software developer lifecycle at all. It's about composable agentic primitives."**

Everything is a building block that can be composed into solutions.

### The Guiding Question
> **"Am I working on the agentic layer or am I working on the application layer?"**

Ask yourself this daily to ensure you're moving in the right direction.

### The Technical Principle
> **"One agent, one prompt, one purpose"**

Avoid context pollution by keeping agents focused and specialized.
