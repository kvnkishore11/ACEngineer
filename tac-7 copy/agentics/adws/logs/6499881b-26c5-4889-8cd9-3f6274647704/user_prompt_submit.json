Management: Deterministic port allocation for parallel execution\nIsolation Architecture:\nGit Worktrees: Complete repository isolation in trees/{adw_id}/\nPort Isolation: Each ADW gets unique backend/frontend ports\nEnvironment Isolation: Separate .ports.env and dependencies per worktree these are couple of aspects of tac-7 ensure that you had all of them implemented and i want u to validate thoroughly.. feel free to use playwright mcp server if u need to do the end to end testing for this"
